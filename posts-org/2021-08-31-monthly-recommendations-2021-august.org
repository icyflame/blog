This month's theme is *art and the artist.* I chose this theme because events in my life have
reminded me of the value of the abstract and incomprehensible. As places around the world open up
under varying levels of restrictions, the contemporary locations and events were art is showcased,
namely, cinemas, theaters, live concerts and art museums, are returning to their earlier glory and
posing an interesting question to a subset of the population that has the luxury of deciding whether
they want to attend: *How much risk are you willing to take to see an artist perform live?* This
month's list begins with an art critic who argues that our appreciation of art from the times when
life expectancy was low is bound to increase, owing to our own deeper experience of mortality
through pestilence. The list also includes articles about the perpetual search for the line between
art and the artist and about the limits of on-screen fantasy and escape, when the spectator's real
life is in disarray.

1. *Out of Time (Schjeldahl)*

	[[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/13/mortality-and-the-old-masters][New Yorker]] ([[https://archive.is/OdohI][archived]]), 13th April, 2020

	I like going to museums of all kinds: art, natural history, national artifacts, museums
   memorializing disasters. A quote that I read in a museum in Taiwan 3 years ago has remained with
   me: "If we seek to understand the present and predict the future, the past is our only guide."
   Schjeldahl, a venerable art critic, writes about what differentiates the experience of seeing art
   in person and seeing it on a computer screen or on a virtual tour. He also writes about the
   overwhelming presence of death in ancient art; mortality was experienced an integral part of life
   in the years when life expectancy was low and the reasons for death included even the most
   mundane causes such as the common cold, compared to current times when it borders around the
   periphery during normal times and when one thinks about death only as the consequence of severe
   disease or disaster.

	He also writes about our return to art museums, a topic that I am particularly interested in. I
   have been able to go to art museums and live concerts over the past year, during the brief period
   that the pandemic let up in Japan in September and October 2020. As the relaxation continues and
   more people return to art museums, I wonder if their tastes have changed and if we end up being
   more enamored with the art of the "Ancient Masters" from having suffered through daily reminders
   of the fragility of life in the form of case numbers.

2. *Fearless Pianist (Ross)*

	[[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/igor-levit-is-like-no-other-pianist][New Yorker]] ([[https://archive.is/yHrdk][archived]]), 18th May, 2020

	This is the profile of a German pianist who is also a political activist. It delves into the
   question of separating the Art that is produced by the artist and the artist themselves. This
   question has haunted both artists and spectators for a while now. Over the past year, with the
   accusations that sprung up against comedian Louis CK and the new documentaries about musicians R
   Kelly and Michael Jackson, the question pushed through into the mainstream and reached a
   population that had remained insulated. The ultimate decision about whether the connection
   between art produced by an artist and the artist's actions and opinions must be (necessarily)
   left up to each individual. This article poses this question forcefully in the instance where the
   artist's political opinions don't align with your own. It made me think about the artists that I
   adore and how I would react to similar situations that involved them. I think that questioning
   and clarifying your beliefs before the situation arises is the only way to stay /sane/ and
   continue to patronize their art, respect the artist and defend yourself to others. Kendrick Lamar
   poses the same question more succinctly in his song Mortal Man from the album To Pimp A
   Butterfly:

	#+begin_quote
	If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off

	If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car

	Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?

	...

	When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

3. *Hot and Toxic (Goodyear)*

	[[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/16/jordan-wolfsons-edgelord-art][New Yorker]] ([[https://archive.is/Msyet][archived]]), 16th March, 2020

	Following along on the separation between art and artist, this profile of the artist Wolfson
   focuses on the provocation that he sees his art as a vessel for. In this case, the artist's
   personal beliefs are not reflected in their art. In fact, the art is designed specifically to
   incite the spectator into thinking about ... /something./ Being "edgy" has been an asset for
   artists like Pollock, who thrived on abstract art with no definite interpretations. Everyone drew
   on the canvas that Pollock had already drawn on; albeit they started with a slate that was packed
   with material and guided their thoughts through particular paths, not letting them wander
   aimlessly. Wolfson's art is being made in the age of the Internet and career ending mis-steps can
   come out of the artist's inherent belief about the role of art in society. Is it safe, then, to
   step outside the mainstream and create provocative art?

4. *"All the Natalie Portmans" and The Limits of Hollywood Fantasy (Cunningham)*

	[[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/16/all-the-natalie-portmans-and-the-limits-of-hollywood-fantasy][New Yorker]] ([[https://archive.is/RRFop][archived]]), 16th March, 2020

	I liked this article on two levels. The first level was for the content: It is an amazing review
   of a play which features a young teenager who dreams of being a screenwriter and idolizes the
   actors who have made it big in the 2000s. The second level was for the effortless references that
   the author draws on about Portman and her role in building a fantasy. She mentions several of
   Portman's movies and her recent Oscar appearance. Coincidentally, I happen to be reading Dyer's
   [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/351864.Heavenly_Bodies?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=5I51BtcxSP&rank=1][Heavenly Bodies]], an essay about how stars are made and what society really looks for in them.

	*P.S.* This article introduced me to Dior ad campaign that stars Portman:

5. *Chain Me Up: Harry Houdini and The Art of Escape (Denby)*

	[[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/harry-houdini-and-the-art-of-escape][New Yorker]] ([[https://archive.is/31BIU][archived]]), 30th March, 2020

	Houdini is a household name today. What was he escaping from? Was there some meaning to his art
   and work? Or was it meaningless and simply the culmination of Houdini's personal desires?
   Houdini's defiance of authority figures and the police in particular takes center stage in his
   work. He demonstrated the crass, anti-authority culture of rebellion through an art form that
   captivated everyone. But what he did was not sleight of hand or magic; his escapes were /real/
   acts of strength backed by an endless amount of preparation and presented with a complete lack of
   showmanship, which has traditionally been the mainstay for magicians.
