Here's the *noble lie* about democracy: The electorate holds the ruling party accountable for their
actions when they were in office. This is taught in school classrooms, in political science courses,
and is drilled into the minds of children who have the good fortune of growing up in a liberal
democracy. The lie is revealed when they realize that the electorate is unwilling or unable to hold
the ruling party accountable and that the ruling party is able to entice the electorate with
populist schemes that are announced [[https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-government-announces-gold-loan-waiver-hours-before-poll-dates-2379180][hours before campaigning begins]][fn:1]. There is a tedious and
disheartening conversation about why no country has realized this ideal state of democracy in
practice and been able to maintain it in the long term; a conversation that mentions education,
media, self-interest and capitalism as some of the causes. This post does *not* engage in that
conversation. Instead, I focus on a core component of this system: *Access* to public services such
as education, healthcare, and a competent local government. I contend that this is the /silver
bullet/ which will allow countries to reach the ideal state of democracy and stay there in the long
term.

* The Noble Lie

Let's look at the lie in some detail:

1. The electorate votes for a political party every few years
2. The elected political party forms a government and works for the welfare of a majority of the people
3. When the next election comes along, the political party campaigns on their credentials. Namely,
   the changes they brought about in society during their term in office and their plan for the
   future as documented in their election manifesto
4. The electorate hears all this rhetoric and looks /objectively/ at the government's performance
5. At the voting booth, the electorate holds the government /accountable/ for their actions during
   their past term, by voting for either the same party, signaling to them that they did a good job,
   or for the opposition party, signaling to them that they did not live up to the electorate's
   expectations
6. If the ruling party loses, then they go back to the drawing board and await the next election
   cycle
7. Whichever party lost the election will become the new opposition and will keep a close eye on
   what the government does. They will find counter-arguments to every policy that the ruling party
   puts forth
8. =GOTO= Step (1)

At least one of the above steps is broken in all of today's liberal democracies[fn:7].

Step (2) has never /really/ worked. The government is focused on winning the next election and does
what will work out best for their current and potential supporters; not bothering too much with the
ardent supporters of the opposition party. The stickiness of political ideologies supports this
approach. If one were to assume a utilitarian point-of-view, the limited resources that the
government has access to *must* be used to safeguard their path to office in future election
cycles. There have been a handful of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYbY45rHj8w][astonishingly selfless]] politicians, such as the conservative
party in Australia who implemented gun control at the cost of their political futures. These
politicians are the exceptions that prove the rule.

Step (4) is universally broken. The electorate learns about what the government has done through the
media and the media is regulated by the government. This is a conflict of interest for the
government. Media organizations have their own ideal state which they have not achieved and the
failure to live up to the requirements of step (4) are the result of knock-on effects of dependent
systems, each of which is far from its ideal state. I have written about [[http://localhost:4000/news/journalism/media/critique/2021/03/13/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites-1-motivation-and-methodology/][this]] [[http://localhost:4000/journalism/critique/2021/05/08/journalism-without-context/][problem]] [[http://localhost:4000/news/series/2018/07/30/news-media-expectations-1/][before]].

Step (5) is broken in countries where the government has expansive, unchecked powers over
spending. In effect, the government is empowered to bribe the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_voter_theorem][median voter]] through populist
schemes. The government can thus side-step the requirement of "performing" when in office, but still
convince voters on the campaign trail. There are also [[https://www.thehindu.com/news/the-india-cables/lsquoCash-for-votes-a-way-of-political-life-in-South-Indiarsquo/article14949621.ece][out-of-band methods]][fn:2] like "Cash for
votes" schemes to convince voters, though these are less frequently documented due to their nature.

Step (6) is hard to adhere to for an enterprising political party. The ruling party is unwilling to
reevaluate their policy platform or the changing demography of a country following an election
loss. This refusal to change has lead to endless shouting matches on nightly news shows and
walk-outs from legislative bodies that accomplish absolutely nothing in the Parliamentary system of
governance that exists in India and Britain. It's utility is [[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/31/us/politics/texas-voting-bill-.html][questionable]] in separation-of-powers
democracies like America. In an astonishing example from America, the losing side embarked on [[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/podcasts/the-daily/voting-rights-georgia.html][a
national campaign]] to disenfranchise supporters of the winning side in early 2021.

Here, I will end this inventory of the failures of democracy and move on to my core argument.

* What is "Access"?

"Access" is an ambiguous concept. I will define it a bit more concretely for our purposes here:

#+begin_quote
Access is the access to public services like education, healthcare and a competent local
government. These are things that private individuals can not do as efficiently as the
government. . Apart from the big ones that I have enumerated, we should also consider pensions for
the elderly, rations for the poor, opportunities for the unemployed and public transport for all as
essential public services.
#+end_quote

I think these are the two determinants of /how much/ access someone has during their formative
years.

First, Access is dictated by geographical location, with people in urban areas having better access
due to the higher per-capita government revenue and the government's enhanced ability to recruit
talent willing to inhabit these areas. People in rural areas generally have little or no access to
essential services and are often compelled to go considerable distances to procure them. Anecdotes
about Indians walking several kilometers every day to go to school or college are commonplace even
as recently as the 1990s or 2000s.

Second, it is determined by socioeconomic position. The wealthy landowner in a rural area has the
ability to shuttle their children to school or move closer to the school for a period of time, while
everyone else is left behind. Further gradations become visible as children move to higher levels of
education; the entrance exams for several Engineering colleges in India are [[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/will-language-barrier-impede-aspirants-success-in-jee-advanced/articleshow/79489211.cms][held only in English and
Hindi]][fn:3], excluding students who studied in schools where regional languages were the medium of
teaching.

This difference within members of the electorate profoundly impacts what they do as participants in
the democratic system.

* Why is Access Important?

To understand the importance of access, I will break the election process into three separate
stages: the pre-election stage of electoral polls and campaigning, the voting stage, and the
post-election stage of measuring government performance.

** Before the election: Polling and Campaigning

The impacts of access at this stage are under-discussed. Political parties use private and public
polling[fn:4] to gauge what the electorate /wants/ to hear them talk about. Who gets polled depends
on how much access they have. The most common method for polling in America is calling people up on
telephones. Someone who does not have a telephone is not likely to be polled and their opinion
remains unheard by political parties before the election.

In smaller economies and middle-income countries, the problem becomes even bigger. Internet
penetration in India is [[https://www.statista.com/statistics/792074/india-internet-penetration-rate/][about 45%]] which reduces the utility of online polls like [[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/polls][this one]].

Looking at traditional polls like India Today's [[https://www.indiatoday.in/mood-of-the-nation-survey-2020][Mood of the Nation 2020]] poll, we notice the
difference between the country's literacy rate and the literacy rate of the people who were polled;
while [[https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/literacy-rate][about 75%]] of the people in India were literate in 2018, about 96% of the people polled were
literate. This gap makes the poll /less representative/ because of 5 illiterate people in India,
only 1 person got the opportunity to voice their opinion. The poll's coverage of the whole country
is also spotty with only 97 of the 543 Lok Sabha constituencies surveyed. This poll is decidedly not
the mood of the nation. Rather, it's the mood of the people within the nation who have the most
amount of access[fn:5].

Campaigning is less of a problem related to access because political parties campaign in places
where there are /persuadable/ voters. These places are generally chosen irrespective of the amount
of access they have. A politician will travel as far as they need to if they can get an audience
with a few thousand persuadable voters.

So, if you (or counterparts in your cohort) are not being polled routinely and diligently, then your
options for getting your opinions to politicians are limited. One potent option which is widely
recommended is to "get involved in local and regional politics" and talk to the politicians who are
closest to you and explain your concerns to them. Each democracy provides it's own method of
accomplishing this.

America provides the public forum and town council meetings, whose inefficiency and ineffectiveness
is immortalized by the excellent TV show, [[https://youtu.be/areUGfOHkMA][Parks and Recreation]]. Decentralized democracy generally
provides multiple levels of politicians starting from a local counselor or panchayat leader (in
towns and villages in India) going up to a member of the state or federal legislature. I think that
this option is mostly touted for /show/.  People at these levels are impossible to find, meet or
talk to. Their functionaries are equally powerful and (generally) just as absent. Above all, this
assumes that the duty of a citizen extends well beyond the duty of voting in an election: If they
want to get their opinions out, they have to find someone who can effect change and proactively tell
them about it. This seems like a dream and is not backed by anything that exists in reality.

There are some caveats to my opposition to this idea. The implementation of democracy has varying
levels of imperfection across the world. Thus, theoretically, it is possible that a democracy
somewhere in the world has really good processes which allow the voice of everyone to be heard. [[https://theprint.in/opinion/this-data-shows-why-indian-mps-dont-truly-represent-their-people/201769/][At
scale]], I don't think that *expecting* citizens to be proactive is acceptable. Incentivising the
government and political parties to employ [[https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/][private companies]] who do surveys and weight the results
appropriately to represent the whole country sounds like a much better option to me.

** During the election: Voting booth

Access to the voting booth is an important part of democracy that democracies generally do /better/
at. There are few complaints about these. While citizens might struggle to get their voices heard
/before/ an election, when an election comes around, politicians would generally like to lock down
the reliable voters who will vote for them and will be in favor of policies that bring them into the
fold.

I will offer one minor and one major instance where access to the voting booth is systematically
limited.

The minor caveat comes from India. India runs the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWldvqO4AIY][world's biggest election]] every 5 years. In
[[https://eci.gov.in/files/file/10991-2-highlights/][2019]][fn:9], 910 million people were eligible to vote, while 610 million people actually voted,
resulting in a polling percentage of 67%. These votes were cast over 5 weeks to elect 543 Members of
Parliament. These numbers are staggering. The polling percentage in particular is comparable to
[[https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/record-high-turnout-in-2020-general-election.html][American turnout]] during the 2020 Presidential election, an older democracy which has several
features for convenient voting such as early voting, mail-in ballots, and same-day registration,
which are missing from the Indian election process.

The lack of these convenience features makes it nearly impossible for someone who isn't close to
their assigned voting booth in an election. For anyone to vote in an Indian election, they must be
registered to vote and have a voting slip. The voting slip specifies the polling booth that has been
assigned and one is required to present oneself at the polling booth, on the assigned day, between 9
am and 5 pm (or a similar time period). This geographical restriction is an annoyance and creates a
bias towards people who stay in the same place for a long time. In an economy that is still largely
agrarian, these concerns are inconsequential[fn:6].

The major instance of systemic denial of access to the voting booth emanates from the politician's
desire to empower reliable voters who will vote for their party, while simultaneously finding
dubious methods to disenfranchise reliable voters of the opposition party. There is really nothing
more to say about this; if democracy is about convincing the electorate to vote for you and you are
in charge of including and excluding people from the electorate, it makes complete sense to prevent
the people who will not vote for you from being a part of the electorate. The Republican party in
the American South decidedly went over the cliff on this in early 2021 and [[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/podcasts/the-daily/voting-rights-georgia.html][wholeheartedly committed]]
to disenfranchise a large block of voters; their policies have been outrageous and they have not
bothered to even present these policies in a palatable form. This kind of disenfranchisement was
going on in the form of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-4dIImaodQ][Gerrymandering]], the American process of periodically redrawing districts to
bunch up a party's supporters into reliable constituencies while breaking up the opposition's
supporters into multiple districts so that they don't are unable to form a majority in either. While
that was an obscure form of distorting the electorate's powers, preventing [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/03/04/attacking-sunday-voting-is-part-long-tradition-controlling-black-americans/][Sunday voting]] is a direct
and indefensible form of exclusion.

** After the election: Measuring government performance

Approval ratings are calculated using surveys that ask people some form of a straightforward
question: "Do you approve of the current government's performance?". By keeping the question simple,
they aim to capture the public's approval of the job that a government is doing, implicitly assuming
that the public will take into consideration all the various things happening in the country. It is
a purposefully coarse metric which tells people about the present. It is not very helpful in the
long run, except for direct comparisons between different leaders (even for the comparison case, the
usage of approval numbers is suspect because of the differing conditions that a leader has to deal
with when they come into office).

[[https://morningconsult.com/form/global-leader-approval/#section-56][Morning Consult]]'s weekly poll gives us some idea of the approval ratings for leaders around the
word.

[[file:~/personal/blog/public/img/morning-consult-global-leader-approval.png]]

The methodology of the survey determines the final number and different numbers can be found for
[[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating][America]] on FiveThirtyEight's approval poll average and for [[https://www.nhk.or.jp/senkyo/shijiritsu/][Japan]] on NHK, the state broadcaster's
monthly survey of about 2000 people.

These numbers can be easily goosed and have wide short-term variations. For instance, when Modi, the
Prime Minister of India, [[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html][announced]] a nationwide lockdown to contain the COVID19 pandemic in March
2020, his net approval shot up from 52% on March 21st (3 days before the announcement) to 63% on
March 27th (3 days after the announcement). This increase is not very meaningful as the effects of
the lockdown were not visible yet. When the disastrous effects of the lockdown became apparent, the
net approval returned to it's original level around 53% in June 2020, nearly 3 months after the
initial announcement.

Measuring the Government's performance is a tricky task for any citizen. Access plays a pivotal role
in this; specifically, the citizen's access to information, their ability to process this
information, and their ability to come to an independent conclusion (free of peer pressure and
intimidation). All these facets of access are determined by the amenities available in her
neighborhood in the present and the opportunities she was able to avail in childhood. People who are
illiterate or physically challenged have been systemically excluded from the information ecosystem,
although the advent of [[https://youtu.be/TiP7aantnvE][accessibility tools]] such as screen readers and platforms such as YouTube with
content in several regional languages is gradually filling this access gap. We should be cautious in
becoming too optimistic though as access to the Internet is far from perfect, /even/ [[https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data][some advanced
economics]].

Free and good quality primary and secondary education is also facing several obstacles and on this
front, there is a wide gap between various countries. When one looks at the amount of time that
schools and other educational institutions were asked to stop functioning during the COVID19
pandemic, I think we saw the attitudes of governments towards the education of their citizens. While
schools remained closed in most of America and India for several months, Japan and France rushed to
open their schools as soon as the first waves of the pandemic ended and doctors were able to
understand the disease better.

As [[https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/schools-arent-superspreaders/616669/][evidence mounted]] showing that the spread of the disease in schools is limited and can be
curtailed using common-sense measures such as masks and social distancing, some countries responded
by implementing these measures and reopening schools, while others decided to forget about them due
to upcoming state elections. The Indian government went [[https://zeenews.india.com/india/cbse-cisce-board-exams-2021-cancelled-here-are-top-5-updates-2365981.html][one step further]] and canceled the year-end
exams for CBSE, a nationwide education board, impacting 15 million students who were to take these
exams in April 2021. The exams were canceled without any clues about what their replacements will
look like and the whole thing was a huge communication failure which left a lot of students anxious
about both the near- and long-term.

These decisions were made at different points during the pandemic and support for them is divided
among the electorate. I don't know of any poll that has asked people about their opinions on how
important it is to open restaurants and movie theaters compared to opening schools. The Economic
Survey in 2020 [[https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/][found]][fn:8] the drop-out rate in secondary education in India (age 10 to 17) to be
about 19.89%. This number is bound to have increased during the pandemic. It is a near certainty
that the past year of [[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-21/coronavirus-school-closures-will-hurt-kids-and-worsen-inequality][school closures will increase social inequality]] in the coming decades.

[fn:4] For this post, I consider polling to be the systematic science of calling up probable voters
and asking them questions, in order to gauge the public's opinion on social, political and economic
issues.
[fn:5] I have made some assumptions here. Namely, I have assumed that this poll covers the easiest
places to survey: urban and semi-urban places where access to telephony is high and people are
reachable by various modes of communication. The names or economic attributes (such as the median
income of the polled constituencies) of the 97 constituencies that were polled are not available in
the "Methodology" section of the poll. Given this lack of information, I have decided to *not* give
the benefit of the doubt to the polling agency, because they have not explained their weighting of
the survey results or whether they have employed statistical processes to deal with minor
inaccuracies in surveys or the differences between the sample's population and the country's
population.
[fn:6] In a hilarious turn of events, one of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkkyaodksT4][the successful movies]] in 2018 showed the protagonist,
who is loosely based on Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, coming back to India to cast his vote and the
drama that ensues when he realizes that someone else has (illegally) voted on his behalf.
[fn:7] This is probably a pessimistic view, an overstatement and a simplification of the nuanced
reality. But the inaccuracy of this statement is well within the tolerances that I have set myself
for evaluating the performance of a democracy, so I will let it slide.
