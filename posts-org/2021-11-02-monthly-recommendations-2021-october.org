I have tried to stay away from COVID-19 on this blog. Most people are writing nearly constantly
about it and I don't have many original takes on this topic. But this month, I reverted back to a
way-of-life that was typical for me before the pandemic began. I traveled to another city to meet
relatives; I went on a vacation; I traveled to some places in the city that I am in; I went out to
restaurants and dined-in. These experiences signal a return to normalcy which seemed unlikely in
March 2020, 18 months ago. These experiences also shined light on a change within myself: I have
gotten used to *not* being among strangers. Going back to a previous lifestyle, seeing and listening
to strangers again has been an interesting return to normal. (I am glad that the "new normal" was
transient.) So, this month's theme is *a receding pandemic.* I look back at some of the articles
which I read at various milestones during the pandemic, starting from the beginning of the pandemic
in Japan last year, through the emergence of the vaccines, and right up to the most recent article
about the long-term effects of this crisis.

1. *Existential Inconvenience (Dyer)*

	[[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/the-existential-inconvenience-of-coronavirus][New Yorker]] ([[https://archive.md/GtiGt][archived]]), 23 March, 2020

	This article was written right when the pandemic was beginning. Realizations like "knowing that
   you will not be able to do something is better than knowing that it is still possible but
   unlikely" seem obvious. But having them articulated at you is also clarifying. I am not sure why
   that is the case. (I am trying to figure that one out still.) The author calls these "existential
   inconveniences," I think that's an apt name. They don't really rise up to the level of problems
   (For e.g., I could not see Bob Dylan perform live in Japan in April 2020 because his show got
   canceled.) but they are at least inconveniences.

2. *Memoranda (Rozzo)*

	[[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/war-poems-of-the-pandemic][New Yorker]] ([[https://archive.md/BdMoB][archived]]), 18th May, 2020

	War analogies are morose. But they are also effective because every war has an enemy, and all
   wars [[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/08/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-end-of-the-war-in-afghanistan/][end]], even the ones that seem to drag on forever. These two crutches are required for
   prolonged belief in the proverbial "light at the end of the tunnel." This article is a set of
   poems written by a soldier who arrived in New York during the worst art of the pandemic
   there. The soldier (who remains anonymous) was able to write poetry to capture the moment and
   escape from it himself. The poetry is simple and beautiful; at times, it simply restates
   facts. But I am not sure I would be able to write something this good when I need to focus on
   crisis management; and this is the main reason I am recommending this piece. It's a reminder
   about what's possible when one is in an unprecedented situation.

3. *Weaponizing Uncertainty in COVID-19 Lab Leak Theory (Rogers)*

	[[https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-lab-leak-theory-weaponized-uncertainty/][Wired Magazine]] ([[https://archive.md/Wdx9X][archived]]), 20th May, 2021

	There was [[https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Declassified-Assessment-on-COVID-19-Origins.pdf][a recent report]] from the US intelligence community about the origins of COVID-19. (I
   have not read the full report; I have read the first few pages and reporting about it.) Indulge
   me and pretend that new evidence matters. Indulge me further and pretend that new evidence has
   the power to change already formed beliefs/opinions/facts. The report can be used to prove any
   opinion that the reader has already arrived at. For e.g., for those who /believe/ that China is
   not to blame for the disastrous handling of the pandemic in US, Europe, and UK, they can go to
   this line:

	#+begin_quote
	Area of Broad Agreement: Virus not developed as biological weapon; Virus not genetically
	engineered
	#+end_quote

	And for those who want to blame China, they can use this line:

	#+begin_quote
	China's cooperation most likely would be needed to reach a conclusive assessment of the origins
	of COVID-19.  Beijing, however, continues to hinder the global investigation, resist sharing
	information, and blame other countries, including the United States.
	#+end_quote

	Even though the report goes on to say that "Beijing's lack of cooperation on origins not
   diagnostic of either hypothesis," this second point is mostly glossed over in second-hand
   reporting of this report. It says that the report does not explicitly blames China for the virus,
   but it does blame China for not sharing enough information. The retort that everyone is familiar
   with rises: "If they don't have anything to hide, why are they not sharing all the information
   that they have?"

	I will not pretend to have any answer. I am fairly certain that there *is* no answer. Even if
   there is one, this answer will not be found. So, what is the point of all this coverage of the
   virus' origins? Biden needs to win the mid-terms; Europe needs a scapegoat for their disastrous
   handling of the pandemic; Most other countries have upcoming democratic elections where voters
   will demand to know why their government failed where China succeeded. This take is clearly
   cynical; and this article supports this take from the point of view of weaponized uncertainty:
   Not being able to find something casts suspicion on the institution which most likely has the
   /coveted/ evidence.

4. *Moderna's Next Act Is Using mRNA vs. Flu, Zika, HIV, and Cancer (Langreth)*

	[[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-07-14/moderna-mrna-targets-hiv-cancer-flu-zika-after-covid-vaccine][Bloomberg Businessweek]] ([[https://archive.md/Az4SO][archived]]), 14th July, 2021

	How did we get a vaccine for the coronavirus so soon? The strategy of using a vaccine as the
   path out of COVID-19 was considered reckless and foolhardy in March 2020. "Vaccines take years to
   make. The earliest period of time in which we have been able to develop safe vaccines in the past
   was 4 years." Policy makers had different reactions to these warnings from vaccine
   scientists. Vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer and Moderna stayed quiet and worked on finding the
   vaccine. The announcements in November 2020 about the 90+% efficacy that vaccines had shown in
   Phase 3 clinical trials was perhaps the best piece of news in the past year. This article
   explains why the mRNA approach to vaccines is modular and configurable, features which are at the
   core of scalability in software, and apparently also in vaccine development. This article
   elaborates on how mRNA could turn into the ticket out of future pandemics and existing incurable
   diseases.

5. *We're Losing Our Humanity, and the Pandemic Is To Blame (Smith)*

	[[https://www.propublica.org/article/were-losing-our-humanity-and-the-pandemic-is-to-blame][ProPublica]] ([[https://archive.md/v8W8L][archived]]), 7th October, 2021

	The pandemic has been the comfortable scapegoat for a lot of uncomfortable truths that have come
   to light in the past few months. Particularly, about "losing humanity," I wonder if the changes
   we have seen in behaviors over the past 1.5 years were just latent tendencies which were
   triggered by the pandemic. The ongoing pandemic is a mix of three things: a once-in-a-lifetime
   crisis, a conspiracy theory breeding ground, and an event that increases fervor about already
   held beliefs. The period of lockdowns in 2020 was also the first time in my lifetime where I had
   limited contact with strangers for that long a period of time. This has made returning to the
   world and interacting with strangers again a shocking experience. Recently, returning from a
   vacation, I found that many of the strangers around me were in an anxious and nervous state which
   made them take actions which lacked empathy and considerateness. This was not something that I
   was noticing for the first time; nevertheless it hit me like a rock wall and left me confused for
   a few days. For that feeling of confusion, I am *certain* that the pandemic /is/ to blame.
