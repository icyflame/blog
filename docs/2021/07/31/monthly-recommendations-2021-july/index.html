  <p>This month’s theme is <strong>cities, islands and the places that we live in.</strong> Few events in my life have
triggered as much introspection about the city that I live in and the places that I go to as the
ongoing pandemic. Over the past year, people have left cities and retreated into the countryside,
finding that their work remains unaffected even if they don’t go to offices and don’t meet their
coworkers in real life. But how should we account for the damage to the <em>city’s fabric</em> because of
these exits? Optimists continue to believe that things will go back to the way they were and that
there will be no long-term impact due to this aberration that we are living through; I count myself
in this group, foolhardy as it might be to expect a future identical to the past. Revolutionaries
and activists see the leveling of lifestyles between geographies as a step towards equality, a
spiritual return to the mixed socioeconomic class communities that were fixtures of towns and
villages up to the late 19th century. In an effort to explore this ongoing change more fully, this
month I recommend a photo essay that documents a nurse’s daily life, an article about the differing
paths for social change depending on the average income of the district that you live in, and an
essay about how the place that you grow up in is embedded within your personality.</p>

    <p><strong>A City Nurse (photo essay) (Remnick)</strong></p>

    <p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/04/a-city-nurse">New Yorker</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200509193717/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/04/a-city-nurse">archived</a>), 4th May, 2020</p>

    <p>As the COVID-19 pandemic started taking hold and hospitals around the world, starting with Italy
and then New York and then pretty much everywhere at once, dealt with a huge number of
hospitalizations, politicians started expressing gratitude to essential workers at the beginning
of all their speeches. Indian leaders started extolling these people as <a href="https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/fallen-warriors-indias-healthcare-workers-during-covid-19/cid/1792886">“warriors.”</a> These
rhetorical changes did not go hand-in-hand with policy changes that might alleviate unprecedented
pressures on underfunded healthcare systems. This photo essay details the life of a nurse who
went through the worst parts of the pandemic in New York. This was a powerful reminder that the
people working inside hospitals were put on a pedestal, but nothing was done to protect them or
to improve their lot by politicians <strong>and</strong> society at-large. The gratitude expressed never turned
into collective action (wearing masks, social distancing) or policy action (building large field
hospitals, preparation for subsequent waves). Cady Chaplin, the nurse profiles in this article,
reacted to the platitudes with matter-of-fact stoicism:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Many evenings, at seven, Chaplin can hear the cheering and honking, the nightly tribute to the
“essential workers” who are keeping the city alive. The sound often makes her tear up with
gratitude, but she is wary when she hears platitudes about the “heroic” work of health-care
professionals. She doesn’t want to be glorified all of a sudden. “This is what we trained to
do,” she says. “This is what we do. That was true a year ago, and it will be true a year from
now.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Abundance of Caution (Gopnik, Montgomery)</strong></p>

    <p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/the-coronavirus-crisis-reveals-new-york-at-its-best-and-worst">New Yorker</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200327115706/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/the-coronavirus-crisis-reveals-new-york-at-its-best-and-worst">archived</a>), March 30, 2020</p>

    <p>Working patterns have changed over the past year, and if you live in a city, you might have
asked yourself what it is about cities that attracts and retains people despite there being no
requirement to live there anymore. This is a story that is still being written; cities <em>might</em>
well become less popular and end up as abandoned jungles of concrete-and-glass buildings with
empty offices. But there is very little indication that <em>that</em> is the direction we are headed
for. And so, when people return to cities from their present hiatuses (either from inside their
homes or from a completely different place), will the fabric that bound it together remain
unchanged? Or has it been damaged by the temporary abandonment? The message in this article is
pretty clear although it is not explicitly stated: <strong>When the rich-and-wealthy abandon the city
where they made their fortune, people notice.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Men Waiting for a Train (Biespiel)</strong></p>

    <p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/men-waiting-for-a-train">New Yorker</a> (<a href="https://archive.is/Np0re">archived</a>), 18th May, 2020</p>

    <p><strong>My High-School Commute (Jost)</strong></p>

    <p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/16/my-high-school-commute">New Yorker</a> (<a href="https://archive.ph/1MUxH">archived</a>), 16th March, 2020</p>

    <p>This article, written by SNL Weekend Update’s co-host Colin Jost, is about how the cities that
we grow up in are special to us simply because we were there during our formative years. I catch
myself waxing nostalgic about how great the city that I grew up in was, even though I never
really knew much more of it than the neighborhoods that my house and school were in. Stranger
still, I sometimes vehemently defend it against any attack from people who lived there as adults
and saw much more of its people and their idiosyncrasies. I doubt that this feeling will ever
change for me and this article helped me understand its roots.</p>

    <p><strong>Juul Finds Hell Hath No Fury Like an Army of Really Rich Parents (Etter)</strong></p>

    <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-05-14/teens-addicted-to-juul-flavor-pods-have-parents-furious-devil-s-playbook">Bloomberg Businessweek</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210610092201/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-05-14/teens-addicted-to-juul-flavor-pods-have-parents-furious-devil-s-playbook">archived</a>), 14th May, 2021</p>

    <p>The wealthy and the well-connected inhabit a world where social change comes from private
activities much more frequently than from the traditional route of dreary city council meetings
and convincing elected officials. This excerpt from a new book about the American company, Juul,
details the campaign against its “vaping products”, a cigarette-like product that emits white
smoke and delivers nicotine instead of cigarette’s mix of tobacco and nicotine, in one of
America’s wealthiest districts. In these parts, acquaintances from the upper deck seats of a
college football stadium can lead to increased pressure on a private company from its regulatory
body. Things get done, undoubtedly; whether the benefits of these changes will reach people
outside the wealthy parts is not their concern. This article reads like a thriller and introduces
a train of interesting characters, each armed with a roster of powerful connections.</p>

      <p>This is a change in format. I generally recommend only articles that are of medium length. I also don’t know much about poems, so I stay away from them for the most part. This poem was particularly impactful and evocative and thus, finds a place on this month’s list. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
