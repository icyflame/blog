  <p>This month’s theme is disorder, dishonesty and dysfunction. In that spirit, this month’s list
includes the story of a missionary dabbling in things that she should probably have stayed far away
from, the profile of a Trump administration operative who was an exceptionally bad manager and
irritated nearly everyone whom he worked with, a list of the winners of the recent absurdity in the
US stock markets and how it has helped those who got in early reap huge benefits by selling what
<em>basically</em> amounts to snake-oil, and, a contemporary historical study of how hot-button topics on
the Internet have evolved over the past 2 decades.</p>

    <p><strong>A Son’s Story (Zapana)</strong></p>

    <p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/13/texts-from-my-father-in-elmhurst-hospital">New Yorker</a> (<a href="https://archive.is/OUmKi">archived</a>), 13th April, 2020</p>

    <p>There is a terrible desensitization in the way that the newscasters switch from the number of
people who died yesterday to how a team won a sporting match without missing a beat or giving the
audience any time to recover from the previous story. A common argument for this is that people
can’t be bogged down by every bad story that they hear on the news because then they will be
unable to function; lest they be overwhelmed by the amount of bad things that are going on
simultaneously around the world, the audience must be protected through this <em>desensitization</em>,
some argue. This essay runs against the grain and tells the heart wrenching story of a death in
the family.</p>

    <p><strong>How Stephen Miller Manipulates Trump to Further His Immigration Obsession (Blitzer)</strong></p>

    <p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/02/how-stephen-miller-manipulates-donald-trump-to-further-his-immigration-obsession">New Yorker</a> (<a href="https://archive.ph/ATksn">archived</a>), 2nd March, 2020</p>

    <p>The former President of America, Donald Trump, had a “crazy clown posse” of henchmen and
assistants. Some of these people were people like John Bolton who had an agenda and were working
with Trump only because he was a tool to get that agenda done. Stephen Miller, on the other hand,
was a new animal who could exist <strong>only</strong> in the world where his boss was someone who did not <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-doesnt-read-and-skips-written-intelligence-report-unlike-past-presidents-802455">read
briefings</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/chaotic-west-wing-sidney-powell-donald-trump-68b9f15c-bf6d-46db-9cbb-4c9f47475985.html">allowed</a> meetings to turn into shouting matches. The part about Miller wanting
things to be done incredibly quickly, even if they were not done properly enough (legislatively)
to withstand future legal challenges and to last long, was an interesting real-world example of
why “move fast, break things” is a bad idea. His constant berating of the people that he met with
seems like a managerial tactic to avoid.</p>

    <p><strong>The SPAC King Is Doing Just Fine Even as the Bubble Starts to Burst (Faux)</strong></p>

    <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-05-13/spac-king-chamath-palihapitiya-hopes-his-hype-will-keep-mesmerizing-you">Bloomberg Businessweek</a> (<a href="https://archive.ph/cu10r">archived</a>), 17th May, 2021</p>

    <p>US stock markets have been <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME">crazy</a> in the past few months. One of the other weird bubbles that has
come up during that time has been the “Special Purpose Acquisition Company”, or “SPAC”,
bubble. Levine <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-06-04/bill-ackman-s-spac-will-be-three-spacs?sref=1kJVNqnU">explains</a> what they are and how they work. This article is about the SPAC king
“Chamath”, a megalomaniac, Elon Musk-type character who started appearing on everyone’s YouTube
feeds and gained a lot of popularity in early 2021 when he started saying things like “Venture
capitalists are conning everyone” and “Warren Buffet is not relevant, I am the new Buffet” and
became a folk hero to the <em>stonks</em> traders. I am not sure how he got all this attention in a
short period of time. He was one of the first few people to turn the SPAC concept into a bubble
which would mint money for anyone who “got in early”. This article is about how he has come out
on top, despite making deals with companies that have <em>questionable</em> viability and that almost
everyone else is losing money on.</p>

    <p><strong>The Mission (Levy)</strong></p>

    <p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/13/a-missionary-on-trial">New Yorker</a> (<a href="https://archive.ph/GAwZN">archived</a>), 6th April, 2020</p>

    <p>A fascinating recounting of the story of a woman who goes to Uganda and works as a missionary
there. She works in the health sector and begins treating people. But then, children suffering
from malnutrition start dying. Questions are asked about what she is doing and how she is so
closely connected to so many deaths. Her intentions appear to be good and it is impossible to
parse out what was really going on from this article. It is a good portrayal of the cutthroat
nature of communities of <em>do-gooders</em> in lower-income economics that seem to have personal enmity
and ego clashes in abundance.</p>

    <p><strong>Online Culture Wars (Alexander)</strong></p>

    <p><a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-online-culture">Astral Codex Ten</a> (<a href="https://archive.ph/nYUIb">archived</a>), 11th May, 2020</p>

    <p>The concept of a “culture war” has seeped into the mainstream now. There has been <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777">some</a>
discussion about how the conservative pundit leans on culture wars to generalize a single event
and taint how a religious or ethnic group is seen by the majority. There has also been <a href="https://observer.com/2016/02/the-totalitarian-doctrine-of-social-justice-warriors/">talk</a> about
how liberals wage culture wars against people by focusing on a wide variety of past oppression
and inter-sectional identities, ensuring that everyone is uncertain about whether they are the
oppressor or the oppressed in a given situation, and consequently, much to the liberals’ delight,
everyone is walking on eggshells. Neither of those positions is completely true or completely
false. It helps to look at the culture wars that have been waged on the Internet. Using some word
frequency plots and his general knowledge of the Internet blogosphere’s history, Alexander shows
that the extremely popular topics of a few years ago have been relegated to <em>lame</em> and
uninteresting (the “I am so rich I dress in leisurewear when I go to a high-end restaurant”
attitude).</p>
