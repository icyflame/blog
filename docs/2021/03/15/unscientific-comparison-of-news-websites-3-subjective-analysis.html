  <p>This series of posts looks at 13 news website home pages and compares them at a single point in time
based on the content that they choose to host and the presentation of that content to the common
user. This is the third post in this series and it looks subjectively at the <strong>look and feel</strong> of the
news articles on each news home page. As I explained in <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/news/journalism/media/critique/2021/03/13/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites-1-motivation-and-methodology/">the first post</a> in this series, this part of
the analysis is subjective and not based on any <span class="underline">standards</span>. I take a free-form “scoring” approach
to rank the website on some predefined characteristics and then compare those scores. If your
sensibilities do not match my own, this part of the analysis might not hold much value for you.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The clean design scoring definitely exposed something that I was vaguely expecting, but couldn’t
recognize until I had completed my scoring: It brought the sites I like the most to the top, with
some surprising exceptions in the final score.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites/graphs/subjective/1-sites-by-subjective-score.png" alt="img" /></p>

<h1 id="non-obscure-link-names-for-other-parts-of-the-site-are-important">Non-obscure link names for other parts of the site are important</h1>

<p>The surprising exception that came to the top was CNN. I don’t hold any strong opinions about CNN as
I don’t frequent the site very often. Looking at the screenshots again, I notice that the website
outdoes other websites in the “Useful links to other parts of the site” section. Vox loses on this
metric owing to the structure of Vox.com as a series of “verticals”, which are not very closely
related to news and can be more accurately described as “Special projects”. (e.g. the effective
altruism Vox vertical, Future Perfect).</p>

<p>The internet is powered by linking several other relevant pages on a highly trafficked page. This
increases the likelihood of people reaching the homepage through search and then going on to other
parts of the site that they find interesting. The Vox method of linking to obscure verticals is
sub-optimal from this point of view. On the other hand, smaller websites do this very
well. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a> does a very good job in leading people to other parts of the site. They have a
simple navigation bar with links that are <span class="underline">very</span> vanilla: Politics, Sports, Science, Podcasts,
Video. I have used this navigation bar several times, particularly when I want to listen to a
podcast or watch something that they recently put out, without any clear expectation of what topic
that might be related to. It is hard to argue that “Open Sourced”, “Recode”, “The Goods”, or “Future
Perfect” are easier to comprehend. The Print and The Wire, 2 Indian new-age news websites, do a good
job at this too, by sticking to traditional News beats for their navigation bar.</p>

<h1 id="most-of-the-websites-are-well-designed">Most of the websites are well designed</h1>

<p>This is controversial, because it is fashionable to rant about bad design and clutter. My experience
with these sites, with Ublock turned on, was pleasant. None of the websites took an inordinate
amount of time to load. The worst offenders were sites with moving elements like countdown timers or
interactive graphs that don’t add anything useful to the user’s experience. Bloomberg’s ticker is
the one element that I haven’t gotten used to despite having used the site for a while now. I am
tempted to say that I don’t think it adds value for any kind of user, professional stock broker or
otherwise, and that it is a <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/skeuomorphism">skeuomorphism-based</a> hold-out from the past when displays were too
expensive to be large enough to show several stock quotes at once.</p>

<p>News18 was the strangest website on this particular point. More on this later.</p>

<p>Hilariously, Republic World scored a 10/10 on “Clean design” because they chose to put a single
embedded video on their website (I was tempted to give them 11 or 15 for their surprising restraint
on this absolutely irrelevant point, even as their daily news coverage hovers somewhere between
“shouting match” and “I can’t believe this is news”). Of course, the website with the cleanest
design is one that is completely empty.</p>

<h1 id="non-news-ctas-are-bad-for-the-user">Non-news CTAs are bad for the user</h1>

<p>This one is a <span class="underline">no-brainer</span>. A news website shouldn’t mess with the reader’s experience with
unnecessary ads of campaigns that Indian TV news channels are major sponsors / participants of (NDTV
started this practice a few years ago with their “Save the Tiger” campaign which was widely
applauded by animal rights activists and became the <span class="underline">vogue</span> thing to do if you are a news channel
with a meaningful audience). Most of the websites I looked at have the “Subscribe” CTA. Given that
these websites have very few avenues of making money if most of their users have ad-blockers
installed, this is a necessary evil and must be forgiven by the responsible consumer.</p>

<p>As for links to Twitter / Facebook / foobarbaz, I doubt that these are required. I can find CNN on
Twitter. If I want to mention NDTV on Twitter, I will type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@NDTV</code> and select the first suggestion
from Twitter that has the verified check mark. I think most other users will do the same. I doubt
that any Twitter user will go from NDTV.com to Twitter.com/NDTV and then tap on the Tweet button. My
intuition is that at some point in the past, product managers of the NDTV.com website decided to add
these CTAs to their site and that they didn’t run A/B tests to see if these new CTAs drove any
engagement. Removing code is harder than adding it into a large repository, because anything that is
in the repository quickly used in unexpected ways by other developers. This probably
dis-incentivised them from removing these CTAs later (This is all rank speculation, pay no mind to
it).</p>

<p>At last, we come to News18. This is the part of the analysis where I slightly started to lose my
patience because News18.com is just not a good place to read anything. It faired poorly in the
objective analysis because there was a lot of Clickbait and a lot of Entertainment news. Apart from
the News articles, the site has nearly 10 other CTAs. These say things like “Watch Live TV”,
“Download News18 App” (inexplicably shown on a desktop browser), “Follow” the site on social media
etc. There’s also some sort of campaign that is asking you to take a pledge to save water
today. There’s a <span class="underline">strange</span> “COVID tracker” where the word “COVID” is replaced by a rendering of the
many-pronged “virus”. I seriously hope that you never have to tap on any link that leads you to this
homepage, as one can only get more confused from the barrage of irrelevant information that’s
presented on it.</p>
