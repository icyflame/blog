  <p>This has been a pretty good year for my blog, I think(??). Of course, the
metrics that I use are rather subjective and might not bear even a semblance to
the truth. In my head, 2017’s quick recap would definitely feature these things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I started
  <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/tag/#100daysofwriting">100DaysOfWriting</a> on
  the 18th of February. That was also my first post on the blog in 2017, and
  in almost a year!</li>
  <li><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html">SHA-1 was broken</a>
  for the first time with some binary padding data, two PDFs had the same
  SHA-1 even though they were different!</li>
  <li>I watched a little bit of Veep, but then gave up after the 4th season! Selena
  was just about to become president. I wish I could continue where I left
  off, unfortunately, it’s too late for that now.</li>
  <li>My <a href="https://public-inbox.org/git/xmqqinjnhcr8.fsf@gitster.mtv.corp.google.com/">git patch was ejected</a>
 (not merged into master), but the patch made it as far as pu.
  I had a really good time reading the code that powers so much
  of software today. It was fun, I will pick it up again
  sometime in the next year.</li>
  <li>I updated from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/writing/ubuntu/installation/2017/03/04/day-15/">16.04 LTS</a>
After a nerve wracking few hours of guess work, I was able to get encrypted
ext4 partitions to work! (+ <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/programming/ubuntu/installation/setup/2017/03/05/day-16/">auto-mounting on start-up</a></li>
  <li>I watched and absolutely loved Big Little Lies S1. Season 2 is going to be
  absolutely epic!</li>
  <li>Homeland’s 6th Season lived upto the mark and then some. Quinn’s resurrection
  is on the cards, I hope</li>
  <li>Cloudfare faced Cloudbleed and the buffer overflow error reared it’s head once
  more! Thankfully, GoLang is here to solve all the problems. (Right?!)</li>
  <li>I struggled with a weird bug on Ubuntu where my mouse would simply stop
  working now and again. I am still facing this bug, but it has reduced to
  a much more acceptable number of occurences. The <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/writing/technology/problems/problem-solving/2017/03/25/day-36/">modprobe fix</a>
  works for now.</li>
  <li>I started reading Austen! I read Emma, Sense and Sensibility and
  Persuasion. Her other three novels are on deck for next year.</li>
  <li>Handmaid’s Tale (Atwood) took the spot of “The Dystopia I fear most”,
  displacing 1984.</li>
  <li>Demonetisation was an eerie reminder of the power that the
  state wields in this country</li>
  <li>The internet came together on r/place and did something to a canvas that
  boggled everyone’s mind and captured my imagination. Oh, I LOVE the
  Internet!</li>
  <li>I re-watched about 10 seasons worth of Seinfeld. I am not exagerrating.</li>
  <li>United Airlines dragged a passenger through the cabin and everyone was
  hysteric about it. Ended up reading <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/airplanes/books/2017/05/14/day-86/">a book written by a flight attendant</a>
  and developing a lot of empathy</li>
  <li>I taped my webcam, updated my RSA keys to 4096 bits and enabled ufw to close
  all ports, all the time. Go Privacy!</li>
  <li>I found the <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/nautilus/missed/rant/ubuntu/update/open-mic/comedy/2017/04/14/day-56/">Nautilus update irritating</a>
  but didn’t switch and am now quite happy about it!</li>
  <li>I watched Masaan, Lunchbox, Contagion, and Another Earth for the umpteenth
  time</li>
  <li>I interned at <a href="http://elanic.in/">Elanic</a> for 2 months! I learned a lot and
  it helped me <em>get</em> Node.js!</li>
  <li>WannaCry happened, MalwareTechBlog stopped it, then MalwareTechBlog got stuck
  in the US (and is still there!)</li>
  <li>I <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/chrome/browsers/twitter/2017/05/11/day-83/">stayed with Chrome</a>
and then, switched to Quantum two days after it released. Quantum is the best
browser I have ever used in my life till now!</li>
  <li>I had a tweet blow up (to some extent).
  <a href="https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/862524711980285953/"><img src="/public/img/2017-05-11-twitter.png" alt="twitter-screenshot" /></a></li>
  <li>I was stranded in
  <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/nature/floods/bangalore/2017/05/26/day-98/">Koramangala</a>
  for a couple hours and then we waded through a feet of water at around 1 am to get home!</li>
  <li>I started listening to
  <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/writing/books/2017/06/01/an-update/">Podcasts</a>
  and I haven’t been able to go back to my way of life before. They are only
  getting better and more popular, so that’s one of the good things that
  happened this year!</li>
  <li>I watched the 19 episodes of My So Called Life! That show <strong>did not</strong> deserve
  to be cancelled right in the middle of a season</li>
  <li>I watched 2 seasons of Downton Abbey and I am absolutely in love with Sybil’s
  character</li>
  <li>I read parts the TLS 1.2 RFC and <a href="https://www.siddharthkannan.in/tls-handshake/">wrote an overview</a>.
Considering that this came in handy in an interview I had later this year,
this has been a very worthwhile use of time. Much more so than I had
anticipated it at the
<a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/internet/tls/security/https/2017/06/13/understanding-tls/">beginning</a></li>
  <li>I spent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_Puja">Durga Pujo</a> in Kolkata and
  saw first-hand how chaotic a city can be!</li>
  <li>I raved about <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/npm/api/goofs/software/2017/10/08/npm-downloads-api-change/">NPM’s abrupt change to their download-stats API</a>
  which got <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/750887/npm_changes_downloads_api_and_informs_the_world/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link">some attention</a></li>
  <li>I obsessed over <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/tag/#primer">Primer (2004)</a>
  and managed to untangle most of the mysteries. This is going right up there
  on the shelf of my favourite movies of all time.</li>
  <li>I watched Arrival and fell in love with time travel, aliens, Amy Adams,
  science and language. All over again!</li>
</ul>

<p>And here we are. 1st January, 2018.</p>

<p><strong>P.S</strong> This post ended up using the pronoun “I” a lot more than I expected it
to. I didn’t know how to phrase what I wanted to say appropriately without doing
that. The excessive usage does make me uncomfortable, but I guess it can’t be
avoided. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=633rwYgYJDs">Casey Neistat</a> did the
same thing when he made a review video. His videos are SO GOOD.</p>
