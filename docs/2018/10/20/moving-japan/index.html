  <p><a href="https://www.mercari.com/about/"><img src="/public/img/mercari-logo.png" alt="mercari" /></a></p>

<p>So, it’s been a long time since I talked about what’s going on in my life. I
moved to Tokyo in September. I came here in the third week of September and
started working at Mercari from the 1st week of October.</p>

<p>Mercari is a C2C marketplace (mainly for second hand goods) in Japan. There’s a
Mercari product in the US and UK as well. I got the job in IIT Kharagpur’s
placements in December 2017. Yes, I have been fairly silent on this blog and
everywhere else about the job; primarily because there were a lot of things that
needed to all go well for me to actually start working here. Getting the visa
was one of the main components of that.</p>

<p>In the end, things did turn out well! The visa part of the process actually
ended up being the least stressful! It’s rather incredible when professionals
are planning your trip to a country, compared to when you have to do all the
planning yourself! (In fact, at the Indian immigration counter, I was asked just
one question: “What is the purpose of your visit?”!)</p>

<p>Now, it’s been three weeks since I joined Mercari. I have finally been assigned
to a team. I don’t have an assignment just yet; I need to be on-boarded onto the
team I am on before I get that. The combination of infrastructure and third
party services that Mercari uses is mind-bloggingly HUGE! My closest experience
to this was at Elanic where we had a single Digital Ocean server with a docker
container for the API and MongoDB and some other containers. We had a dev
environment that could pretty much be setup on your computer after building a
few docker images. So, this is pretty overwhelming right now.</p>

<p>I will probably get more used to it as I run into the potholes that people
generally run into when they are being on-boarded into a new team. I am also
looking forward to working on something that is being used by 100s of thousands
of people! That’s also something I haven’t done before. The gist: A lot of
firsts here!</p>

<p>Apart from work, just the experience of living in Japan has been great! It’s a
lot of things, but if I was forced to condense all of that into a single word,
it would be: <strong>CONVENIENT</strong>. Stores and restaurants are open 24 hours; The
subway runs late; You can get anywhere in Tokyo after a short train ride; The
food has very little in the way of things that are bad for your health: oil,
spices. Of course, the last thing about food can be a con for people who <em>like</em>
oily, spicy food!</p>

<p>A huge reason for moving here, for me, was to experience living in a foreign
country! Food forms a big part of that and I am only getting started on trying
Japanese food. I have tried Sushi, Ramen, Soba and Teishoku meals in a variety
of places with a variety of items in them till now. I definitely want to get
used to Japanese food! I love everything I have tried till now, that’s certainly
<em>VERY</em> encouraging!</p>

<p>As I continue to settle in here, I will keep making blog posts about the things
I used to write about before. There might be more content that’s Japan-related
too though, I don’t think I can quite help that!</p>
