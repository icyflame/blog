  <p><em>This is part 1 of a two part series</em></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/news/series/2018/07/30/news-media-expectations-1/">Part 1</a> · <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/news/series/2018/08/17/news-media-expectations-2/">Part 2</a></p>

<p>I am fresh off the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness">Factfulness</a> dose. The authors articulate one thing about
the news media:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I cannot even see the highest-quality news outlets conveying a neutral and
non-dramatic representative picture of the world, as statistics agencies do. It
would be correct but just too boring. We shouldn't expect the media to move very
far in that direction. Instead it is up to us as consumers to learn how to
consume the news more factfully, and to realize that the news is not very useful
for understanding the world
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This got me to thinking about how much I have complained about the Indian news
media in the past: the unnecessary sensationalization of stories, the shouting,
the talking head shows that run throughout the day with a macho news anchor who
is shouting the populist opinion (whatever that might be), generalizations. I
realized that they were pandering to every single instinct mentioned in
Factfulness. A quick summary:</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/news-media-11.jpg" alt="img" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>The gap enables the <em>powerful</em> people to hide information and fool the
majority of people who are not powerful</li>
  <li><em>Negative</em> news stories only: deaths, harassment, lynchings, bans</li>
  <li>3 bad things happened last month? Expect 6 more this month, 9 the next month
and so on! Things will only go downhill from here!</li>
  <li><em>Be afraid</em> of the powerful people and the authority figures because you
might be the next victim. Don’t let them tell you how to live.</li>
  <li><em>Blow</em> things <em>wayyyy</em> out of proportion</li>
  <li>Generalize everything across state identities, religions, nationalities,
communities</li>
  <li>Bad things happen in this state or the other and have for years, it’s stupid
to expect change from the people in power because they want to maintain the
status quo</li>
  <li>There’s only one view of every single story: the news anchor’s view</li>
  <li><em>Blame</em> the first person who is accussed and conduct a media trial
immediately and declare that the person is guilty</li>
  <li><em>You MUST ACT NOW!</em> Tweet us, use this hashtag, sms us, call in and express
your opinions, do it <em>RIGHT NOW!</em>, where else will you be heard! Time is
flying by as is obvious from the 10 moving elements on your TV screen.</li>
</ol>

<p>Next time you watch a nightly news show on Indian TV, look out for these
instincts. You will find them.</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> a rant. I am not blaming anyone here. I have done what’s in my
power: I have stopped watching these news shows. I have told every single person
who says they watch these programs about how they are run, about why they should
stop watching these programs and instead read or watch videos on YouTube. If
they are still interested in news, videos by channels like Vox and Vice News. If
not, there are enough cat videos to fill your heart to the brim.</p>

<p><strong>Truth:</strong> There are always enough cat videos.</p>

<p>The news business runs on advertisements. Shows that get eyeballs, get ads and
make money. Every segment should keep the viewer glued to the screen, it should
make them want more, it should ensure that they don’t reach for that remote. So,
the first thing we need to do is to stop blaming news channels for the things
they choose to run. It’s what the consumers watch, it’s what they get ads for.
It’s not their fault, it’s the business model.</p>

<p>It’s like that Zach Holman talk[FN1] about the HR department in every company. The HR
department works keeping the company’s interests in mind. Similarly, the news
media works keeping the advertisers interests in mind, not the consumers. As
soon as you understand that, you can start correcting for it. You can understand
why a particular story is being run. You can understand the other side of the
story, what the news producer was thinking when they approved the script for the
opening lines by the news anchor.</p>

<p>Now, the YouTube channels. I can vouch for only two: Vox and Vice News. They put
out videos that help you <em>understand the world</em>. The content that Vox puts out
is amazing! It’s backed by facts and is solid to the core. There is no
sensationalism. There are no unnecessary graphics, in fact, the graphics are
kept to the absolute minimum. The graphics help you understand the video and
don’t distract you. Vox doesn’t ask you to tweet to them, to use a hashtag. They
don’t ask you to do something, they simply explain the things that are. What’s
the advantages that YouTube has over TV?</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>People don’t <em>have</em> to watch:</strong> They have a lot of content to choose from. TV
on the other hand is limited. During prime time, 9 pm to 10 pm, all Tamil TV
channels run bad reality shows. If you are not into sports and don’t want to
watch a movie along with your dinner, your only option are news channels.</li>
  <li><strong>There is no primetime:</strong> Your content is out there, forever. It can be
watched all over the world. It can be reviewed, people can call you out if
you made a mistake. The bad part is that the people who watch your videos
will also see your mistake. But TV doesn’t support criticism. You would have
to criticise a TV show on the Internet and how many people who watch a show
will see your YouTube video or blog post especially if you are just a normal
guy?</li>
  <li><strong>Ad revenue is directly tied to the number of people who watch your
content:</strong> On TV, it’s not the number of people who watch but the rating of
your TV show. As the TV regulatory agency put it very well in a report I read
and analyzed on this blog a few weeks ago, ratings decide the content that
gets made and ratings are collected from a sample of the population. No one
can measure exactly how many people really watched a show. They can only
measure how many people in the sample watched that particular show. These are
the numbers that big companies who want to run ads on these shows get. On
YouTube, you get the exact number of people who watched every single video.
The demographics of each video’s viewers, the country that the video is
popular in, and so on! All of this extra information is a boon for
advertisers who can target exactly the people they want. So, channels like
Vox must make a huge variety of high quality content. That’s the reason there
are so many types of Vox videos: Almanac, Atlas, the series about Pop
culture, the series about things that are hyped up, the amazing Emmy
nominated Vox Borders!</li>
  <li><strong>Diverse and prolonged viewership:</strong> TV shows are available for one hour a
day to 1 billion people. There are no re-runs of talking head shows, there is
no value in re-running them because the information that they were trying to
dissipate is old the minute after the show aired for the first time.
Producers don’t have to make the show re-watchable, they just have to make
the show sensational enough to make people watch it once. And not “people”,
just the people who are part of the sample which contributes to the ratings.
I don’t think there’s any way to actually influence the sample but not
everyone else, still, it’s one less thing to worry about. Vox video producers
on the other hand have to worry about making the video watchable, shareable.
There is nothing better than a personal, trusted recommendation. They have to
make the video good enough to stick around forever and be re-watchable by a
ton of people around the world. That’s why most Vox videos have closed
captions in a few languages, that’s why the voice over is never messy or
unclear, that’s why the graphics are never distracting. (That is my
assumption)</li>
</ol>

<p>Said in a sentence: <em>Businesses do what they have to do to excel at their
business model</em>. Both TV shows and YouTube content creators need to get as many
eyeballs as they can. But the set of constraints is different. TV shows need to
be appealing for a short period of time, they needn’t have re-watch value, and
they need to attract the people in the TRP sample. YouTube content creators need
to make content that’s worth watching atleast once and preferably several times,
the content should be shareable and should reflect the type of all content on
that channel, it should be true because people can call you out on your mistakes
and your viewers are right there watching out for such call outs. They each work
to excel at their business model.</p>

<p><em>This was part 1 of a 2 part series on Media and Expectations - TV v. Internet</em></p>

<p>Part 2 will cover a particular case of Factfulness. A short synopsis:</p>

<p>Most Indians will remember the stories about train derailments during the months
of May 2017 to August 2017, there were nearly 9 accidents. There was a huge
uproar on the over-use of Indian Railways infrastructure and several thousands
of column inches and TV show hours were spent debating and discussing this. The
problem with each show was the same, they presented one number: the number of
accidens, deaths and injuries that had happened in the past 3 months. There was
no number to compare it to. In part 2, I will try to figure out what the numbers
really are and then compare them to older numbers. I picked this problem at
random because it affected the way I think about the safety of trains. I don’t
know what the outcome will be yet, I am still collating data. Either way, I
think it will be a worthwhile experience.</p>

<p><strong>FN1:</strong> The talk is called <em>Getting Fired</em> and it’s a great way to spend 45
minutes of your time.</p>
