  <p><strong>Update:</strong> I didn’t really end up doing this internship because on January 12, 2016, TinyOwl revoked
the internship offers that it had made to 7 people in IIT Kharagpur due to internal turmoil. I don’t have
the heart to remove this post because this is exactly how I felt at the end of the interview, and I want
this to be out there for other people searching about TinyOwl.</p>

<p><a href="http://tinyowl.com/"><img src="/public/img/tinyowl.jpg" alt="tinyowl-logo" /></a></p>

<p>So, this post is long overdue. On 30th August, 2015, TinyOwl visited IIT Kharagpur to recruit interns for their internship program, during the months of May-July, 2016.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed when I saw their intenship notification form on the ERP, was that they used Ruby on Rails! That got me excited. To top it off, there were some more things that I was totally excited about. They used Grunt, Bower, Yeoman, and that’s it. I was sold! I had to apply for this company.</p>

<p>It was the first non-core web-dev-related company that had opened for Mechanical Engineering. And I was excited about it right from the moment I submitted the CV. Before submitting, I sent the CV to <a href="http://github.com/prudhvid">@prudhvid</a>, <a href="http://github.com/ankeshanand">@ankeshanand</a> and <a href="http://github.com/light94">@light94</a> to get it proofread and corrected, and they gave some really awesome suggestions. Spending some more time tweaking the LaTeX file and finally, I was ready to submit.</p>

<p>I submitted the CV and waited. I had no idea that they were going to conduct an online coding round. In fact, I found out about the test at 1730, around 1733, when I recieved an email from HackerRank, which was the platform they were using to conduct this test.</p>

<p>I rushed to the CIC, as that was where we were supposed to give this test. I reached around 15 minutes late, but as it was a time-bound test, and HackerRank itself took care of the total time given to each candidate, there wasn’t much of an issue there. I sat down and started the test, and there was only one question. Hmm, taken aback slightly.</p>

<p>The question was to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Find the number of k-subsequences from an n-array whose sum was divisble by the integer k</code>. Integers <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> were given in the problem. The data acquistion from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdin</code> was already done in the solution, we just had to fill out the function that found the number.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was fill out the function with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O(2^n)</code> solution, that was linear in memory (I think). I didn’t expect it to clear more than 2 testcases, but surprisingly it cleared 4 of them before the other testcases started timing out.</p>

<p>I had to search for a more time-intensive solution. I tried a lot of approaches for an hour, and had to finally submit a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O(n^3)</code> solution that was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n^2</code> in memory. It cleared only 2 test cases, but it was far better on time. (Other test cases were running out of memory.) So, I submitted the code. I later found out that I should have submitted the earlier code that passed 4 test cases, as that’s the metric used by most companies while evaluating such tests.</p>

<p>After all of this, I waited. Come saturday night, and the shortlist was released. 23 people were selected for hte Personal Interview. Come sunday, and about 12-14 hours from 8 in the morning to 8 at night, (most of the time involving waiting for my turn), I had given one interview.</p>

<p>The list was finally officially released around 2230 that night, and hell yeah, I was happy.</p>

<p>Perhaps the part that excites me even more about this internship, is that I am going to go back to Mumbai after two long long years! Yay! :D</p>

<p>And of course, per tradition, I posted about this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kannan.siddharth/posts/928403613901748">on Facebook</a>, the next night!</p>
