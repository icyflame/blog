  <p>In yesterday’s post (which I posted about an hour ago), I said that I was going
to figure out how GnuCash worked. I made short work of that, and I have ended up
learning what the basics of Double Entry Bookkeeping are:</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqAaScYVeRQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The whole software makes a lot of sense now. I have setup the initial entry to
get started with the expense stuff (I like the report feature, hopefully I
should be able to generate some meaningful reports in a few months).</p>

<p>I think it’s finally time to talk about the Homeland Season 6 finale. Yeah, I
should get this out of the way.</p>

<h2 id="major-spoilers-ahead-dont-continue-if-you-ever-plan-to-watch-homeland">MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD; DON’T CONTINUE IF YOU EVER PLAN TO WATCH HOMELAND</h2>

<p>There’s a reason that spoiler notice is in HUGE font, I have often seen people
disregard that and I have been tempted to disregard it often. The couple times
that I did do it, I tried really really hard to forget the spoiler, which only
ended up solidifying the spoiler in my head. (Eventually, I ended up not
watching the thing and waiting for about 6 months or something and then coming
back to watch it, that way the spoiler even if remembered comes to my mind only
at a much later stage)</p>

<p>So, Quinn dies. Saul lives. Keane lives and when Dar Adal says “There’s
something off about her”, he was SO RIGHT. Keane has basically started her war
against the intelligence community. The stage for this whole thing starts with a
plot to assasinate Keane that is foiled by Carrie’s weird intuition and a phone
call from guess who? DAR ADAL. This one dialogue stuck in my head:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Carrie: Quinn? Are you seeing this they are evacuating the hotel. Quinn?
Dar: This isn’t Quinn, Carrie. What’s going on?
Carrie: Fuck you, Dar
Dar: Listen to me, and listen very carefully. The President-elect’s life is in
danger … Under no circumstances, allow her motorcade to leave the hotel. Do
you hear me?
Carrie: Why not?
Dar: <strong>Because that hotel has been vetted for months. Swept thoroughly and
repeatedly. The bomb-scare is a ruse to get her out on the street</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eventually, Carrie does stop the motorcade and Keane is saved. Quinn has to lay
down his life to save Keane. Quinn dies. It was a SAD SAD MOMENT. Rupert Friend
played one of the best characters in this show, from the first scene that Quinn
walks in on Carrie during a mission (Dar sends him) and Carrie thinks he’s there
spying for Dar and he helps her out. From then till his last scene, not once did
he let Carrie down. The shootout where there are three people in the car with
the mole inside the embassy, Quinn comes through for her. Carrie then stays back
and searches for Quinn and figures out where he is.</p>

<p>TL; DR Quinn was my favourite character, has been for the past two seasons.
Carrie is the lead character, so her being a favourite is no surprise. Quinn
though. Oh, QUINN.</p>

<p>After a six week jump, Carrie is still working for the president and is some
kind of a liason between the President and the intelligence community. O’Keefe
still continues his rhetoric (which is infuriating but you know he’s not going
to change and he doesn’t do much damage, so let him rant). Max and Carrie cry in
the heartbreaking scene where they look at the photos that Quinn has. There’s a
smiling picture of Carrie in them along with his son’s photos.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/day-57-1.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>I wish they would give him some sort of a prequel episode where he is with the
mother of his son and how they came about to be together and what he did that
separated them. I wish they would bring Rupert Friend back, even if it is just
for a cameo in one episode in season 7. I would say there’s a non-trivial chance
of them doing it because Quinn has quickly risen to become one of the most
beloved characters across the Internet. (Not to mention #EmmyForRupert)</p>

<p>All in all, this season has been one of the best TV show renewals. They have
definitely recreated the magic, suspense, the thriller in the plot that was
there in Seasons 1 and 2. At the same time, they have managed to provide the
PERFECT setup for the next season with Keane going all rogue and imprisoning
Saul (Dar was already in prison). HELL YEAH!</p>
