        <p>Here’s the <strong>noble lie</strong> about democracy: The electorate holds the ruling party accountable for their
actions during the next election. This is taught in classrooms and in political science courses; it
is drilled into the minds of children who have the good fortune of growing up in a liberal
democracy. The truth is revealed when they realize that the electorate is unwilling or unable to
hold the ruling party accountable and that the ruling party is able to entice the electorate with
populist schemes that are announced <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-government-announces-gold-loan-waiver-hours-before-poll-dates-2379180">hours before campaigning begins</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. There is a tedious and
disheartening conversation about why no country has realized this ideal state of democracy in
practice or been able to stay in that state for a long period of time; a conversation that would
identify the media, political self-interest and capitalism as a few of the causes. This post does
<strong>not</strong> engage in that conversation. Instead, I focus on a core component of this system which would
hold the noble lie up: <strong>Access</strong> to public services such as education, healthcare, and a competent
local government. I contend that widening access is the <strong>silver bullet</strong> which will allow countries
to reach the ideal state of democracy and maintain that state in the long term.</p>

        <p>Anna Karenina is a love story. Reading this book has shown me the source of several scenes from
iconic romantic movies: Lovers meeting in a railway station, rejection at dinners, and heartbroken
characters traveling abroad attempting to heal their soul. Tolstoy’s descriptions of people and
their interactions with each other were more compelling to me than his descriptions of natural
scenes. This preference is probably related to my (current) personal preference for stories which
have interesting characters doing unpredictable things.</p>

        <p>This month, we deal with the recent past. The recommendations include the profile of a digital
marketer, which looks back at how Trump’s 2016 campaign used the tools at their disposal effectively
to achieve something the <em>mainstream</em> strongly believed was impossible, an article about the
disastrous effects of healthcare systems being optimized for efficiency and the steps we can take to
avoid them, and how loneliness might be one of those truly new and modern problems which time
travelers would be unable to explain to their relatively temporally close counterparts in the late
1700s.</p>

        <p>“The night is dark and full of terrors” - Parents use phrases like these to put children to sleep
and to curb their adorable natures and their inexhaustible reserves of energy, which enable them to
run around, squealing in delight, until all hours of the night. On exiting childhood, most people
discover the deception that their parents had engaged in. The second years living in the Nehru Hall
at IIT Kharagpur had a remarkable experience: For them, the terrors returned and their parents were
proved right. They were woken up at odd hours of the night, requested to demonstrate the skills they
had learned in the <a href="/iit-kgp/india/orientation-program/2021/05/11/orientation-program-iit-kharagpur-part-2/">common room</a> and the <a href="/iit-kgp/india/orientation-program/2021/05/12/orientation-program-iit-kharagpur-part-3/">dining hall</a> and subject to a series of deranged
meditations. These polite requests were unlike those that some might be accustomed to, as they were
made by third-, fourth- and fifth-years who stood in the first-floor corridor and directed their
voices downwards towards throngs of second-years who stood in neat rows on the playground. <strong>This</strong>
was the final form that hazing at IIT Kharagpur, affectionately referred to by the euphemism,
“Orientation Program”, or simply, O.P, assumed. I recount my experience of O.P. in this 4-part
series. This is the fourth and final part, The Midnight Assemblies.</p>

        <p>Food holds a special importance in everyday life. A lot of memories are connected to it and
apparently <a href="https://archive.ph/UH8oH#selection-859.33-859.86">the most important word</a> in French is the word for the afternoon snack.  In IIT
Kharagpur’s Nehru Hall, there were no such pretensions about food; but a strange reverence was shown
to the place where food was often eaten, the mess hall. The single most important phrase in this
hallowed ground was “Excuse Me”, the over-used English phrase most often heard in Victorian dramas
when heroines flustered by their love interest utter these words and an escape hatch is opened to
them. Second-years were implored: when you are done eating your food and are stepping away from the
table, you <em>must</em> cast this magical incantation. Once cast, the spell worked wonders as it
suppressed the bout of shouting and mocking from third-, fourth- and fifth-years. Curiously,
everyone in the third-year and above inside the same dining hall was exempt from this <em>rule</em>. As in
Pride and Prejudice, another Victorian-era drama, the female characters who are being married off
have little say in whom they are married to, while the men have all the choice that they could
possibly want; so in Nehru Hall, second years had to follow a lot of rules designed to keep them
“humble and respectful”, while everyone else lead rule-free lives. <strong>This</strong> dichotomy was a part of
hazing at IIT Kharagpur, affectionately referred to by the euphemism, “Orientation Program”, or
simply, O.P. I recount my experience of O.P. in this 4-part series. This is the third part,
Victorian-era Dining Hall Etiquette.</p>

        <p>As a second year student at IIT Kharagpur, the 2.5 months between July and September 2014 were
uneventful at Nehru Hall, one of several hostels inside the campus. Then, things took a turn. While
I believe that it was for the better, the voice at the back of my head believes it was for the
worse. In this post, I relate the story of a sermon that was delivered in the common room of my
hostel. The sermon in question was about the art of introducing oneself to a group of
strangers. While many might naively believe that they have mastered this art, this sermon will open
your eyes (as it did mine) to the <em>right</em> manner of making a first impression. <strong>This</strong> was an
integral part of hazing at IIT Kharagpur, affectionately referred to by the euphemism, “Orientation
Program”, or simply, O.P. I recount my experience in this 4-part series. This is the second part,
The Sermon in the Common Room.</p>

        <p>At the end of my first year at IIT Kharagpur, an engineering college in India, I packed up
everything I owned into cardboard boxes, put them in the common room of my hostel and went back to
my parent’s home for the summer vacation. 2 months later, in the second week of July 2014, I
returned to my new hostel, Nehru Hall. I found that my room had not been vacated yet and was not
ready for “check-in”. <strong>This</strong> was the beginning of hazing at IIT Kharagpur, affectionately referred
to by the euphemism, “Orientation Program” or simply, O.P. I recount my experience of O.P in this
4-part series. This is the first part, The Curious Case of the Dweller Who Wouldn’t Move Out.</p>

        <p>Journalism is the act of taking facts and expert opinions, putting them together with the context
required to make them meaningful, and producing a piece that consumers will learn <em>something</em>
from<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This is the basic framework I use to understand and evaluate news
organizations. <a href="https://www.Newslaundry.com/">Newslaundry</a> is an Indian subscription-based independent news organization that I
started following with the hope that their “indie music” approach to journalism was the refreshing
breeze that Indian news media desperately <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK7y3OsKQzY">needs</a>. My findings were disappointing, a recent episode of
their daily news briefing podcast had a story which was read out with none of the required
context. This symbolizes the problems media organizations face and have left unresolved. I will
continue to read the work that Newslaundry produces, albeit with lowered expectations when compared
to what I have for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/">NHK</a> or <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg</a>.</p>

consequences of the intersection of a dance form and a journey of self-discovery is at the top of
the list. Also, there’s an article about pandemics (everyone’s <em>favorite</em> topic since Jan 2020) and
a profile of the author of a book that I did not like.</p>

  <p>The point of hazing is to make the victims of the hazing want to haze the next class of victims

<p>This got me thinking about my experience with bullying during childhood and hazing in college. I
turned out “okay”: I escaped the worst of it by laying low. I laughed at the parts that I
found hilarious. I ridiculed the people who were hazing me. I looked around and found (rather
easily) some of their peers, who also ridiculed them and were incomparably <span class="underline">better</span> than them (in my
estimation). I endured what I could find no way out of. And I enabled the subsequent classes of
victims to escape it.</p>

<p>On graduating college and entering a new phase of my life, old bonds where cherished and new
friendships were formed; belonging was felt and people <span class="underline">cared</span>. With the benefit of hindsight, I
consider the question of hazing once more.</p>
