  <p>This post might be about 20 days late, but it sure is packed with some of the
best stuff that I heard in the last month. There’s a lot of foreign policy and
politics related stuff this month.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Impact</strong> - <strong>Plane Crash hospitals vs. Car Crash hospitals</strong> <strong>5/5</strong></p>

    <p>This episode is about how every single plane crash automatically starts an
  investigation. The investigation eventually leads to a diagnosis of what
  went wrong.  Using this diagnosis, the check lists are updated, new
  processes are introduced to ensure that the chances of the same problem
  causing another accident goes down signficantly. Whereas, car crashes are
  rampant and happen every single day. No investigations are done, and it
  doesn’t seem like the situation is improving. <strong>What happens when a hospital
  applies the Plane crash principal to solve a problem that they realize is
  too big?</strong> It has a lot of subtle points about authority, ego, and how a
  change in a process, inside any institution, can’t be overnight even if it
  has provably better results.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Impact</strong> - <strong>The Opiod Crisis</strong></p>

    <p>There are several podcasts out there about the Opiod crisis in the US right
  now. It’s a very country specific problem and is apparently on the rise in
  Europe too. What I find interesting in this problem is how rampant it has
  gotten before it attracted government attention. How the problem started
  itself is a textbook process of a bunch of sketchy pharma industry people
  getting together and deciding to start a “brain washing” campaign for
  doctors - with all expense paid trips to conferences where they are subtly
  told about how they should treat pain more aggressively. <strong>The Daily</strong> did a
  2 part series on the people behind the first pharma company that realized
  there was an opportunity here and how despite so many years of
  investigations into this, the people at the top escaped unscathed. <strong>A
  riveting story of how corporate obligations can be met without doing any
  good for society as a whole.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Daily</strong> - <strong>What the West got wrong about China, parts 1 and 2</strong> <strong>5/5</strong></p>

    <p>Another really informative series about the basic assumptions about China
  that the West got wrong: a restricted economy would never prosper. The West
  has always had this obsession with the axiom that “Democracy is the only
  system that succeeds” and now, more and more countries are threatening to
  prove that axiom wrong. As scary as that is, analyzing how exactly this
  happened is probably our best way forward. Another very interesting part of
  the series is where everyone believed that once the Internet becomes more
  popular, it will be impossible for the Chinese government to curb dissent.
  Of course, The Great Firewall came up and instead of the Internet being a
  liberating tool, it was used by the government to spread propaganda!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Daily</strong> - <strong>What Facebook knew and tried to hide</strong></p>

    <p>A short introduction to the decision making process in conglomerates as big
  as Facebook where one person never holds the key and one person can never
  comprehend the size of the operation. The story is framed as some sort of an
  ideological battle between Zuckerberg and Sandberg. I am not sure where that
  comes from, but it definitely casts Zuckerberg in the same light as the
  Social Network movie - the college student who is very brainy but <em>still</em>
  doesn’t understand the business behind Facebook. I think that is
  far-fetched, but nonetheless, this is an interesting listen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Everything is Alive</strong> - <strong>Ana, the Elevator</strong></p>

    <p>A new podcast where the host interviews someone playing an inanimate part of
  our lives. It’s weird and <em>cooookie</em> to begin with, but it definitely grows
  on you. This episode was interesting to me because I recently started
  working in a building where there are about 60 elevators split over 5
  elevator lobbies. These elevators are going up and down <em>every</em> second of
  the day, ever since they were installed. And they are privy to so much of
  the people in that building’s habits and conversations. (Not too many
  conversations because Japanese manners <em>frown</em> on talking in public places -
  trains, elevators)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Everything is Alive</strong> - <strong>Tara, the Bar of soap</strong></p>

    <p>My interest in this episode is again personal. Moving from India to Japan, I
  had to give up soap bars and start using Body wash! Thankfully, I was able
  to find body wash of the same brand as I was used to in India. Nonetheless,
  this has a very interesting and confused narration from the Bar of soap
  where she talks about how the less she is being used, the higher her life
  expectancy is. So, while she seems to feel bad that she isn’t being used as
  much anymore, she’s happy she gets to live longer!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Today Explained</strong> - <strong>Do It for the Gram</strong></p>

    <p>A scientific one: this is about how the Kilogram was recently redefined to
  be absolutely measurable by anyone - with enough money, space and motivation
  to actually want that kind of accuracy. Earlier, the definition followed the
  simpler path of having a block that was defined to be 1 kg. <strong>This was again
  one of those awe-inspirin moments when I realized that we have come such a
  long way in these fields where we clearly understand that working together
  with everyone in the world is the only way to solve a problem.</strong> This time,
  the problem being: standardized measurement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ezra Klein Show</strong> - <strong>Doris Kearns Goodwin</strong></p>

    <p>A presidential historian. Given how much of the media cycle and brain space
  American presidents take up in the form of news, movies, podcasts; it’s only
  fair to listen to someone who has spent her time curating stories about
  these people at the very top of civilization and yet somehow very hard to
  understand because, as she begins the podcast with, “You have to be a little
  crazy to want that kind of pressure”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ezra Klein Show</strong> - <strong>Jonathan Haidt</strong> <strong>5/5</strong></p>

    <p>And finally, the podcast that I want everyone to hear. I was fairly
  impressed with this conversation. Impressed enough to buy his book the next
  day and read it through the weekend. It was one of the most eye-opening
  books for me. Though I have known for a while that people don’t change their
  political beliefs no matter how much logical arguments you throw at them,
  this was the first book that really spelled out why that was in unambiguous
  language. There’s a lot to decode in the book and I intend to write a review
  and a blog post about that. The podcast is about the recent campus movements
  and where they came from. <strong>There’s this one section of the podcast where they
  discuss how kids nowadays have to be forced to go outside and leave their
  computers and how, in a weird way, it makes them the most well-behaved
  children in the past few decades.</strong> All they want to do is stay at home and
  chat on the Internet. The podcast is full of revelatory moments like that.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is end of post 2 in this series!</p>
