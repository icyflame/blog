  <p><em>Note:</em> This post is very delayed (it should have been out on December 27th); It
was stored as a note on my iPhone with a set of links. I have added a short
summary of each podcast and why I liked like it other posts in this series.
Let’s dive in!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Daily</strong> - <strong>Ethics of Genetically Editing Babies</strong></p>

    <p>This is related to the story where a Chinese scientist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/health/gene-editing-babies-china.html">claimed</a> to have
  created / helped make (what even is the right word?) the world’s first
  genetically edited babies. After discussing this case and talking about what
  actually happened and why it might be suspect, the guest on this show goes
  on to describe why one or two reckless scientists like this person can
  actually end up forcing countries around the world to heavily regulate or
  even completely stop the research into this field because they don’t trust
  the scientists anymore. I think that that was a very succinct explanation of
  why things like this are bad, while also keeping in mind that more and more
  of the things that we consider impossible in our lifetimes will become
  possible and someone will do them. And our tolerance of innovation might
  very well be defined by our acceptance or rejection of these ground breaking
  events.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>
    <p><strong>The Daily</strong> - <strong>The Business of Selling Your Location</strong></p>

    <p>Nothing new here for anyone who has given thought to how conglomerates like
  Google actually make money (from services like Gmail, Search, Calendar and
  Youtube) which are used for free by most people. This episode does mention
  some companies that collect a lot more than is clearly stated on the app (no
  surprise there) and how that data, if looked at person by person, can create
  a pretty good map of their life: where they live, the restaurants they
  frequent, the people they meet up with, and so on. <strong>P.S.:</strong> Stop using
  Google and all of it’s products; Pay for e-mail, use an open source browser.
  Those are some of the steps that I have taken to feel better about the
  providers I am using day-in-day-out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Future Perfect</strong> - <strong>How to be a better carnivore</strong></p>

    <p>This is a great episode about how eating meat or fish isn’t the worst thing
  in the world. Lately, I feel like there has been this (almost) movement
  among a lot of people to <em>Go Vegan</em> and how this is somehow because they
  want to save animal life and so on. This episode is absolutely not about
  that. In fact, as the title says, it’s about killing animals that are to be
  consumed with consideration because (a) it’s a good thing to do (b) it
  actually makes fishes taste better (This episode specifically mentions
  fishes in Japan, and having eaten fish in Japan, I can confirm that fish
  dishes in Japan taste great even though they have less than about half the
  spices that a typical fish dish in India would have!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Future Perfect</strong> - <strong>How our drinking water could help prevent suicide</strong></p>

    <p>Another interesting Future Perfect episode: Lithium in the water can reduce
  the number of people who suffer from depression! In fact, “Four of five
  studies reviewed found that places with higher levels of trace lithium had
  lower suicide rates.” There’s a bit of doubt and debate about whether this
  is a real thing or not. Irrespective of that, it is an interesting story and
  connects well to the story of the Fluoride Wars and how one person started a
  movement that convinced almost a whole town that putting Fluoride in the
  water supply is unnecessary and harmful to the residents!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
