  <p>Happy New Year! Let’s jump right in!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>This American Life</strong> - <strong>The Walls</strong> - <strong>5/5</strong></p>

    <p>A fascinating episode! This American Life is one of those podcasts that I
  listen to rarely, but every time I do I end up with an episode that is
  absolute gold! This episode came out at the top of the “Trump shut down the
  government for a wall” news story and debates some of the amazing walls
  around the world. The conclusion is simple: <em>Walls make us feel safe</em>,
  irrespective of how big they are, whether there’s another wall on the other
  side of the wall on <em>our</em> side, whether it actually even exists or has been
  conjured out of nowhere just to pacify us. This episode also follows the
  story of a man who has lived all his life with a wall in his home country; A
  wall that has made his relatives strangers to him and how he reconciles with
  that. <em>Once a wall is built, it becomes a fact of life and affects the way
  life is lived around it</em> When put like that, we really see how much power
  walls have! An absolutely amazing episode!</p>
  </li>

    <p><strong>The Slow Burn</strong> - <strong>Season 1: Watergate</strong></p>

    <p>The Watergate scandal is something that was shrouded in a lot of mystery
  for me before I heard the first season of this podcast. The scandal is
  mentioned so often no matter which country’s news channel you turn on. It’s
  this daring attempt at covering up something that so many people knew that
  anyone who must have looked at it from the outside, in the aftermath, would
  have said: “AH! That could never have been kept under wraps” and yet the
  truth is, that it <em>was</em> kept under wraps for quite a long time. Listening to
  this podcast really makes you think about what would be discussed as
  <em>history</em> 50 years from now when other people are analyzing the choices that
  were made by us. A rivetting story that tries to get to the scandal from as
  many angles as possible!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Modern Love</strong> - <strong>What The Sea Took Away</strong></p>

    <p>This episode talks about how to deal with loss, loss that is inexplicable.
  Loss that doesn’t come with the elusive concept of <em>eventual closure</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Modern Love</strong> - <strong>A Young Man’s Game</strong></p>

    <p>An episode about how bearing children is a young man’s game. It’s funny and
  evocative. One of the quotes that stayed with me after I finished listening
  to the episode: “I traveled and I wrote books, and I loved that life.  But I
  truly regret that Larkin hasn’t gotten to know to know my mother, other than
  through our stories”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Modern Love</strong> - <strong>How To Break Up With a 2 Year-old</strong></p>

    <p>Another amazing Modern Love episode! I have really been sucked into this
  podcast, it’s amazing essays and narations! This episode is about how babies
  attach so easily and so effortlessly with adults and even as they grow up to
  forget these adults and how important they were to them as babies, the
  adults keep getting older and realizing more and more how insignificant a
  part they were of this young human being’s life! Heart warming and heart
  breaking, in just a few paragraphs. If you can’t listen to the episode,
  definitely read the <a href="https://www.wbur.org/modernlove/2018/11/07/how-to-break-up-phillips-sandell">essay</a>.</p>
