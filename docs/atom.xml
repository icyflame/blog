   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This past weekend, I wanted to set up Miniflux, a browser-based RSS&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; reader. I have been using
it locally for the past two weeks and it has been extremely worthwhile. It has the dual advantage of
always being online and the ability to categorize feeds, which helps me group the feeds that I want
to &lt;strong&gt;read&lt;/strong&gt; (blogs) from those that I want to &lt;strong&gt;skim&lt;/strong&gt; (news). I did not want to set up a Miniflux
instance which would have ports open to the Internet. I wanted the instance to be available &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt;
inside a private network; I wanted to use Wireguard to set up the private network. I ran into a
problem that looks extremely simple in hindsight: The packets which were being sent on the Wireguard
interface were larger than the Max Transmission Unit of &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; router between the VPS&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and my
laptop. This is something that I have not run into before. It was interesting to delve through the
various layers of Linux’ networking stack. What follows is an account of my investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial set up was very easy to get up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, create a Wireguard network with 3 peers: the VPS, my laptop, and my phone. Inside the
Wireguard tunnel, the VPS was at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.1.1&lt;/code&gt; and my laptop was at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.1.2&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ping
192.168.1.1&lt;/code&gt; on my laptop yielded the correct result; 64 byte ICMP&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; packets were being
exchanged between the two ends of the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ping &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt; 2 192.168.1.1
PING 192.168.1.1 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;192.168.1.1&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 56&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;84&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;icmp_seq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;1 &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ttl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;64 &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;19.4 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;icmp_seq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;2 &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ttl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;64 &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;6.22 ms

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt; 192.168.1.1 ping statistics &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;time &lt;/span&gt;1002ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 6.215/12.810/19.406/6.595 ms
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, start Miniflux using a docker container: The Docker container was listening on the host port
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;10443&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;127.0.0.1:10443&lt;/code&gt;). Locally, from the VPS itself, requests to the Miniflux endpoints
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; (which loads the login page) and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/version&lt;/code&gt; (which prints the semantic version of the running
Miniflux) worked well. (The running database container has a port but this port is not exposed to
the host network.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker ps &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--format&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;\t&apos;&lt;/span&gt; | column &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt;
miniflux/miniflux:latest  127.0.0.1:10443-&amp;gt;8080/tcp
postgres:15               5432/tcp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, install and configure Nginx on the VPS. A single site was enabled with the following
configuration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-cfg&quot;&gt;server {
	listen 192.168.1.1:80 default_server;

	charset utf-8;
	location /healthz {
		return 200;
	}

	location / {
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:10443;
	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After restarting the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nginx.service&lt;/code&gt; Systemd unit, I expected &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl http://192.168.1.1/healthz&lt;/code&gt; to
return an empty response with HTTP 200 status code. This worked. The request was logged in the Nginx
access log. I tried &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl http://192.168.1.1/&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Here, the problem begins to make itself known:&lt;/strong&gt; The
request reaches Nginx and is logged in the Nginx access log. The request also reaches inside the
Miniflux container&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, no response is returned to Curl. In fact, Curl just keeps waiting
forever. The request is handled in a few milliseconds according to Miniflux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alone was not too distressing. It indicates that Nginx’ &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;proxy_pass&lt;/code&gt; directive is not
working. I don’t expect these kind of things to start working immediately because there is always
some minor misconfiguration, which can only be found in a second pass over the system. Also, there
were many parts of the setup that I had not even thought about at this point: firewall rules on my
laptop; firewall rules on the VPS; (perhaps) the hosting provider has a separate set of firewall
rules for outbound traffic (similar to GCP?); (perhaps) my router is not set up to accept incoming
TCP or UDP packets. I would have cycled through these theories … had it not been for this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;curl http://192.168.1.1/version
2.2.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requests to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/version&lt;/code&gt; endpoint on &lt;em&gt;the same server&lt;/em&gt; along the identical &lt;em&gt;network path&lt;/em&gt; worked;
the response was coming from Miniflux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more &lt;em&gt;confounding variable:&lt;/em&gt; Another member in this Wireguard mesh network was a smart phone. I
attempted to load &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://192.168.1.1/&lt;/code&gt; from that device in Firefox, and the page loaded! It showed
the appropriate login page that I was expecting to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tethering this phone to my laptop using a USB cable and turning off WiFi, I noticed that on the 4G
network of my phone too, the login page worked. Here is a matrix of what worked and what did not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Device&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Network&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/version&lt;/code&gt; works?&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Login page works?&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Laptop&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Home WiFi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Laptop&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Cellular&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;iPhone&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Home WiFi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;iPhone&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Cellular&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what was going on here precisely? This was going to be something either very interesting and
specific to my setup, or something fairly silly, such as a misconfiguration somewhere. Nevertheless,
I was in for the long haul: &lt;strong&gt;A completely broken system is easier to fix than a partially broken
one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;iptables&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iptables&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried my best to stay away from the actual implementation and usage of iptables. I know about
iptables and their usual use cases. I can even get away with reading rules, such as this
implementation of a reverse proxy using &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; iptables (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/private-connectivity&quot;&gt;courtesy: GCP&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport $DB_PORT -j DNAT --to-destination $DB_ADDR:$DB_PORT
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j SNAT --to-source $LOCAL_IP_ADDR
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I need to explain the above. It is pretty intuitive.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; iptables is a core feature
of the Linux Kernel, but there are some quirks in using it “properly.” Most of the quirks can be
demonstrated using the following diagram, taken from the Wikipedia page on iptables:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/packet-flow-wikipedia.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is the text too small to read? You’re getting the point now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jokes apart, the design of netfilter and the frontend to netfilter, iptables, is pretty good (I have
heard.) It makes everything possible: you can “mangle” packets, update where they come from, update
where they go, prevent packets from entering the system, … and so on. All of it happens inside the
kernel. Generally, I avoid &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iptables&lt;/code&gt; and use the simpler wrapper &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ufw&lt;/code&gt; (Universal Firewall). &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ufw&lt;/code&gt;
adds rules to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; table’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;INPUT&lt;/code&gt; chain. By the way, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ufw&lt;/code&gt; alone is not good enough if you
are using Docker. See this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker#solving-ufw-and-docker-issues&quot;&gt;well-known&lt;/a&gt; flaw when the two are used together, which is introduced due
to the rules that are added to iptables when Docker is installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, I had added only the default &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ufw&lt;/code&gt; rules, which deny all incoming and routed traffic,
and allow all outgoing traffic. To take this out of the equation, I disabled UFW completely. UFW
outputs logs whenever it blocks packets and these can be seen in the output of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dmesg -wT&lt;/code&gt;. The
packets that were supposed to make their way back from the VPS to my laptop were not showing up
here. Interestingly, in the few minutes that the VPS did not have any firewall enabled, I saw
several logs to Nginx from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan&quot;&gt;masscan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ivre.rocks/&quot;&gt;ivre-masscan&lt;/a&gt;. These tools are scraping the whole Internet in
about 5 minutes: &lt;strong&gt;That&lt;/strong&gt; is very cool. I have used only &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; for amateur port scanning (mostly to
see whether sshd is actually listening on some port) and netcat to check for things like MySQL
servers and SSH servers, both of which will write their version and the authentication plugin that
they are using if you open a netcat connection with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;docker&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, right. Docker starts virtual bridge networks which are separate from the host
network, but are connected together through the 172.17/16 subnet. The device &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker0&lt;/code&gt; takes
every packet that is bound for this subnet by adding a route to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ip route&lt;/code&gt;, and presumably,
redirects the packet to the right container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is fairly good. I did not have many doubts here. The requests were clearly going through
Docker and reaching the container inside it. I started the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;httpd&lt;/code&gt; container; and … it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# On the VPS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker run &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt; httpd &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; 8080:80 httpd:alpine
88d95f2bce5bae6edbfde87ac4e57295038689790bf37cd26e65ddc04b9f79f7

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# On my laptop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;curl http://192.168.1.1:8080
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;It works!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, the small response sent by &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;httpd&lt;/code&gt; worked well, whereas the login page was still not
working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To completely avoid having to deal with Docker, I downloaded the static binary of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;miniflux&lt;/code&gt; from
GitHub and ran it locally. Once again, local requests to the login page worked, while remote
requests to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/version&lt;/code&gt; did not work. I was stuck with the same problem even without Docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ufw&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ufw&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, I did not want ports to be open on the VPS because there are large programs that are
scanning all of the Internet a few hundred times each day. So, I had enabled &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ufw&lt;/code&gt; allowing only
incoming UDP traffic on one port for Wireguard and incoming TCP traffic on another port for SSH. I
did not expect these rules to be causing problems, and they were apparently not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completely disabling UFW did not make any difference at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; One quirk of UFW is the file &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/ufw/after.rules&lt;/code&gt;. When UFW is disabled, the iptables
which are added by &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ufw&lt;/code&gt; are removed. The rules which are added to iptables from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;after.rules&lt;/code&gt;
are not reverted. I guess this is because UFW does not know how to revert these rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;ufw disable
Firewall stopped and disabled on system startup

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;iptables &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-S&lt;/span&gt; ufw-logging-deny
iptables v1.8.7 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;nf_tables&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;: chain &lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;ufw-logging-deny&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos; in table `filter&apos;&lt;/span&gt; is incompatible, use &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;nft&apos;&lt;/span&gt; tool.

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;ufw &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;enable
&lt;/span&gt;Firewall is active and enabled on system startup

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;iptables &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-S&lt;/span&gt; ufw-logging-deny
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-N&lt;/span&gt; ufw-logging-deny
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-A&lt;/span&gt; ufw-logging-deny &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; conntrack &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--ctstate&lt;/span&gt; INVALID &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; limit &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--limit&lt;/span&gt; 3/min &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--limit-burst&lt;/span&gt; 10 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-j&lt;/span&gt; RETURN
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-A&lt;/span&gt; ufw-logging-deny &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; limit &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--limit&lt;/span&gt; 3/min &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--limit-burst&lt;/span&gt; 10 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-j&lt;/span&gt; LOG &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--log-prefix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;[UFW BLOCK] &quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;tcpdump&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had reached the point where I would &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to resort to using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; is a great tool
for debugging network problems. I have used it a few times when working with Istio.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt;, the toughest part is to get to the really useful packet dumps. For this, I began
with the requests that worked: I chose the very simple &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/robots.txt&lt;/code&gt; response from Miniflux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;curl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-vvv&lt;/span&gt; http://192.168.1.1/robots.txt
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.1
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.74.0
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; Accept: &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;snip]

&lt;p&gt;The TCP dump output on both sides of the tunnel was identical. It looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fairly boring. The only thing to notice here is that the length of all of these UDP packets
sent by Wireguard is very small. (This fact was not remarkable to me &lt;strong&gt;during&lt;/strong&gt; the investigation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately, I noticed that these &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;length 1452&lt;/code&gt; packets were the ones which were not making it to
the laptop. As I was running &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; on both sides, I could see that the smaller packets of
various sizes (112, 96, 864) were making it through perfectly fine and in the same order. However,
the largest of these packets, of size 1452 bytes, were not making it through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued running the same tcpdump command and now checked the request &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GET /&lt;/code&gt; on my iPhone with
the WiFi network:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;13:10:30.755011 IP vps.44215 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; iphone.50000: UDP, length 592

13:10:30.767844 IP iphone.50000 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; vps.44215: UDP, length 1312

13:10:30.778499 IP vps.44215 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; iphone.50000: UDP, length 96
13:10:30.809367 IP vps.44215 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; iphone.50000: UDP, length 480

13:10:30.820942 IP vps.44215 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; iphone.50000: UDP, length 96
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, things got interesting, Despite being on the same network, the VPS was sending the iPhone
smaller packets of 1312 bytes. At this point, I pretty much knew that something was off about these
large packets and some thing was dropping them in the middle. I still did not know what or why
though. Before we get there, a small detour through one of the other theories I had during my
investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;other-theories&quot;&gt;Other theories&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My home network is a broadband Internet connection, which uses IPoE (Internet Protocol over
Ethernet). This is an improvement over PPPoE&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with the primary merit being that there is no
PPPoE authentication server when sending packets outside. Packets are sent directly to the ISP’s
router which is closest to my home.  Packets are authenticated implicitly: The very fact that I am
able to send packets to the ISP routers at a given port implies that I &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be a subscriber of
their service. It works remarkably well; with download speeds increasing at least 2X from not having
to go to the authentication server repeatedly. IPoE is not very well documented (at least from what
I could tell.) The only documentation I could find was an old PDF written by Juniper Networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, my ISP is also only capable of IPv6 over IPoE. They partner with another company, which
provides IPv4 over IPv6 transfer. This is powered by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_transition_mechanism#Dual-Stack_Lite_(DS-Lite)&quot;&gt;Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite)&lt;/a&gt; protocol. I don’t
know much about these protocols except for a basic idea about what they are supposed to do. One of
the disadvantages of using IPoE is that there is no static IP support anymore: I am on a local
network which is managed by my ISP and all packets go through this partner before reaching the
requested IPv4 destination. All of these things sounded suspicious; were hard to understand; and
sounded very much like the root cause of my woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between IPv6 and IPv4 is the size of the header: 40 bytes vs. 20 bytes. If I
want to send an IPv4 packet inside an IPv6 packet, the header size would now be 60 bytes per packet,
I reasoned. So, the actual data that can be transmitted over IPv4 over IPv6 networks would be 40
bytes less than what Wireguard thought it should be.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The packet size which was not transmitted
(1452) and the one that was (1312) seemed to point in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;answer-max-transmission-unit&quot;&gt;Answer: Max Transmission Unit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I landed on MTU and started thinking about it. The only other context in which I had heard
about MTU was that of WiFi networks. Changing the MTU of a WiFi network is supposed to make things
faster by increasing packet sizes, and reducing the number of roundtrips on the high latency WiFi
connection between a device and the router.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My router’s settings page told me that the MTU which was configured for the home network
was 1500. The MTU which had been negotiated with my ISP was 1454. This number was uncomfortably
close to the size of the packets which were being dropped. I looked around for more information
about MTU and landed on the precise problem that I was facing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.cisco.com/t5/collaboration-knowledge-base/pmtud-blackhole/ta-p/3115561&quot;&gt;MTU blackholing&lt;/a&gt;. The server was
attempting to send a packet that was too big for some link along the way. Whichever router rejects
the packet, sends a special ICMP message back to the VPS, telling it that the packet size is too
big, and that the data should be broken up into multiple packets. However, the VPS is either not
listening for these ICMP packets or blocking them or something else: It does not act appropriately
and reduce the packet size. Instead, it just keeps retrying the same packet until the underlying TCP
connection eventually gives up, assuming that the destination is not listening anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution was to specify &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MTU = 1400&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[Interface]&lt;/code&gt; sections of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wg-quick&lt;/code&gt;
configurations on both the VPS and my laptop. After restarting the Wireguard interfaces, I was able
to confirm that the solution worked by requesting &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://192.168.1.1/&lt;/code&gt; using Curl and a
browser. The TCP dump output was interesting too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest packet which was transmitted was 1432 bytes, despite the Wireguard link’s MTU being set
to 1400. The 32 byte difference is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; because of the 16 byte header for Wireguard packets
and the 16 byte authentication tag at the end of the UDP packet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;20-byte IPv4 header or 40 byte IPv6 header&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;8-byte UDP header&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;4-byte type&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;4-byte key index&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;8-byte nonce&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;N-byte encrypted data&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;16-byte authentication tag&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://marc.info/?l=wireguard&amp;amp;m=151295619820317&quot;&gt;Re: [WireGuard] Header / MTU sizes for Wireguard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MTU = 1400&lt;/code&gt; setting, I ran &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tracepath --mtu 192.168.1.1&lt;/code&gt; and found that the MTU
detected by Wireguard
was 1420. I have a sneaking, unconfirmed suspicion that this is because of IPv4 over
IPv6, and its additional overhead of 40 bytes per packet. The numbers don’t completely add up: 1420
does not work, 1400 works, but the overhead of using IPv4 over IPv6 is 40 bytes (Right?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my plan to confirm this is to set up a VPS which has IPv6 connectivity and use the VPS’ public
IPv6 address and check whether the automatically detected MTU works in that case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One point of proof that I have for this theory is another Wireguard network that has a VPS with IPv6
connectivity. When using the VPS’ IPv6 public IP address, I can confirm that the MTU of 1420 works
properly in that case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This investigation was a rewarding one and even though it took me nearly 3-4 hours to find all the
components that were in the path from my laptop to the VPS, it was completely worth it to understand
one of the fundamental systems that makes the Internet &lt;strong&gt;work:&lt;/strong&gt; Path MTU detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;further-research&quot;&gt;Further research&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PMTUD (Path MTU Detection) is a very important protocol. ICMP messages of the type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Destination
  Not Reachable&lt;/code&gt; should not be dropped. There are some RFCs with solutions to the problem of over
blocking of ICMP packets. I am not sure how much they have been adopted though. Perhaps the
confusion among administrators who think that all of ICMP is bad is that ICMP is also used for
Ping and can be used to detect the IP addresses that have any sort of running host.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TCP has its own variable Maximum Segment Size (MSS) which is decided during the TCP handshake. We
can use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iptables&lt;/code&gt; (yay!) to ensure that TCP’s MSS is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Mangling_packet_headers&quot;&gt;clamped&lt;/a&gt; to the value of MTU.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tracepath --mtu $destination&lt;/code&gt; can be used to find the actual MTU that is detected between any two
hosts. This works only if PMTUD is supported by all the hops along the path from the source to the
destination. I don’t know what the decided MTU is if PMTUD just fails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Of course, I am joking. These two lines add rules to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nat&lt;/code&gt; table’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PREROUTING&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;POSTROUTING&lt;/code&gt; chain. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PREROUTING&lt;/code&gt; chain rule looks for TCP packets with the destination port set to some required value &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$DB_PORT&lt;/code&gt;. If the packet matches this rule, then we “jump” (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-j&lt;/code&gt;) to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DNAT&lt;/code&gt; chain. This is a virtual state which does what we want: “It specifies that the destination address of the packet should be modified (and all future packets in this connection will also be mangled), and rules should cease being examined. It takes one type of option: –to-destination ipaddr[-ipaddr][:port-port] which can specify a single new destination IP address” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables&quot;&gt;man:iptables(8)&lt;/a&gt;). The second rule is self-explanatory. (Again, I am joking.) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;slightly funny&lt;/em&gt; to me that I was complaining about the complexity introduced by usage of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iptables&lt;/code&gt; when I use Istio on a weekly basis at work.

   <title>Using an iPhone Without Windows or Apple Computers</title>
   <link href="/2024/08/29/using-iphone-without-windows-or-apple"/>
   <updated>2024-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2024/08/29/using-iphone-without-windows-or-apple</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I bought an iPhone 5 years ago. Admittedly, it was a strange choice: I don’t like proprietary
software that one can not customize. I knew that iPhones work well only if one was willing to pay
for subscription services like iCloud and Apple Music. The fights that Epic Games and Spotify have
started in court over Apple’s attempts to block their native integration into iOS is
well-known. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; I bought one anyway, because I could not get an unlocked Android phone (back then)
in Japan, and I certainly did not want to buy a locked phone, pay for overpriced cellular network
coverage for 2 years before the phone could be unlocked and I could switch to a different
carrier. So, an iPhone was the &lt;em&gt;least worst option.&lt;/em&gt; Over the years, I have struggled with iPhone’s
software to do basic things, such as writing a text file, transferring photos to a hard drive,
understanding how exactly WhatsApp and other such apps store their pictures within the phone,
optimizing to never go past the 30% disk usage mark because flash memory becomes extremely slow
beyond it and makes the phone unusable, and using browsers like Firefox without the ability to
install ad or tracker blocking plugins. This post is a summary of some of the things that I have
learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that is worth appreciating is that iPhone’s software is rather strange and has a lot of
features, which apparently improve security. I don’t know enough to say whether that is actually the
case. Nevertheless, most obstacles faced during the process of taking data &lt;strong&gt;out&lt;/strong&gt; of the iPhone are
related to intentional design choices which make interoperability impossible. Even in the cases
where it is possible, various hoops need to be jumped through and the process is probably a
nightmare for a layperson who just wants to get something done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;photos-and-file-transfer&quot;&gt;Photos And File Transfer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just the past week, I started using KDE Connect. There is an application on the iOS app store which
serves as the client, and the Gnome Shell extension GSConnect runs on the Linux host. Photos can be
transferred in their original HEIF format over a local WiFi connection. The installation of both
these components is very simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transfer speed is very fast (the line rate of your WiFi network or the speed at which files can
be written to your local disk, whichever is lower.) The only consideration is that the phone’s
screen should not lock during the period that the photos are being transferred. I was able to
transfer as many as 250 files in a single transfer. I can probably transfer up to a 1000 files, but
I have not tried it out yet. (If you have tried it, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:mail@siddharthkannan.in&quot;&gt;tell me&lt;/a&gt; the hardware that you are using, and I
will update this post with the information.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same approach can be used to transfer text files (more on this in the next section) or to
control the cursor and enter text on your computer from your phone or connected device (not sure why
this is ever required? Slideshow?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KDE Connect works by starting a TCP/UDP server on a port on the host. (Usually the port number is
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1716&lt;/code&gt;, but check your local installation’s output for the command &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ss -tulpn&lt;/code&gt; to find the actual
port. The process name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gjs&lt;/code&gt; on Debian 11.) This port should be able to receive traffic on the
local network:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ufw allow &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;on wlan0 proto tcp from 192.168.1.0/24 to 192.168.1.0/24 port 1716
Rule added

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ufw allow &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;on wlan0 proto udp from 192.168.1.0/24 to 192.168.1.0/24 port 1716
Rule added

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; One thing you should remember to do is to turn off Gnome Shell Extensions &lt;strong&gt;completely&lt;/strong&gt; once
you are done importing files. I have noticed that once a phone is paired, whenever both the phone
and the computer are on the same network, they get connected automatically. I don’t want that to
happen unless I am manually connecting for some reason. There is an authorization prompt when a
phone is paired for the first time. But that authorization is a one-time process, and things such as
controlling the cursor of the computer &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the phone or entering text on the computer are
possible once this process is completed. This is a minefield which is best avoided by turning off
Extensions completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;old-process-using-windows&quot;&gt;Old Process: Using Windows&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are not able to use KDE Connect, the following process will work.&lt;/em&gt; It takes more time,
requires a recent Windows OS installation, and lot of moving files around between Windows and
Linux. I am leaving this here as a record of my old (painful) process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 3 years after buying the phone and taking pictures with it, I wanted to import photos to my
hard drive and store them there, along with photos from my handheld digital camera. The motivation
was mainly to store all my photos together in a single Shotwell database. An added advantage was
that resetting the phone to factory defaults and starting fresh would speed it up significantly,
increase battery life, and reduce overheating during charging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many hurdles. The first few hurdles were fairly simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Importing required a Windows OS running the horrible Windows application Windows
Photos. Everything is “implicit.” So, you have to plug-in your phone and &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; that the device is
detected and an “Import Photos” option shows up. Apple has also seemed to have stopped maintaining
iTunes, an application that I used several years ago to transfer MP3 files to an iPod.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can set the iPhone to import photos in the widely supported JPEG format, or in the original
“HEIF” format, which was hard to work with. I set the option to import as JPEG as I wanted to
handle JPEG photos rather than HEIF photos. (The reduced disk storage, which is a major reason for
using HEIF, was not a big issue for me at the time.) But if you try to import too many pictures as
JPEG, then the import process … &lt;em&gt;goes kaput,&lt;/em&gt; for lack of a better phrase. There is no error
message and the import process just stays stuck for a period of time and then fails with the super
generic &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Import has failed. Please try again later.&lt;/code&gt; message. I think this must be because of the
“import as JPEG” option because the conversion from HEIF to JPEG must be performed on the iPhone
and it is probably too resource intensive to be completed on the iPhone within some timeout.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Recently, packages like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heif-gdk-pixbuf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heif-thumbnailer&lt;/code&gt; have made working with HEIF
files on Linux convenient. About a year ago, Shotwell also &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/shotwell/blob/master/NEWS#L24&quot;&gt;started supporting&lt;/a&gt; HEIF file
variants. You need to be on the latest stable distribution version to be able to use the latest
Shotwell version though. I tried to build the latest Shotwell version on a Debian 11 VM, and it
was … &lt;em&gt;very hard.&lt;/em&gt; I had to give up because many of the shared libraries which need to be
linked are not updated on older distributions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once you start importing files as HEIF files, the process works most  of the time. I have found
that it is unreliable if you attempt to import more than 200 photos at a time. So, I would go from
the past to the present and select months to import.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t make the mistake of using albums on the iPhone because this metadata is not exposed at all
and will be completely lost as soon as you bring the photos out of the iPhone. So, I have begun
doing all of my categorization &lt;strong&gt;exclusively&lt;/strong&gt; inside Shotwell.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After importing the files in the HEIF format, they can be converted into JPEG using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copytrans.net/copytransheic/&quot;&gt;CopyTransHEIC&lt;/a&gt;. This is a free piece of software for Windows. However, the free version can only
convert 100 photos at a time. So, you will have to select batches of 100 photos and convert them
to JPEG. This is also mildly annoying when working with large photo collections, such as one that
I worked with which had 5000 photos, everything from the first day the phone was bought to right
before the import. In that case, I transferred the files back to Linux, put them in 50 folders
each containing 99 files, and then went back to windows: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ctrl + A&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Convert to JPEG&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; Wait
=&amp;gt; Proceed to next folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to using computers, 2024 edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;Plaintext&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plaintext is the only truly universal file format.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A plaintext file written in the 1960s can
&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/726338/the-code-that-took-america-to-the-moon-was-just-published-to-github-and-its-like-a-1960s-time-capsule&quot;&gt;still be read&lt;/a&gt; using the standard tools which are installed on every operating system, including
mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iOS is the exception that proves the rule, of course. The OS works tirelessly to confuse users into
believing that files do not exist and that folders are a thing of the past. The recently added Files
app is a pretty bad application and is slower than most feature phones from the 2010s. The recent
changes on Google Drive have a similar motivation, in my opinion. This approach has also been a
major part of why Gmail is so popular. It encourages users to maintain a huge set of files, which
are not categorized well. The only way to get to the file that you want is to search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, coerce users into creating files haphazardly without thinking about where they should put a
file. (“You need a Document? Just create it on the home screen of Google Drive!”) Then, once you
have made this a habit, sell them recurring subscriptions to software that you now &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to use to
make sense of all the documents which were created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only solution I have found to this is the brilliant iOS application &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/726338/the-code-that-took-america-to-the-moon-was-just-published-to-github-and-its-like-a-1960s-time-capsule&quot;&gt;Subtext&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;strong&gt;simple&lt;/strong&gt;
text editor, which does not need an Internet connection to start-up. (This is a problem with Notion,
Evernote, and Fastmail; all of which I have used briefly.) Files created using Subtext can be synced
to any computer using KDE Connect, the method that I described for photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I noticed that even Dropbox now has the ability to create a text file inside its
app. Files created in the app are automatically synced to your Dropbox Cloud account and accessible
from other devices on the same Dropbox account. This might be useful for you if you are unable to
use KDE Connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ssh&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to SSH into a remote server running Linux from an iPhone is a pretty big advantage. This
is not an absolute requirement and I have lived without this for five years. Recently though, I wanted to
use &lt;a href=&quot;https://ledger-cli.org/&quot;&gt;Ledger&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of some expenses while on the move. I could use Subtext to write each
expense in Ledger’s understated and simple format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2024-07-20 Dinner
  Expenses:Food:Dinner  INR 450
  Liabilities:CC
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After entering a few expenses, in order to validate the text file and &lt;em&gt;balance the books&lt;/em&gt;, I would
need to use Ledger’s CLI somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termius-terminal-ssh-client/id549039908&quot;&gt;Terminus&lt;/a&gt; is my preferred solution for this. Terminus doubles as both an SFTP client (to transfer the
text file to the remotely running Linux machine) and as an SSH client (providing the ability to run
commands on the Linux machine.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not plan this all out before leaving for my trip; and the whole idea began as a way to
streamline the integration of expenses during the trip back into my “main” expenses file. So, while
I was on my trip, I generated an SSH key on Terminus, added it to Digital Ocean, created a Linux VM
there, SSH-ed in using Terminus, installed Legder and some other tools like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ripgrep&lt;/code&gt;. The whole
process was &lt;em&gt;surprisingly smooth.&lt;/em&gt; So, credit to the Digital Ocean frontend team for making a
website which was super easy to use even from mobile Firefox. (The website was not responsive or a
complete redesign or anything, but it was compatible with mobile Firefox completely, and used
standard HTTP elements which work well on all browsers anyway, rather than custom JavaScript-based
monstrosities which attempt to validate input before it is submitted or use modals for input fields,
and seldom work well on mobile browsers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it is even more universal than PDF, which still requires a PDF reader, is not easily searchable without one, and is impossible to edit without paid software. I have tried to edit PDF files by breaking them up into images, using GIMP to edit the images, and then putting the PDF back together, but the final PDF looked noticeable worse than the original one. Good software which can do native PDF editing such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bluebeam.com/pricing/&quot;&gt;Bluebeam&lt;/a&gt; costs $260 per year for a single user. A steep price to pay. Plaintext can be edited using Geddit, Subtext, Notepad++, Notepad, and or some other built-in text file editor on every operating system. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Notes and Review - White Noise (DeLillo)</title>
   <link href="/2024/06/12/book-review-delillo-white-noise"/>
   <updated>2024-06-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2024/06/12/book-review-delillo-white-noise</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating:&lt;/strong&gt; 5/5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if a novel was &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; funny? If every single sentence that came out of the protagonist’s mouth,
only served to make him look progressively less important and more foolish than you thought?  What
if it was the author mocking the protagonist privately to the reader, without letting the
protagonist in on the joke? &lt;strong&gt;That&lt;/strong&gt; would be a great novel, and &lt;em&gt;White Noise&lt;/em&gt; fits the bill. The
protagonist is a man who walks around a college in long robes and dark glasses, because it makes him
look important and unapproachable, because it gives him authority. He continues this pretense in his
thoughts as well. The chaotic misinformation rallies that go around in the back of his car, as
everyone is talking over each other, and no one is answering the question which sparked the
conversation, are a treat to read. The level of ignorance is deliberately exaggerated to a comic
level. I can’t wait to watch the movie adaptation. Meanwhile, here’s a review of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I present this (unnecessarily) long thought that is ricocheting around the protagonist’s
phenomenally empty mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The kitchen and the bedroom are the major chambers around here, the power haunts, the sources. She
and I are alike in this, that we regard the rest of the house as storage space for furniture, toys,
all the unused objects of earlier marriages and different sets of children, the gifts of lost
in-laws, the hand-me-downs and rummages. Things, boxes. Why do these possessions carry such
sorrowful weight? There is a darkness attached to them, a foreboding. They make me wary not of
personal failure and defeat but of something more general, something large in scope and content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he wants to describe something, the best the protagonist can come up with is “something more
general, something large in scope and content.” It is DeLillo’s skill that we do not see this as
bad or lazy writing, but as the character’s inability to come up with anything really insightful. It
is not much of a comfort that the protagonist spends almost the whole book in this illusion: that he
is saying something profound, when what he is actually saying is most banal. That is to say, the
whole book is incredibly entertaining. He uses this “something” technique in one other memorable
occasion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the morning I walked to the bank. I went to the automated teller machine to check my balance. I
inserted my card, entered my secret code, tapped out my request. The figure on the screen roughly
corresponded to my independent estimate, feebly arrived at after long searches through documents,
tormented arithmetic. Waves of relief and gratitude flowed over me. The system had blessed my
life. I felt its support and approval. The system hardware, the mainframe sitting in a locked room
in some distant city. What a pleasing interaction. I sensed that something of deep personal value,
but not money, not that at all, had been authenticated and confirmed. A deranged person was escorted
from the bank by two armed guards. The system was invisible, which made it all the more impressive,
all the more disquieting to deal with. But we were in accord, at least for now. The networks, the
circuits, the streams, the harmonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various characters are the main reason I remained interested in getting to the end of the
book. The ending is not a satisfying one; it does not tie anything up; I guess that is predictable
because the story never ends (because consumerism itself has no end).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is the protagonist Jack Gladney. I have poked fun at him already. His “brain noise” is
peppered throughout the book. And the story goes in some bizarre directions. He is the anchor among
all the strange twists and turns (some of which &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; boring). He remains locked into a mind numbing
set of car rides between his house, the college where he works, and the store. Every time he goes to
the store, he buys things he does not need. Whenever he is at home, is throwing away things that he
does not need. He is a symbol: A symbol of the mindlessness that the corporations expect from
everyone, perhaps? There is one final thing that he does which I must mention. While talking with
his wife Babette, he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We’re going to come through this thing all right,” I said. “Maybe stronger than ever. We’re
determined to be well. Babette is not a neurotic person. She is strong, healthy, outgoing,
affirmative. She says yes to things. This is the point of Babette.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most present character is one of the professors at the college, Murray. He is studying “American
environments.” And is constantly talking about the “data” being strong in the grocery store. He is a
first class weirdo, but somehow he is the only one Gladney trusts and talks with and really
believes. On multiple occasions what Murray tells him about something surfaces during another
conversation or in another situation. Murray might well be the author’s stand-in: Always at the
ready to explain things that we (Gladney is the naive reader’s stand-in?) don’t understand. Here is
a classic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This is the nature of modern death,” Murray said. “It has a life independent of us. It is growing
in prestige and dimension. It has a sweep it never had before. We study it objectively. We can
predict its appearance, trace its path in the body. We can take cross-section pictures of it, tape
its tremors and waves. We’ve never been so close to it, so familiar with its habits and
attitudes. We know it intimately. But it continues to grow, to acquire breadth and scope, new
outlets, new passages and means. The more we learn, the more it grows. Is this some law of physics?
Every advance in knowledge and technique is matched by a new kind of death, a new strain. Death
adapts, like a viral agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heinrich is one of the kids in Gladney’s house. He, Heinrich, is Gladney’s son from a previous
marriage, and his mother has joined a cult as their accountant. Heinrich is constantly the most
interesting and the most confusing of all the characters: He talks about the looming ominous thing
when there is a manmade disaster near Gladney’s house and he really shines during this time: He
spreads all kinds of doubts, speculation, and theories about what is going on and is very
authoritative about it. He asks Gladney questions that throw him off his studied center; these
questions dethrone him from the pedestal of authority which Gladney maintains at the college by
wearing his robe and dark glasses. At home, he is vulnerable to Heinrich’s probing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babette speaks the least. She only has one really long conversation with Gladney. And she goes
through it matter-of-factly, without revealing much about herself. She remains the most mysterious
until the end; even though she is being seen and assessed and commented upon by everyone else, she
never has her own voice. I have a lingering feeling that she wanted to escape, and that she was one
of the saner ones in the house looking for an escape actively, rather than lamenting the apparent
lack of one as Gladney is or studying this condition as Murray was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That night, a Friday, we gathered in front of the set, as was the custom and the rule, with take-out
Chinese. There were floods, earthquakes, mud slides, erupting volcanoes. We’d never before been so
attentive to our duty, our Friday assembly. Heinrich was not sullen, I was not bored. Steffie,
brought close to tears by a sitcom husband arguing with his wife, appeared totally absorbed in these
documentary clips of calamity and death. Babette tried to switch to a comedy series about a group of
racially mixed kids who build their own communications satellite. She was startled by the force of
our objection. We were otherwise silent, watching houses slide into the ocean, whole villages
crackle and ignite in a mass of advancing lava. Every disaster made us wish for more, for something
bigger, grander, more sweeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is meandering, and this is not a novel that one would read for the story. One might read
it for its commentary on modern consumerism. One might read it simply because it is the funniest
book &lt;em&gt;ever.&lt;/em&gt; To attempt a serious review of this book would be to dissect a great joke. A joke such
as this one:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;PLEASE NOTE. In several days, your new automated banking card will arrive in the mail. If it is a
red card with a silver stripe, your secret code will be the same as it is now. If it is a green card
with a gray stripe, you must appear at your branch, with your card, to devise a new secret
code. Codes based on birthdays are popular. WARNING. Do not write down your code. Do not carry your
code on your person. REMEMBER. You cannot access your account unless your code is entered
properly. Know your code. Reveal your code to no one. Only your code allows you to enter the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I shopped with reckless abandon. I shopped for immediate needs and distant contingencies. I shopped
for its own sake, looking and touching, inspecting merchandise I had no intention of buying, then
buying it. I sent clerks into their fabric books and pattern books to search for elusive designs. I
began to grow in value and self-regard. I filled myself out, found new aspects of myself, located a
person I’d forgotten existed. Brightness settled around me. We crossed from furniture to men’s wear,
walking through cosmetics. Our images appeared on mirrored columns, in glassware and chrome, on TV
monitors in security rooms. I traded money for goods. The more money I spent, the less important it
seemed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.99&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I threw away picture-frame wire, metal book ends, cork coasters, plastic key tags, dusty bottles of
Mercurochrome and Vaseline, crusted paintbrushes, caked shoe brushes, clotted correction fluid. I
threw away candle stubs, laminated placemats, frayed pot holders. I went after the padded clothes
hangers, the magnetic memo clipboards. I was in a vengeful and near savage state. I bore a personal
grudge against these things. Somehow they’d put me in this fix. They’d dragged me down, made escape
impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.338&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Gladney is the one narrating in both those quotes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What is a radio? What is the principle of a radio? Go ahead, explain. You’re sitting in the middle
of this circle of people. They use pebble tools. They eat grubs. Explain a radio.” “There’s no
mystery. Powerful transmitters send signals. They travel through the air, to be picked up by
receivers.” “They travel through the air. What, like birds? Why not tell them magic? They travel
through the air in magic waves. What is a nucleotide? You don’t know, do you? Yet these are the
building blocks of life. What good is knowledge if it just floats in the air? It goes from computer
to computer. It changes and grows every second of every day. But nobody actually knows anything.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.173&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--quoteend--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The others who spend their lives believing that we still believe. It is our task in the world to
believe things no one else takes seriously. To abandon such beliefs completely, the human race would
die. This is why we are here. A tiny minority. To embody old things, old beliefs. The devil, the
angels, heaven, hell. If we did not pretend to believe these things, the world would collapse.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.366&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--quoteend--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“My trainer says, ‘Breathe, don’t think.’ He says, ‘Be a snake and you’ll know the stillness of a
snake.’” “He has a trainer now,” Heinrich said. “He’s a Sunny Moslem,” Orest said. “Iron City has
some Sunnies out near the airport.” “The Sunnies are mostly Korean. Except mine’s an Arab, I think.”
I said, “Don’t you mean the Moonies are mostly Korean?” “He’s a Sunny,” Orest said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Beyond 100 Megabits Per Second</title>
   <link href="/2024/03/02/beyond-100-megabits-per-second"/>
   <updated>2024-03-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2024/03/02/beyond-100-megabits-per-second</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After moving to a new apartment recently, I made a contract with an ISP offering a best effort 1
Gigabit connection. At both apartments I lived in previously in Japan, an Internet connection was
bundled with the rental agreement. As these connections had a maximum bandwidth of 100 Megabit, I
never looked at my peripherals to see whether they were capable of Gigabit. When I bought a
computer, I noticed (without much interest) that the computer’s motherboard was capable of Gigabit
ethernet. When I checked my Internet speed with a Gigabit connection, I noticed that it was only
about 93 Mbps. This post is the story of understanding my home network, the various bottlenecks
along the way, and finally, going beyond 100 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;internet-in-japan&quot;&gt;Internet in Japan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we delve into the exact setup and the various problems that I encountered during my setup, it
will be worthwhile to explain the way broadband Internet connections work in Japan. In any Internet
connection setup, there are two parts to the connection: The first part is the &lt;strong&gt;Access network&lt;/strong&gt;
which consists of all the wires which go from each subscriber’s home to the “Edge router” of the
Internet service provider (ISP). The second part is the &lt;strong&gt;ISP’s own network&lt;/strong&gt;, which peers with Internet
exchanges, public and private peers to provide full route transit to users. In Japan, these two
parts of the Internet connection are owned and administered by two different entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The access network is more-or-less completely owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone company (NTT),
one-third of which is owned by the Japanese government. Japan’s constitution has special laws
regarding NTT, which started as a state monopoly, but was later privatized in 1985. Recently, other
companies such as KDDI have also started laying their own cables to users’ homes. However, NTT still
provides the widest coverage across the country, through their product, known technically as the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ntt-east.co.jp/aboutus/ngn_about.html&quot;&gt;“Next Generation Network (NGN)”&lt;/a&gt; with the brand name “FLETS”.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The NGN is able to provide upto
&lt;a href=&quot;https://flets.com/cross/&quot;&gt;10 Gbps&lt;/a&gt; of bandwidth to individual home Internet users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This separation of the access network and the ISP networks is unusual. It is the main reason for the
large number of internet service providers for broadband Internet in Japan. The market is extremely
competitive and there are perennial discount campaigns which are run by companies to get users to
switch companies. As the access network itself remains unchanged no matter which ISP you sign up
with, switching to a different ISP is as simple as signing up for a service online, receiving PPPoE
username/password information via e-mail, and reconfiguring your router on the appropriate day and
connecting to your new ISP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this ease of shifting companies also means that predatory practices among ISPs are
common. The most notorious of these being the “contract termination” fees. Several popular ISPs have
fixed term contracts, which run for 2 or 3 years. If a contract is terminated during this period,
users are charged the contract termination fee. (Interestingly, there are discount campaigns in
which the new ISP will refund the user the contract termination fee that was charged by their
previous ISP.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In technical terms, this separation means that the equipment used to connect to the access network
is the same, irrespective of the ISP that you choose to use. It is a small black box, called the
“Optical Network Unit (ONU)”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/onu.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ONU has 1 port where one can connect a Fiber optic cable, which connects to the closest
telephone poll, managed by NTT and connecting the ONU to the access network. On the other side, it
has a RJ-45 Ethernet port which can be connected to the WAN port of your home network’s router.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another peculiar technology which is (probably) only used in Japan for home Internet access is IP
over Ethernet (IPoE). IPoE is a technology which I could not find much documentation about at
all. Several ISPs in Japan have recently started offering IPoE in order to connect to the IPv6
internet. There are also IPv6 to IPv4 translation services, which are integrated directly with the
ISPs, and allow users to use IPv4 websites from their homes (even though they do not have an IPv4
global IP address). I have not used this because my router does not support IPoE.  However, the
Linux kernel has native support for IPoE, which means that if I connect my computer &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; to
the Ethernet port on the ONU, I can use IPoE to connect to the Internet, without installing
&lt;strong&gt;anything&lt;/strong&gt; or having to configure a username and password. I have no idea how this works without
authentication. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mfeed.ad.jp/transix/overview.html&quot;&gt;The documentation&lt;/a&gt; that I was able to find suggests that the user’s location is
&lt;em&gt;inferred&lt;/em&gt; based on the physical cable which they use to connect to the ISP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary method for connecting to the IPv4 internet is the age-old Point-to-Point Protocol over
Ethernet (PPPoE), which can be configured using a username and password issued by the ISP. (IPoE
bypasses the authentication step, which removes the user’s dependence on the PPPoE authentication
server, which is apparently a common cause for slowdown during periods of congestion.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;home-network&quot;&gt;Home Network&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rooms where I had set up the ONU and the one in which I wanted to use a wired connection were
different, and quite far apart. Fortunately, the whole house was wired with Cat 5E Ethernet
cables. This cable is capable of Gigabit speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rough schematic looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/home-internet-connection-schematic.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each room was connected, by wires running through the walls and the floor, to a closet in the living
room. On the top shelf of this closet, was a wall-mounted Network switch, which can be used in
addition to a router, to provide wired connections in each room in the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A switch is a networking device which sits inside a network and increases the number of ports on a
router. While a router sits between networks (my home network and the ISP’s network), a switch sits
within a network and increases the number of computers that can connect to the network. A typical
router has a single WAN (Wide-Area Network) port and multiple LAN (Local Area Network) ports. By
connecting one of these LAN ports to a single port on the switch, any computer connected to any of
the other ports of the switch will join the same network that is being managed by the router.
Switches operate at Layer 2 (data link layer) and do not know about IP addresses. They only know
about MAC addresses and send traffic to the appropriate destination based on the information that is
contained in each packet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The router that I am using is old. However, it is capable of Gigabit speeds. So, from the ISP until
the router in my house, Gigabit speeds were possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;problems&quot;&gt;Problems&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first problem I faced was with the switch that was installed in the house. It was a very old 100
Megabit 8-port switch (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buffalo.jp/product/detail/lsw4-tx-8ns_wh.html&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;). I did not really need the 8 ports in the switch because I was
planning to use a wired connection in only one room. So, I wanted to connect the LAN cable which ran
from that room to the top shelf of the closet directly to my router. However, this was not possible
because the cables were wired tightly, with no “play” in them to allow extension outside the socket
that was connected to the switch. So, I bought an RJ45 cable extender, which can be used to provide
metallic contacts and connect two Ethernet cables head to head:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/lan-extension.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem I faced was that almost all the peripheral devices that I had were devices which
only supported 100 Megabit. This included a Raspberry Pi, which I am using as a local DNS server, an
old laptop, which has a 100M Ethernet port, and a USB-A to Ethernet adapter, which was only USB-A
2.0. This problem was resolved after I bought a USB-A 3.0 to Ethernet adapter, which did not require
any drivers to work.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/usb-to-lan-adapter.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I do not recommend this product as the USB to LAN adapter of choice. It is the TP-Link UE300
1Gigabet Ethernet to USB-A adapter. However, it uses the Realtek RTL8153 IC chip inside it and this
chip appears to be unreliable and after just a few days of use, the adapter stopped working
properly. It would start in the “connected” state with the LED light flickering, indicating that it
was working properly. But soon after that, the LED light would stop flickering and the LAN
connection would no longer be recognized by the OS. This problem with the RTL8153 IC chip &lt;a href=&quot;https://overengineer.dev/blog/2021/04/25/usb-c-hub-madness/#user-content-fn-2&quot;&gt;seems&lt;/a&gt; to
be common and a reason for the unusability of many Ethernet adapters and USB-C hubs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I was able to get speeds higher than 100 Mbps on a wired connection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/internet-speed-beyond-100-megabit.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested this setup on Windows, Mac, and Linux, at various times of the day. And the speed were
quite good, ranging from 250 Mbps to 400 Mbps. Upload speeds were even better than download speeds,
maxing out at about 500 Mbps. (I don’t upload anything at all, so this part of the symmetric
connection is mostly unused in my use-case.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a run-of-the-mill setup post. Practically speaking, the difference between 80 Mbps and 250
Mbps is not particularly remarkable; I took this more as a game to get to a setup with faster
“theoretical” speeds. Along the way, I learned about the various USB versions and their incredibly
confusing names; information that was useful to me during future setups, where I had to choose the
right USB versions for the other peripherals. One of the other interesting rabbitholes that I went
down while doing this setup was the nature of USB-C and why it is reversible and how it can do so
much, and will probably be widely adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I have not talked much about WiFi here. Basically, my router is capable only of WiFi 5, which is
capable of more than 100 Mbps theoretically. However, the latency of wireless connections is
generally high, and the Intel wireless chip that is in the motherboard of my Thinkpad laptop has
typical roundtrip times as high as 100 milliseconds. Speeds vary wildly depending on the number of
other devices and the type of data that they are using. So, I am glad that I have a good wired
connection.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are other USB to Ethernet adapters, and some of them require drivers to be installed to get them working. If you are using Linux, and the manufacturer does not distribute drivers for Linux, then you should stay away from such adapters. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Look Up</title>
   <link href="/2023/12/31/look-up"/>
   <updated>2023-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2023/12/31/look-up</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Look up,” “Take it easy,” and “Keep it real.” What do these phrases mean? Their literal meaning is
easy enough to grasp. But they are never used in the literal sense. They are touted as cures to our
collective ills; metaphors for the actual processes which would make everyone less cynical and more
attentive. I heard these phrases in the coda of an inane Hindi movie recently. The movie contained
generic drivel about young people: the improbably rich MBA graduate in her 20s, the extremely
hardworking gym trainer that luck does not favor, and the stand-up comedian who appears to be
happy-go-lucky but is in fact hiding a dark part of his past. These characters are “finding their
way” in the world; the typical plot of a “coming-of-age” movie. The lesson of this movie was to
convince everyone to put their phone in a (stupid and futile) bowl, “look up,” and take notice of
the world around them. One of the characters is told to stop stalking her ex-boyfriend on Instagram;
“I don’t know [why]; &lt;strong&gt;I can’t stop.”&lt;/strong&gt; It is ironic that it is this same character, a few minutes
later in the movie, who recommends “keeping it real.” What was the great revelation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been said about social media. This much we know: It makes everyone feel worse about
themselves; consume more; buy things they don’t need; idolize people they don’t know; envy those
that they do; and follow things that no one should spend any time on. Yet, Instagram and TikTok
remain popular (an understatement). 10 people sitting around a table in a restaurant, each staring
at their phones, is neither unfamiliar nor jarring. Every free moment is spent that way anyway. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not interested in the &lt;em&gt;generational answer.&lt;/em&gt; The one that begins with &lt;em&gt;“Hamare zamane mein,
…“&lt;/em&gt; (“In our time, …”) There was never a time when everyone did not complain about the young
people of their time. It is bad form to appreciate change, after all. Writing, telegraph, radio,
television, the Internet, email, and Whatsapp: Each brought a revolution that some adopted, most
ignored, and everyone had to live with. The time one waits for a response has changed; the person
waiting still remains unchanged. Do you agree?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many potential answers are left to consider. One of them is that the boredom and boundaries of
&lt;em&gt;ordinary&lt;/em&gt; life are much to strict, and that is what everyone is escaping in the digital worlds that
they inhabit all day. These tools provide access to facts that were never before assigned so much
value. What was once scoffed at as caprice is now applauded in the comments-sections as
spontaneity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The viewer’s insecurity is monetized by the “influencer.” In the ultimate portrayal of irony, the
selfsame Hindi movie which triggered this line of thought in me, has this prize line of dialogue in
response to the statement “She is an influencer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And who is she influencing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cursory look at the advertising industry suggests that advertising on the Internet is completely
ineffective and that the continued investment of &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt; money is a product of group think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort to jump the fence is further reinforced by innovations that keep us inside a larger,
encompassing fence. One where limitations are enforced by the service providers. The professional
reviewers have portrayed this as a willing trade-off of freedom for convenience. “Stay in the walled
garden, obey the platform’s guidelines, and everything will be great.” Have you heard that before?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone said this long ago: “The current iteration of technology has solutions for problems which
were created by the previous iteration.” The quest to build that single super-app is essentially
eternal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Own your devices; find your own (open-source) tools; build your own process; do not depend on the
whims of large companies;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the essential appeal of the digital world is its capacity not to distract us from the
present but to clench us in its maw. There is something hypnotic in its assurance that nothing
lies beyond the day’s serving of novel minutiae. To leave this world, even for an hour, is to
find yourself drifting uncertainly beyond the margins of the moment. Your mind begins to wander,
or else you find yourself slipping uneasily into the past.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Chronicle of Predominant Conversations (2023)</title>

   <updated>2023-11-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A large number of articles, opinion pieces, blog posts, video essays, podcasts, television dramas,
and movies saturate the information landscape. It is bad form to say that there is more out there
than can be read by any one person. The dreaded information overload has arrived. A few acknowledge
the existence of this swarm of multimedia. The majority beckon an Algorithm, entrusting it with the
responsibility of collecting, filtering, and sorting them in the unknowable order that each
component particle of the majority expects. Opting out is futile. Not knowing about something is
superior to not knowing about its &lt;em&gt;occurrence.&lt;/em&gt; What follows is a view of culture and society based
on the contents of 3 issues of the WIRED magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestions of openness are reduced to the realities of great coffee in the lobby in less than a
decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yet OpenAI &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; changed. The nonprofit board might technically be in charge, but virtually everyone
in the company is on the for-profit ledger. … It’s got product managers and engineers working
constantly on updates to its products, and every couple of weeks it seems to ping reporters with
demonstrations–just like other product-oriented Big Tech companies. I have visited virtually every
major tech company in Silicon Valley and beyond, and not one surpasses the coffee options in the
lobby of OpenAI’s headquarters in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Not to mention: It’s obvious that the “openness” embodied in the company’s name has shifted from the
radical transparency suggested at launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product companies have a bright future, if they focus on engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Roblox Connect, then, is an attempt to get people to just … hang out in Roblox, even when they’re
not gaming. Hanging out equals more engaged minutes; more engaged minutes leads to better
advertising opportunities and “bookings,” the purchase of virtual goods using Roblox’s digital
currency, Robux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and if that engagement is tied to &lt;em&gt;commercial information&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First of all, in search, people come looking for information. Over the past many years, you know,
how we present that has dramatically evolved. But we are still trying to help people find the best
information that exists online. Inherently, people are also looking for commercial information, and
ads are very valuable commercial information, because they connect merchants and businesses, small
and big, to users. None of that changes just because we are applying AI deeply. When we evolve
search with generative AI, we’ll apply the same principles. It’s important to us to connect users
with what’s out on the web, and we are working deeply to make sure that continues to work
well. … We want to make sure users are consuming those sites. So I don’t think the core part of
the experience will change. We will have a space for ads in a way that makes sense for users and
particularly on commercial queries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creation myths allow protagonists to enter closed restaurants and make small talk with staff after
they were &lt;em&gt;dropped off&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I arrived at a restaurant to meet Moore and tugged at the door. Locked–it was one minute before
opening. … When the hostess let me in, I gave her the reservation name. “The other guest is
already seated,” she said. … That was impossible. The restaurant wasn’t open yet. … “She’s been
here awhile,” she explained. … She’d been dropped off earlier and passed the time by making
conversation with the staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitions are changing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I am a good mother. I define motherhood in much broader terms than just giving birth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcast-ready essays read by AI-generated voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The 19-year-old speaks in the confident, podcast-ready tone of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who
sees the world in terms of problems to be solved, ending every other sentence with, “Right?”
Listening to him wax on about defensible moats and the “S-curve” of societal growth, it’s easy to
forget he can’t legally drink. But then, occasionally, he’ll say something that reveals the
wide-eyed undergrad, open to the world and still figuring out his place in it. Like the time he and
a friend walked around the Santa Monica pier until 3 am, “talking about what we value.” Semrai
thinks a lot about how to find balance and happiness. “I think, while I’m young, it probably lies
more in exploring the derivative,” he says, “chasing the highs and lows.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Profit still matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For a staunch advocate of the private sector, L also let slip flashes of exasperation at how
&lt;em&gt;corporate&lt;/em&gt; corporations can be. … Being on the same side of a war, it turned out, was no
assurance at all of being in sync.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/ukraine-russia-war-military-retail/&quot;&gt;In the War Against Russia, Some Ukrainians Carry AK-47s. Andrey Liscovich Carries a Shopping List | WIRED&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The masters spoke. They said, “AGI is not on the way.” No one was listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now, Microsoft has an exclusive license to commercialize OpenAI’s tech. And OpenAI also has
committed to use Microsoft’s cloud exclusively. In other words, without even taking its cut of
OpenAI’s profits (reportedly Microsoft gets 75 percent until its investment is paid back), Microsoft
gets to lock in one of the world’s most desirable new customers for its Azure web services. With
those rewards in sight, Microsoft wasn’t even bothered by the clause that demands reconsideration if
OpenAI achieves general artificial intelligence, whatever that is. “At that point,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/microsofts-satya-nadella-is-betting-everything-on-ai/&quot;&gt;says Nadella,&lt;/a&gt;
“all bets are off.” It might be the last invention of humanity, he notes, so we might have bigger
issues to consider once machines are smarter than we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimists have abandoned ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Artificial intelligence, cloning, genetic engineering, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/vr/&quot;&gt;virtual reality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/robots/&quot;&gt;robots&lt;/a&gt;, nanotechnology,
bio-hacking, space colonization, and autonomous machines are all likely coming, one way or
another. But we must take a stand and insist that human values are folded into the development of
each and every one of them.” Only a few years later, here he is rejecting not just these
technologies, but technology writ large as a solution to our problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans communicate to win esoteric games that simulate a world without bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the current Diplomacy metagame. Game theory calculations undergird most utterances, and even
humans communicate in code. Lerer joked that in modern-day online Diplomacy, even human players
wouldn’t pass the Turing test. Before Cicero, it seems, humans had already started playing like
AIs. Perhaps, for an AI to win at Diplomacy, Diplomacy had to become a less human game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing is still hard for the writers (apparently).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to Thomas Mann, “A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for
other people.” “You search, you break your heart, your back, your brain, and then–only then–it is
handed to you,” writes Annie Dillard in &lt;em&gt;The Writing Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things have not changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a subtle but meaningful distinction: Human writing may not be better, or more creative, or even
more original. But it will be human, which will matter to other humans.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Review - God, Human, Animal, Machine (O'Gieblyn)</title>

   <id>/2023/10/09/review-god-human-animal-machine-ogieblyn</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating:&lt;/strong&gt; 5/5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to read a book which would delve into the philosophical underpinnings of the ongoing AI
hype: &lt;strong&gt;What was the root of the idea that humans, with all their confusions and complexities, can
ever be replaced by computers?&lt;/strong&gt; O’Gieblyn’s column in the Wired magazine, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/cloud-support/&quot;&gt;Dear Cloud Support&lt;/a&gt;,
is my favorite part of the magazine. Her writing is lucid and her references come from far and
wide. I was not really prepared for the philosophical depth that is on display in this book:
O’Gieblyn goes to the very beginning of the world and starts with the earliest philosophers (Plato,
Aristotle) and ushers the reader through a series of “frames of mind.” She is not averse to religion
or science; nor is she biased to any particular philosopher or their ideas; quoting from a huge
variety of sources throughout the book to show the ways in which thinking has evolved. Her religious
upbringing and her current vocation as a technology writer feature heavily throughout the
book. After reading this book, I have a clear idea of where the foundation of the hype lies and how
it has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/25/1031432/what-is-mind-brain-body-connection/&quot;&gt;gotten&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/8q854v/elon-musk-simulated-universe-hypothesis&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_Algorithm&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;history-of-ideas&quot;&gt;History of Ideas&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ideas do not just come out of nowhere; they are genetic, geographical.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.133&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept that acts as the overture for this book is the Cartesian Partition: Descartes’ claim
that the body and the soul were separate, that the body was machine-like, whereas the soul was
responsible for “human characteristics,” symbolized by the internal experience, of a
person. Descartes did not say much about the soul, or why it was supposed to be responsible for this
internal experience. We can interpret this as his desire to analyze what he could and set aside what
was intractable. Descartes’ aim with the partition between mind and body was to refute the leading
theory of the time, Aristotle’s teleology, a doctrine which claims that ends are immanent in nature
(i.e. vitalism.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aristotle’s teleology enchants the world with vitality and “ends” which are inherent to the
object. (A stone falls to the ground because it is the nature of a stone to seek the center of the
Earth, and so on.) Descartes’ cold partition of ends from the interior position that they occupied
&lt;strong&gt;disenchanted&lt;/strong&gt; the world, and made it susceptible to analysis. While the “soul” side of Descartes’
partition remained intractable, it was still possible to analyze the “body” side of the
partition. This gives rise to modern science: Newtonian physics, computers, and information theory,
which holds that information is capable of existing alone without any physical form at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, the threads of thought get quite entangled. First, on the “soul” side of the partition,
there were attempts to resolve the hard problem of consciousness. There was Conway’s Panpsychism,
that consciousness is everywhere and not very unique to humans at all. Through Leibniz, this
philosophy undergoes a transformation and takes the mathematical form of the &lt;strong&gt;Integrated Information
Theory (IIT)&lt;/strong&gt; proposed by Goff and Tononi. The IIT proposes that consciousness is the result of a
physical system that has a high degree of integration. The similarities between IIT and Panpsychism
were not missed, because using IIT it is possible to prove that a small system of inactive logical
gates is conscious, even though that makes no sense. Here we sense a vulnerability which is now
being exploited by the peddlers of hype: &lt;strong&gt;No one is quite able to define what consciousness is or
what it enables or how to even identify it.&lt;/strong&gt; IIT remains widely contested and there is no agreement
about whether it is the “theory of everything of consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the “mind” side of the partition, things seem to be going swimmingly. From Newtonian physics, we
get many useful tools, the steam engine and computers being major among them. Newtonian physics’
focus on things (unsurprisingly) gives rise to &lt;strong&gt;Materialism&lt;/strong&gt;, the idea that matter is the
fundamental substance in nature and that everything springs from it. This was an idea that the
German philosopher Hegel was affected by. Marx and Engels began their theory of human history mainly
as a critique of materialism, ending up with a powerful criticism of Capitalism itself. Though, that
is a topic for another time. Modern materialism is also the root for other things such as
secularism, and alienation induced by modern economic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of materialism gives birth to the (frankly absurd) concept of &lt;strong&gt;Emergence&lt;/strong&gt;, the idea that
consciousness will emerge out of a system that is sufficiently similar to the human brain. O’Gieblyn
recounts experiments which test this: Scientists who make robots and wait for them to become
conscious. This was the most interesting part of the book for me. From the point of view of working
with computers, this seemed like an unhinged effort. Imagine a mother board with a basic CPU, main
memory, persistent memory, input devices without &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; software at all; i.e. Not even
firmware. While that is an electrical circuit through which current will flow in some predictable
manner, there is absolutely no way that the motherboard would behave anything like even the most
rudimentary computer. O’Gieblyn sharply points out the contradiction: Emergence comes from the
“body” side of the Cartesian partition, so, to claim that it in-turn gives rise to the “soul” side,
which was intentionally set aside, is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Materialism spawns other ideas too. &lt;strong&gt;Dualism&lt;/strong&gt;, succinctly summarized in the book as the idea that
“mind is software that is running on the brain’s hardware.” This one also assumes that whatever
the mind (or consciousness) is, must be part of the brain’s physical make-up and not something
outside of it at all. Another stray idea is the mechanistic brain, or “machines can be conscious
because consciousness is a mechanistic process, and we will figure out how to replicate it in
machines.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this apparent utopia with material on top does not continue for long: &lt;strong&gt;Challenges appeared&lt;/strong&gt;
from everywhere. Kierkegaard’s objection was that subjective experience is the only thing that
matters; and his philosophy, lightly touched on in the book, was almost completely told through the
first person without any affectation of a third-person point of view. Kierkegaard’s descendant is
the famous scientist Bohr, who compared physics and poetry, saying that poetry was the task of
creating images through the severely limited medium of languages, just as physics used languages and
systems of reason to describe the world in an approximate sense; never being able to grasp
everything at once. (Experts say that it is hard to classify Kierkegaard’s philosophy. So, I am not
sure on which side of the partition he put more emphasis. But a rough guess would be that he
preferred the soul far more than the body.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the “soul” side of the partition, Panpsychism gives way to &lt;strong&gt;Idealism&lt;/strong&gt;: the concept of a
single unified mind which is the universal substrate of every existing mind. There is no Archimedean
point, from which everything can be observed and commented upon. This concept also gives absolute
primacy to subjective experience because that is the only way of describing or learning more about
the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kierkegaard insisted on the value of subjective truth over objective systems of thought. Fear and
Trembling was in fact written to combat the Hegelian philosophy that was popular at the time, which
attempted to be a kind of theory of everything—a purely objective view of history that was rational
and impersonal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.133&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;metaphors&quot;&gt;Metaphors&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large part of this book is about metaphors and how they are abused. While we used to say that
computers process information like a brain does, now the metaphor is reversed and we hear sentences
like “I am still processing that information” or “What they said did not compute for me.” This
de-anthropomorphisation of human beings is insidious because it brings people and machines closer
together without clarifying why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeatedly, we see that what was a metaphor suddenly become the way things are talked about.  All of
science is a metaphorical way of explaining how things work to others and ourselves. However, if we
were to believe that science itself was not a metaphor describing how things are but the absolute
system which makes things the way they are, then we go down the slippery slope of granting more
primacy to a system of symbols over reality itself: making claims that information and ideas can
survive on their own forever without any subjective experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hype&quot;&gt;Hype&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember how the words consciousness and intelligence seemed to lack a clear definition? Everyone
was sure about what consciousness looked like (after all, we all have it); but no one was quite sure
how to recognize it in something that was not human, or maybe even inorganic altogether. This is the
vulnerability of the language which the con artists use to get into the news:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Such aspirations necessarily require expanding the definitions of terms that are usually understood
more narrowly. If “intelligence” means abstract thought, then it would be foolish to think that
plants are engaging in it. But if it means merely the ability to solve problems or adapt to a
particular environment, then it’s difficult to say that plants are not capable of intelligence. If
“consciousness” denotes self-awareness in the strongest sense of the word, then nobody would claim
that machines have this capacity. But if consciousness is simply awareness of one’s environment,
or–as has long been the case in artificial intelligence–the ability to behave in ways that appear
deliberate and intentional, then it becomes more difficult to insist on it as a phenomenon that is
unique to humans and other animals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.109&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is perhaps appropriate to mention the strange case of an engineer thinking that an AI system was
sentient. This engineer explicitly said that they were talking about sentience as a “priest” and not
as a “scientist” It seems hard to interpret that sentence: What is the difference between a priest
and a scientist? Is consciousness for one different from consciousness for the other? This latter
question we can answer with certainty: Yes, consciousness is different for every single person and
profession because there is no clear definition of it anywhere. But what about the former question
about their perceptions of consciousness. If a priest can claim that something is sentient, is that
a higher or lower bar of evidence than a scientist. This is the rub: Traditional modernity has
lionized Science to the point where the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; is capitalized; it would be foolish for a modern mind to
claim that the priest’s point of view was more valid than the Scientist’s. But sentience itself is a
concept so far removed from science, that it hardly matters what the profession of the person making
the claims is. This is the point which is always missed: Everyone focused on the credentials of the
person making the claim while the person making the claim was busy saying that they were not using
their credentials to make the claim in the first place. It is clear how this situation can be
quickly monetized for a modern audience that is not interested in the claim or the philosophical
backing of it. They see only the hype itself, and start sharing the story for its own sake; for the
absurdity that it represents, rather than for the truth content of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arendt was &lt;em&gt;quite concise&lt;/em&gt; in expressing this emotion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For Arendt, the problem was not that we kept creating things in our image; it was that we imbued
these artifacts with a kind of transcendent power. Rather than focusing on how to use science and
technology to improve the human condition, we had come to believe that our instruments could connect
us to higher truths.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.239, God, Human, Animal, Machine (O’Gieblyn, Meghan)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;empiricism-and-science&quot;&gt;Empiricism and Science&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empiricism is the bedrock of modern science. Empiricism is the claim that “more data will eventually
lead to more knowledge.” We can see that more data did &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; lead to more knowledge; if anything,
more data has lead to more buying and selling of goods and services.  Visualizing the data that
almost all technological platforms collect itself requires a bevy of software. Organizations that
collect user data are chaotic enough that companies claiming to help organizations “get their data
in control” have increased rapidly. We frequently talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-warehouse&quot;&gt;data warehouses&lt;/a&gt; now. The problem is no
longer the lack of data; it is the abundance of it. (There is a truism everyone is tried of
hearing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a lot of data did not necessarily lead to more knowledge. How about the scientific process? Was
that improved at least? No. Here, O’Gieblyn points out the most basic of insights: The whole point
of Science was to understand how things worked, how mechanisms could be explained; in a sentence, it
was to understand &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; an input (coal) could lead to an output (power). The more data we had about
the input, the output, and the process that happened in between, the more we could improve the
machine. Steam engines are far more efficient now than when they were first invented. A lot of that
was down to more data collection about the various factors which affect efficiency, mathematical
formulations about what leads to more efficiency, and experimental proofs that proved the
formulations right. This cycle is no longer in place anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every company that dabbles in the “product” business has a “data science” team. Using the most basic
statistical insights (namely, the test for statistical significance), these teams run A/B tests:
assigning users randomly to two different experiences and measuring which one makes them more
money. While the “sober” attitude towards testing is that there is a lot of “user research” which
tells the company what users want, and then the company runs an A/B test to confirm that what users
want is really what makes the company the most amount of money, the real attitude is quite
succinctly summarized in a couple sentences: “Who knows why people do what they do. They do it and
we can measure that with very high fidelity!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While normal A/B tests are still run by actual engineers and analysts who find insights in some
data, machine learning systems automate this process by setting a mathematical goal in the beginning
and letting the algorithm choose among several variants and find the best variant in a self-feeding
feedback loop. This is the nature of most recommendation algorithms that are used to decide which TV
show should be at the top of a on-demand movie streaming service, and which thumbnail should be used
for the TV show, with the goal to make the user click on the show and watch a few minutes of
it. This problem is exacerbated in opaque industries like &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/23/review-subprime-attention-crisis-hwang&quot;&gt;programmatic advertising&lt;/a&gt; where decisions
about which ad should be shown must be made within a fraction of a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;book-of-job&quot;&gt;Book of Job&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusions of this recommendation “algorithm” are to be accepted without questions about or
attempts to understand &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; they were reached. This approach is commonly called science, but as
O’Gieblyn neatly points out, is indistinguishable from the concept of an omniscient God. At the
beginning of the Protestant revolution, Calvin and Luther were priests who said that God was
radically other than human and it was futile to try to understand why God did what He did. &lt;strong&gt;It was
man’s duty to simply accept what was written in scripture and receive all knowledge as revelation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmc.com/blogs/machine-learning-interpretability-vs-explainability/&quot;&gt;ML explainability&lt;/a&gt; is a sign of the apparent inscrutability of systems which are being
built. However, the system which is used to explain the original system is itself independent of it
and a completely different algorithm which is only building a “narrative” about the decision, rather
than actually “looking inside.” Their inherent nature of being a faceless algorithm gives them a
veneer of neutrality and strong protection against any claims that they are unjust in some humanly
understandable way. The problem starts even before the system starts making decisions
(“inferences”):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Moreover, because the training data sets are so large, it’s hard to audit them to check for these
embedded biases. “A methodology that relies on datasets too large to document is therefore
inherently risky,” the researchers conclude. “While documentation allows for potential
accountability, […] undocumented training data perpetuates harm without recourse.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/&quot;&gt;We read the paper that forced Timnit Gebru out of Google. Here’s what it says. | MIT Technology
Review&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Retrieved:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;timestamp-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;timestamp&quot;&gt;[2023-10-09 Mon 16:09]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the system finally starts making predictions, its predictions can change behavior. Systems such
as Predictive Policing (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PredPol&lt;/code&gt;) were designed to anticipate the neighborhoods with the most
crime; instead, they ended up reinforcing their sample data and producing the very outcome they
predicted because when the police went to a locality hoping to find crime, they often found it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;before-the-cartesian-partition&quot;&gt;Before the Cartesian Partition&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At long last, one is convinced that Descartes’ thought experiment, which lead to the mind-body
partition, gave rise to modern science and modern hype. What came before it though? Here again
O’Gieblyn does not disappoint. She goes into the history of ideas before the partition, through the
lens of other philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plato’s philosophical system gave primacy to ideas and forms. The World of Forms was always
present and never changing; it was only in that world that the perfect form of an object
existed. There was a separate World of Matter where these objects existed, and they had a
part of the characteristics of the perfect form but they could never hope to be completely identical
to the perfect form which was unattainable. So, in Plato’s thinking, these “Universals” were
characteristics which were always present, always certain, and most importantly, “common” or
“generic.” These universals did not need to be proved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Loss of Universals came about in the Late Middle Ages (late 14th century), when suggestions
began that there was nothing universal or common about ideas at all, and that it was just the names
that we give to commonalities we perceive in objects. This was the Nominalist style of
thinking. Nominalism eventually found its way into the mainstream through Protestantism and
subsequently spawned the disenchantment and the scientific revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Blumenberg’s thesis, which has since been reiterated by a number of philosophers and historians, is
that nominalism, as it became widespread in Protestant theology, led to the Enlightenment,
disenchantment, and the scientific revolution. The trauma of lost universals created an intolerable
situation, one that reached the point of crisis in the thought experiments of Descartes, who so
mistrusted his own powers of reason that it was not inconceivable, he imagined, that God somehow
deceived him into thinking that a square had four sides or that two plus three equaled five.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.215&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another path down which we find our work-obsessed culture. Protestant theology encouraged a
work ethic which was powered by the anxiety of not knowing one’s predestination. (The concept of
predestination decreed that one’s destination after death, hell or heaven, has been decided and will
remain unaffected by one’s conduct during life.) Predestination, coupled with the Protestant concept
that work benefits the individual and society as a whole, transformed the nature of jobs themselves,
making it an obligation to consistently work diligently.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These conditions were perfect for the
rise of Industrial Capitalism, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24485.The_Right_to_Be_Lazy&quot;&gt;in which&lt;/a&gt; the harder people work for the same wage, the cheaper the
products that are produced, the lower their wages will soon be, and counter-intuitively the harder
they must work to earn the same wage as they did before.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Review - Subprime Attention Crisis (Hwang)</title>

   <id>/2023/07/23/review-subprime-attention-crisis-hwang</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating:&lt;/strong&gt; 4/5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would happen if all the free services that you use on the Internet, which are powered by
advertisements, stop being free one day?&lt;/strong&gt; This is the premise of the Subprime Attention Crisis. If
you ask yourself this, you might realize that many of the services that we think of as free are
powered by advertising. For me, the most frequently used services that are ostensible free are
Google Maps, WhatsApp and YouTube. I use at least one of them almost every day. If they were to
become paid services, or the hurdles to using them without giving up too much data increased, it
would be mildly annoying. This calculus will be very different for an Internet user who uses Gmail
and uses it to receive important communication. Hwang’s argument is sensible and easy to
understand. He starts from the basics of advertising on the Internet and builds up to his myriad
theses: Programmatic advertising is very similar to the financial markets. Ad networks claims that
targeted advertising on the Internet is better than “spray everyone” advertising on TV.  This claim
is a lie and that banner ads don’t really change consumer behavior. Commercial interruptions are
blocked by users using ad blocking plugins or because users reliably skip ads on video-only
platforms in under half a second. To back all of this, he presents a lot of industry research and
anecdotal evidence. This was a convincing case for being aware that free services could stop being
free any day, and there would be nothing really surprising about it. (Just the other day, YouTube
took a step &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/29/23778879/youtube-videos-disabling-ad-blockers-detection&quot;&gt;towards blocking ad blockers.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concrete examples are helpful to set the stage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gmail is a free, e-mail service that launched in 2004. In the past 19 years, it has grown rapidly
and now has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail&quot;&gt;1.5 billion active users&lt;/a&gt;. Gmail.com has become the most common e-mail domain. Gmail is
run by Google, a search engine company, which had a total revenue of $70 billion between January
and March 2023. &lt;strong&gt;78%&lt;/strong&gt; of this revenue came from Google’s advertising network.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Facebook (now Meta) is the company behind 3 of the most common messaging and social media apps
today: Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Facebook was launched in 2004, WhatsApp in 2009 and
Instagram in 2012. Both Facebook and Instagram are powered by ad revenue, while WhatsApp is a
popular end-to-end encrypted, ad free messaging platform. 3 billion people used at least one of
these apps in March 2023. Facebook’s total revenue between January and March 2023 was $28.6
billion. &lt;strong&gt;98%&lt;/strong&gt; of this revenue came from advertising.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-programmatic-advertising&quot;&gt;What is Programmatic Advertising?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmatic advertising is a marketplace with buyers and sellers. Publishers (like the New York
Times news website) sell space on their websites, where ads can be displayed. Buyers (like a local
business) buy this space to display an advertisement about the goods or services that they
provide. The commodity that is being traded (in the abstract) is the attention of the person viewing
the publisher’s web page. The process that decides &lt;strong&gt;which&lt;/strong&gt; ad should show up on a &lt;strong&gt;webpage&lt;/strong&gt; when a
user is visiting it is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://advertising.amazon.com/library/guides/real-time-bidding?ref_=a20m_us_blg_progadv_rtb&quot;&gt;Real-Time Bidding (RTB)&lt;/a&gt;. RTB is a sub-100ms auction where the buyers’
ad networks look at the data that is available about the user and decide how much they are willing
to pay to show a given ad to them. This process is easy to imagine when a few transactions are
happening in an hour. But the process happens at a much larger scale and is completely
automated. The technology behind it is probably complex, and (as Hwang demonstrates) publishers
often don’t even know which ad network served a given ad on their website.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;standardizing-the-marketplace&quot;&gt;Standardizing the Marketplace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one hiccup to setting up this marketplace. &lt;strong&gt;When exactly can we say that an ad has been
shown to the user?&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, when exactly has the user’s attention been &lt;strong&gt;captured&lt;/strong&gt;? This is
clearly hard to define. In a long news article, if the ad was displayed after the 10th paragraph but
the user stopped reading the article or clicked on another link after looking at the headline, the
ad was not viewed and the publisher should not be paid for placing an ad there. These things are
specific and explain what ads should look like and when they should be considered to be “delivered.”
I looked through the website of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), which sets these
standards to find 2 interesting examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ads that are delivered to a desktop web browser, ad measurement happens when the ad content has
been downloaded by the client and counted as delivered when it begins to render. The actual
guideline goes into excruciating detail and tries to define &lt;strong&gt;everything:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An Ad Impression across all display marketing channels is the measurement of responses from an ad
delivery system to an ad request from the user’s browser, which is filtered for invalid traffic and
is recorded at a point as late as possible in the process of delivery of the creative material to
the user’s browser. The ad must be loaded and at minimum begin to render in order to count it as a
valid ad impression. Measurement of begin to render should include logical components necessary to
display the ad, but does not necessarily include logical elements that are not essential (such as
other tracking elements)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Desktop-Display-Impression-Measurement-Guidelines-US-MMTF-Final-v1.1.pdf&quot;&gt;https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Desktop-Display-Impression-Measurement-Guidelines-US-MMTF-Final-v1.1.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (p.5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://iabtechlab.com/standards/podcast-measurement-guidelines/&quot;&gt;podcasts&lt;/a&gt; (an audio medium), there are two metrics. The first one measures whether the file
containing the ad was delivered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ad Delivered: an ad that was delivered as determined by server logs that show either all bytes of
the ad file were sent or the bytes representing the portion of the podcast file containing the ad
file was downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PodcastMeasurement_v2.1.pdf&quot;&gt;https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PodcastMeasurement_v2.1.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (p.16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the second one measures whether the podcast client can confirm that the ad was played:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Client-Confirmed Ad Play: counts an ad that was able to prompt a tracking beacon from the client
when the file was played. Whenever possible, metric should include information about how much of the
ad was played using the markers: ad start, first quartile (25%), midpoint (50%), third quartile
(75%), and complete (100%).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PodcastMeasurement_v2.1.pdf&quot;&gt;https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PodcastMeasurement_v2.1.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (p.16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like commodities trading, the attention that is being traded in these IAB standards is different
from the underlying “thing.” It has been standardized and defined in an effort to attain an
unattainable perfect commodification of the user’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-is-programmatic-advertising-different&quot;&gt;How is Programmatic Advertising Different?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertising is not a new concept. Newspapers have been funded by classified sections and outright
advertisements for at least a century. Hwang identifies 3 things that are different about
programmatic advertising:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;speed&lt;/strong&gt; at which advertisers decide whether or not to serve an ad to a user on a webpage is
much faster than before. Before buying an ad on a television show, or a newspaper, ad buyers
would generally do months of research about viewership/readership data. This data was not perfect
either, but the time that these decisions took was much longer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;volume&lt;/strong&gt; of ads that are served to users per minute has increased. On TV, a 30 minute program
has 22 minutes of content and 8 minutes of advertisements. Online, a single news article which
one would read in about 5 minutes can have 2 banner advertisments. Video streaming platforms are
worse with 30 second advertisements for videos which are less than 5 minutes long in some
cases. There is no way to say &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; exactly the volume has increased. But the lack of this
data should not prevent us from noticing that the number of ads we see on a daily basis has
skyrocketed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;granularity&lt;/strong&gt; with which ads can be placed within a piece of content has increased. A
newspaper has a given section for Classifieds, magazines assign pages or the back cover for
advertisements, and TV shows demarcate content and advertisements very clearly. (“Mute the
commercials, will you?”) Online, where ads are placed can be controlled right down to the
paragraphs between which the ad shows up or the section of a video in which the ad would be most
effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;similarities-to-finance&quot;&gt;Similarities to Finance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The executives who were building advertising on the early Internet and trying to figure out how to
make these new services profitable were from the finance world. &lt;strong&gt;For e.g.,&lt;/strong&gt; Sheryl Sandberg, widely
regarded as the person who was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2022/06/02/sheryl-sandbergs-advertising-jackpot-facebook&quot;&gt;responsible&lt;/a&gt; for teaching small businesses to use programmatic
advertising, had a background at the World Bank and the United States Treasury. The model that they
chose to replicate for programmatic advertising was the one of high-frequency trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important similarity is &lt;strong&gt;market opacity.&lt;/strong&gt; When the commodity that is being traded is not
well understood or its value is misunderstood by market participants, a crisis of confidence is
always looming around the corner. This is what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghuram_Rajan&quot;&gt;Raghuram Rajan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6372440-this-time-is-different&quot;&gt;Reinhart&lt;/a&gt; have both argued are the
prerequisites for the creation of a bubble in any economy. The crisis of confidence will trigger the
boom/bust cycle as in the financial markets, as marketers realize that the money they spend on
programmatic advertising is not delivering the returns that they were promised and stop spending as
much. One question here is &lt;strong&gt;whether&lt;/strong&gt; the old markets of advertising (television, radio) were not
just as opaque? Of course, they were opaque too. However, the marketing that was done on TV or radio
did not claim to be targeted or very good at anything except raising brand awareness in the first
place. A famous ad industry adage is “Half of the money I spend advertising my product is
wasted. But I don’t know which half.” The opacity in the market was accepted as a
condition. Programmatic advertising makes unattainable claims about being targeted and measurable;
while simultaneously, publishers are not sure which ad network is delivering what ads to their
users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another similarity that Hwang talks about is the “private market.” Companies like Facebook and
Google have premium ad space which is sold on private markets. This limits the information available
in the public market, and makes it hard for advertisers to figure out how much a given webpage is
really worth paying for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-bubble-in-the-attention-economy&quot;&gt;A Bubble in The Attention Economy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;ads don’t work.&lt;/strong&gt; When WIRED, one of the early websites, ran a banner ad, 40% of people who
saw it clicked the ad. Today, even 1% is a pipe dream, with the average being about 0.2-0.4% of
viewers engaging with ads. One way to evade this critique is by saying that advertisers are doing
“brand advertising.” Brand advertising simply focuses on showing people brand names and products and
does not aim for any change in behavior at all. This allows advertisers to make the duplicitous
claim that programmatic advertising works at increasing brand awareness, without measuring anything
or changing anybody’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;ad blocking is on the rise.&lt;/strong&gt; Google admitted in 2014 that 56% of ads that were displayed
are never seen by a human. 800 million devices had ad blocking enabled in 2022. The demographic
trend is also discouraging for advertisers: Younger users and wealthier users use ad blockers at a
disproportionately high rate. In this section, Hwang reveals another stunning fact that makes total
sense once you read it: Snapchat’s users skip commercial interruptions within less than a
second. &lt;strong&gt;Less than a second.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Snapchat’s users skew younger and are clearly &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; ad-averse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, &lt;strong&gt;click farms&lt;/strong&gt; inflate the value of advertisement in some domains. There are also the more
technical problems of domain spoofing, where unreliable and obscure ad networks sell an add on the
domain &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NYTemis.com&lt;/code&gt;, but brand it as one that is going to appear on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NYTimes.com&lt;/code&gt;. Buyers and
publishers are not able to detect this behavior, and the technical solutions which prevent such
domain spoofing when visiting websites is still not available when buying ad space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, &lt;strong&gt;middlemen.&lt;/strong&gt; There are resellers and middlemen who add a markup for no value at all. The
marketing agencies which used to be premium places for creating ads have lost ground in that area,
but they are active in this market of procuring discounted ad space from the ad networks, adding a
mark up, and reselling the space to some buyer. These middlemen get a commission on the ad space
that is bought and are completely disconnected from any effect of whether the ad actually changes
consumer behavior. (Does this sound vaguely familiar? In the movie The Big Short (2015), about the
2008 financial crisis, these middlemen are the mortgage brokers in Florida who were selling condos
by giving subprime loans to anyone with a pulse, and pocketing the commissions on these loans.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
The middlemen brag about the loans as “NINJA loans: No Income No Job” and talk about how the bonuses
on these loans started skyrocketing a few years ago. In fact, Steve Carrel’s character asks them the
very question that Hwang complains that no one is asking in the programmatic advertising business:
“Do people have any idea what they are buying?”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that Hwang writes, the similarities between the financial markets and the advertising
market, and the time before the crisis in the financial market and now in the advertising market,
become quite clear. The whole book is obsessed with bringing these similarities out and showing
what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What Next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is an advertisement supposed to do? Ignoring the amorphous category of “brand advertising,” all
of advertising has the same goal: &lt;strong&gt;Change the viewer’s behavior in a predefined, intended way.&lt;/strong&gt; The
online attention economy is based on the confidence that ads on the Internet, bought through ad
networks and sold through real-time bidding, are more effective than old-school, “spray everybody”
advertising. A crisis of confidence will happen when buyers stop advertising through this method and
realize that it does not affect their bottom line adversely at all. Buyers and sellers have already
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/business/chase-ads-youtube-fake-news-offensive-videos.html&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloombergmedia.com/press/shifting-to-an-audience-first-mentality/&quot;&gt;doing&lt;/a&gt; this&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and they are not seeing their revenues drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ways that we use the Internet are constrained to the mediums in which advertising can spread:
text with engagement signals like “Like” and “Favorite”; quantifiable popularity metrics like
follower and subscriber counts. A place that enables computers to connect to each other without
commodifying everything that people do in that place does not necessarily have to look like our
current Internet. &lt;strong&gt;The way that the Internet is funded is important to the way that the Internet
is.&lt;/strong&gt; The algorithms put inflammatory posts that make people mad at the top of their feeds because
that is what sells advertisements and motivates people to take action. Hwang’s optimism is touching
here: He says that the Internet had other routes; it could have relied on other sources of
revenue. I believe him. People could have run their own servers if the technology had been simple or
if the education ministries had kept up with the technology. Long-form blogs would have been the
order of the day, rather than “outrage of the hour” sentences. People would have found it harder to
target others because interaction was curated and disperse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should care about how the programmatic advertising market works because it is the main source of
funding for many free services today. This article links to a few YouTube videos and news articles,
which remain free because YouTube and publishers have ads on their website, which they believe is
making them enough money that they don’t want to stop people from just sharing links around. If that
wasn’t the case, how would you share video clips with everyone? Hosting is not free, and neither is
bandwidth. The collapse of this market would change the Internet completely. And possibly, for the
better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep returning to Hwang’s premise for this book. &lt;strong&gt;What would happen if all the free services that
you use on the Internet, most of which are powered by advertisements, stop being free one day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Total revenue: $69,787 million. Revenue from Google advertising was $54,661 million. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Facebook’s financial results for January-March 2023 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/Meta-03-31-2023-Exhibit-99-1-FINAL-v2.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF, p.10&lt;/a&gt;). Total revenue: $28,645 million. Revenue from advertising was $28,101 million. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This was quite clear during the YouTube Adpocalypse scandal when YouTube was struggling to control ads that were being displayed next to content that was affecting “Brand safety,” the concept of surfacing brand names next to agreeable content. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I could not really believe this fact, so I dug up the article where this fact was sourced from: “Advertisers and media partners familiar with the company’s thinking say serious consideration is being given to such a plan, which would help solve a nagging flaw in Snapchat’s business: its young users often skip commercial interruptions within less than a second.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/1A72A#selection-3203.0-3203.265&quot;&gt;Snapchat May Force Users to Watch Three Seconds of Ads Before Skipping - AdAge&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hwang mentions the New York Times moving away from programmatic advertising, and other examples in the book, but I have not put references to those here. I found 2 interesting examples for ad buyers and sellers: &lt;strong&gt;First, JP Morgan Chase,&lt;/strong&gt; the consumer banking devision of the large investment bank JP Morgan: “Of the 400,000 web addresses JPMorgan’s ads showed up on in a recent 30-day period, said Ms. Lemkau, only 12,000, or 3 percent, led to activity beyond an impression. An intern then manually clicked on each of those addresses to ensure that the websites were ones the company wanted to advertise on. About 7,000 of them were not, winnowing the group to 5,000. The shift has been easier to execute than expected, Ms. Lemkau said, even as some in the industry warned the company that it risked missing out on audience ‘reach’ and efficiency.” from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/business/chase-ads-youtube-fake-news-offensive-videos.html&quot;&gt;Chase Had Ads on 400,000 Sites. Then on Just 5,000. Same Results.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Second, Bloomberg,&lt;/strong&gt; a major publisher of financial news, stopped open-market programmatic advertising. They moved to the time tested strategy of asking buyers to work directly with their media team to place ads. The stated reason for this was the performance of their website. Notably, Bloomberg shut down their ad sales despite seeing the revenues from this business grow for more than 2 consecutive years. “Starting January 1, 2023, Bloomberg Media will no longer allow third parties to sell ads to our audience through open-market third-party programmatic, or other non-direct sold “demand channels,” across our website and apps. Going forward, if brands want to reach our audience, they’ll need to work directly with our world class media team.” – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloombergmedia.com/press/shifting-to-an-audience-first-mentality/&quot;&gt;Shifting to an Audience-First Mentality - Bloomberg Media&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New Wireguard Peer in 10 Minutes</title>
   <link href="/2023/07/22/updated-wireguard-setup"/>
   <updated>2023-07-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2023/07/22/updated-wireguard-setup</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been using Wireguard for about &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/12/22/wireguard-on-linux&quot;&gt;4 years now&lt;/a&gt;. I started with the basic Wireguard setup, where I
did everything manually and used the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ip link&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ip addr&lt;/code&gt; commands to create new links and assign
addresses to them. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wg-quick&lt;/code&gt; utility is open-source and has built-in SystemD support. So, I
switched to using the configuration file that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wg-quick&lt;/code&gt; requires. With an ad-blocking DNS server, I
was able to use the setup for a long time without having to change anything at all. The client
support was excellent on Linux, Android and (even) iOS. I never really noticed whether I had my VPN
enabled. I kept it enabled at all times except when I needed to access some geofenced
service. However, I was still writing the wg-quick configuration files manually and most of them
were very similar. This caused me to put off adding new peers to my network as soon as I needed to.
Recently, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/wireguard-configuration-generator/&quot;&gt;a Golang CLI tool&lt;/a&gt; which generates &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wg-quick&lt;/code&gt; compatible configurations for
Wireguard peers, based on a simple JSON input file. Using this tool, I was able to add a new
Wireguard peer and create a new network in less than 10 minutes. The path to that CLI tool is what
this post is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wireguard is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; simple.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Literally and conceptually. Literally, it is less than 4000 lines of
code. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/11/27/266&quot;&gt;original patch&lt;/a&gt; that added the VPN to the Linux kernel is very small and I have always
wanted to read it, although I have never been able to because knowledge about the Linux kernel
networking stack is a prerequisite. Conceptually, it can be explained with a single slide. A
rudimentary understanding of Linux syscalls is sufficient to understand this slide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/wireguard-concept-slide.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireguard.com/presentations/#october-21-2016-codeblue-tokyo-japan&quot;&gt;Wireguard Presentation - October 21, 2016 - Codeblue, Tokyo, Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all of this simplicity, the wg-quick configuration to establish a traditional VPN is also very
simple: It is about 10 lines of code that needs to be on every machine that is part of the VPN, and
the 2 main differences between configuration files were the ASCII keypairs that are used to identify
peers inside a network, and whether it is on the server (the peer which will forward all the traffic
towards the Internet) or the client (the set of peers which will send traffic to the server asking
it to forward it to the Internet). The configuration is so small that no tool is distributed to
generate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/Wireguard-Configuration-Generator-Schematic.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have 2 main devices: a computer and a phone. I was able to connect them to 2 VPN servers with a
total of 6 configuration files. The key pairs for each pair among the 3 servers for 2 different
networks was different (intentionally); so when I was originally setting this up, I made some
mistakes while copying the keys and pasting them around, and it took me a couple tries to get the
setup right. Once I got the setup right, I did not bother to change it for 2 years. After that, I
had some new requirements which this manual setup did not meet: I wanted to add new clients and new
servers quickly, because I expected the number of clients to grow and I did not want to manage the
keys manually anymore. As each peer had a single private key inside each network, and the public key
could be derived from the private key, this only meant that I needed some sort of persistent map
between 2 keys: network and client name and 1 string value: the Wireguard private key. JSON or YAML
files are perfect for this and building a system which reads the file and writes configuration files
to disk would be ideal and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more advantages of this setup was that, all of these configurations were just files. There is
no need to introduce a new tool to manage them. If your hard drive is already encrypted, you can
just keep the files as-is on disk, and as long as you are able to boot your computer, the file will
always be available. If you want to keep the file on some sort of cloud storage but encrypt it
end-to-end, then you could easily use &lt;a href=&quot;https://dyne.org/software/tomb/&quot;&gt;GNU Tomb&lt;/a&gt; to create an image file, that is internally a
LUKS-container, with an ext4 filesystem, and upload this image file to the cloud storage
system. Most cloud storage systems have good integration with the Gnome Files or Nautilus
applications, so syncing the files is not manual and the status of syncing can be checked easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not get around to implementing all of this until last month, when I realized that one of my
new devices did not have a VPN setup and I had been avoiding any use of the device that required a
VPN. I did not want this pattern to continue.  I wanted to be able to introduce new clients and
servers easily and without having to think too much, so I got around to writing a single-file Go
program which would use a JSON file as input and generate configuration files on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/wireguard-configuration-generator&quot;&gt;icyflame/wireguard-configuration-generator&lt;/a&gt;. It is not a single file application
anymore, and I ended up adding some convenience features. My favorite one is the input file
validator. The JSON file itself is quite small and you can probably read the whole thing in one
glance, however, when adding a new peer, you have to ensure that the IP address that you assign it
is unique. So, the tool will automatically read the whole file and ensure that it makes sense: That
each peer inside a given network has a unique IP address and that the names of the peers inside a
network are unique so that the files can be properly named.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are many great talks about Wireguard by the author, zx2c4. I recommend this one: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88GyLoZbDNw&quot;&gt;WireGuard: Next Generation Secure Network Tunnel - YouTube&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Conversion from HTML to ePub Format</title>
   <link href="/2023/06/17/better-epub-files"/>
   <updated>2023-06-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2023/06/17/better-epub-files</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have taken to reading magazine articles and long newsletter posts on my Kindle by
converting them to the ePub format, rather than reading them on the computer, where the process of
making highlights and taking notes differs from the process that I use for all the e-books that I
read. As I started doing this for some long articles (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;), I realized that the best
online options out there are not good enough. I have been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://dotepub.com/&quot;&gt;dotepub.com&lt;/a&gt; which seems popular and
converts to both the generic Epub format, and the Kindle-specific Mobi format. While it does a good
job with all the text, this particular article was particularly heavy on images, and all the images
were required to understand the text. When I converted the page to an Epub format, it told me that
it would not include all the images from the article. So, I set out to write a few scripts which
could fix that problem and actually export web pages as self-contained epub files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aside:&lt;/em&gt; You can skip this explanation and directly read the scripts &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/html-to-epub&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dotepub’s hesitation to download all the images, and then include them in the epub file, is probably
an attempt to restrict the amount of bandwidth that is consumed by each user. As a user-facing
service, where the developer would have to spend quite some time to prevent abuse, I understand
that. While the epub file &lt;strong&gt;will certainly&lt;/strong&gt; get bigger when you include all the images from an
article, I doubt that anyone on a broadband connection will mind that. And they have &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt; loaded
all the images locally on their computer once. Downloading an Epub container with the same images
might be something that they explicitly want to do (and that’s why they are using dotepub in the
first place.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before converting the raw HTML of the webpage into an Epub file though, it is important to
understand the structure of the Epub file itself. And to do this, I checked out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackhat.com/eu-21/briefings/schedule/#how-your-e-book-might-be-reading-you-exploiting-epub-reading-systems-24898&quot;&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt; from the
BlackHat Europe 2021 conference (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixSZyuPsXNU&quot;&gt;Talk video&lt;/a&gt;). The talk has a clear explanation of what an Epub file
is (just a set of HTML, JS, CSS. Sound familiar?), what are its common constituents (some manifests
files that point to various locations with the data, the images), and the engines that ePub readers
use to render the content of ePub files. After this, I looked at some of the real world ePub files
that one can download from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gutenberg.org/&quot;&gt;Project Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt; to see how these are implemented in practice. I was
pleasantly surprised to see that the XML manifest itself was short, easy to understand, and
well-documented; and that it had very few &lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt; fields; with most of the fields being
optional. I guess eBook readers have to work with a huge variety of files so they impose the least
amount of constraints possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time, I also found out about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/readability&quot;&gt;Readability&lt;/a&gt; library, the library that is used by
Firefox to generate their excellent “Reader view” for pages with a lot of text. I wanted to use this
library because it would give me a cleaner, more ebook friendly version of the text that is
generally on webpages. Most magazine websites have sidebars, headers, and footers with links to
other articles or sections. All of these would just be distracting on an ereader device, which is
designed to take a blob of text and render it in a pleasant way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify&quot;&gt;DOMPurify&lt;/a&gt; library, which sanitizes HTML and removes any cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerabilities from HTML. This is important because, as mentioned in the Blackhat talk, e-readers
&lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; have the ability to run JavaScript. Even though my Kindle is not connected to a network most of
the time, it is still possible that the JavaScript that is part of these HTML pages reaches out to
external services (like Analytics.) I don’t want these external requests to be made from my Kindle;
an environment which does not have the convenience of installing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ublockorigin.com/&quot;&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt; extension.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experimented with some methods of downloading the webpage. I tried to download the HTML, and other
associated resources (CSS, images) manually, using some Node.js/Go code. I gave up on this approach
pretty quickly, because I realized that I was just re-implementing what every browser’s rendering
engine already does well. Then, I used the “Save” feature built into Firefox. This feature is very
good and works well when you want to save just the images on a page. But it did not work well to
create an exact copy of the page, because many of the resources that were referred to on the webpage
could be served from another domain (such as a webpage &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example.com/article&lt;/code&gt; which downloads static
images, CSS and JavaScript from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;static.example.com&lt;/code&gt;.) This is a common pattern and followed by many
websites. So, consider that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example.com/article&lt;/code&gt; refers to 2 images &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example.com/images/first.png&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;static.example.com/images/second.png&lt;/code&gt;. On saving the webpage, the first path would be changed
to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/images/first.png&lt;/code&gt; and rendered properly. However, the second path would be left untouched by
Firefox. So, the simple Save feature did not work either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My third attempt worked well: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFileZ&quot;&gt;SingleFileZ&lt;/a&gt;. SingleFileZ is a browser extension which allows you to
download all the resources that are required to render a webpage as a zip archive which contains an
HTML file and its associated resources. The paths to the resources are also appropriately
changed. As SingleFileZ attempts to create a copy of the webpage that will work without any network
connection, it downloads everything, renames those files, and prepares a new HTML file which is
completely self-sufficient. (It simply does not care about which domain the resource originally came
from.) Also, files are neatly arranged based on their type; i.e. images are all put inside a single
folder. This extension is really useful even if you plan to just re-read magazine articles directly
on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After downloading the HTML, and putting it through DOMPurify and Readability, I planned to use
Pandoc (inside a Docker container) to convert the resulting HTML file into an Epub file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these three pieces, the only part left was to write some Node.js code to deal with the HTML and
some Bash script which would invoke these tools in the correct order. This was fairly simple. One of
the hiccups that I ran into along the way was that the HTML that is produced by many websites is not
valid (i.e. some closing tags are omitted). Pandoc expects strict HTML as input. So, I had to
convert from HTML to XHTML using Pandoc once, and then convert from XHTML to Epub in the second
step. This worked well and produced very readable Epub files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; shortcomings in the process. The most glaring one is that there is no cover
image for the Epub files that are generated. Although we have all the images from the webpage,
deciding which one should be the cover image would require manual intervention. For now, I use the
Kindle’s Library List view which shows the title of the books as a list, rather than the (visually
pleasing) Covers view, which shows a bookshelf with book covers arranged on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/html-to-epub/blob/master/batch-html-to-epub.sh&quot;&gt;Scripts on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I know why this extension is not a default on all browsers: because it will hurt the bottom lines of the companies making the browsers, which also &lt;em&gt;happen&lt;/em&gt; to be running, by complete coincidence, the biggest advertisements networks.

   <title>Review - Darkness at Noon (Koestler)</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating:&lt;/strong&gt; 5/5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This novel starts off with an imprisoned protagonist thinking of the past where the prisoner was
part of the very Revolution that has now imprisoned them. As the story progresses, philosophical
ramblings come at increasingly frequent intervals and the novel reveals the most valuable plot
point: watching the protagonist go back and forth between the belief that the “Revolution” was a
good thing, which will eventually attain its original goals; and the belief that the Revolution was
incorrect to say that “an individual is the product of one million divided by one million.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other dystopia tell us about the villain well before the book starts: No one thinks what Big Brother
does in 1984 is doing &lt;strong&gt;could be remotely&lt;/strong&gt; good. No one thinks that burning books in Fahrenheit 451
is the logical thing. The outcome is framed, forcefully and without any shred of doubt, as an
aberration; a mistake. The author is trying to get the reader to realize the absurdity of the
situation and the mistakes in reasoning that lead to it. While reading Darkness at Noon though, this
is not always clear. I am fairly convinced that the Revolution did not actually change anything in
this fictional world and that had it not happened nothing significant would have been lost. However,
we get to see the present through Rubashov’s eyes, and Rubashov himself was deeply involved in
creating the Revolution and putting No. 1 in power. So, when Rubashov explains the reason for the
way things were done during the Revolution, it is clear (to us and to Rubashov himself) &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;
Rubashov himself has now been imprisoned by No. 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story starts off with the protagonist of this novel, Rubashov, switching relentlessly between
the present and the past. It took me some time to understand what was going on, whose story this is,
where we were. I managed to piece together most of this by p.70. But then, from p.73 to p.76,
Koestler has another character read Rubashov’s full biography. Nevertheless, this part of the book
was fun. So, one thing I will say is this: *Do not obsess over the specifics of where the revolution
is happening, what Rubashov’s exact role was, how No. 1 came to power, what happened to the old
leader, etc.* These are mostly peripheral to the main question of the plot: *Should Rubashov
participate in his own self-sacrifice for the sake of the Revolution? Or should he “die in silence”
and betray the Revolutionary cause, which has become increasingly unclear to him?* Just as Rubashov
was instrumental in the death of a union member who believed the Party’s ideals &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt;, now
No. 1 has come to him and asked for his head. Should Rubashov acquiesce?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the course of the hearings, we see that Rubashov thinks everything out to the logical
conclusion: He concludes that “the Party can never be mistaken.” He decides to confess to the
charges that are laid upon him, under considerable duress, and agrees to go to a public trial. The
tactics used on him are (ironically) the same that worked on common peasants: sleep deprivation,
constant interrogation with brief periods of rest of a couple hours at most, a fluid set of charges
that are applied on him and updated on the fly depending on what &lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt; confesses to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he also ignores some key flaws in his thinking: He says that he is acting honorably, and that to
act with honor is to “be useful without vanity.” From the descriptions of what No. 1 did to his
opponents or is now doing to Rubashov himself, it is clear that No. 1’s primary characteristic &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;
his vanity. There is no honor in what No. 1 is doing. He has lied to his population that Rubashov is
a traitor to the Revolution; and he has lied to Rubashov (indirectly) that the population &lt;strong&gt;needs&lt;/strong&gt; a
traitor in order to be invigorated about the Revolution; that there will be a war soon and to give
them a public trial is the only way to reinforce their true belief (or at least, weed out more
“traitors”). No one benefits except No. 1, who stays in power perennially, through the application
of this devious logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final thing is about revolutions themselves. The book only lightly touches on this point, but it
felt &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; insightful to me. Rubashov was a part of the original Revolution; he was fighting
against economic fatality; he was applying philosophy to problems in order to get the population to
revolt against Capitalism. The generation after the Revolution’s founders are also ostensibly doing
the same thing; however, there is one key difference: &lt;strong&gt;They have never seen the world before the
Revolution.&lt;/strong&gt; In essence, they have no idea what they are rebelling against. They were born when the
world had already been transformed violently; and now, they knew nothing about the transformation or
how the world was before the transformation.  This breaks the whole setup: The Revolution is reduced
to nothing more than a “mythical event” which is used to keep things going the same way as they
currently are; to retain power within the same centers and the same people. There is no possibility
for any true “Revolution” which remains both true to its original goals and in constant flux. For
the original goals will soon be forgotten. And the flux that overthrew the old ruling class to put
the new one in place, if allowed to continue, might be used to throw out the new ruling class and
put an even newer one in its place.  This is the ultimate logical wrench in the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rubashov is unable to find any way to pull the wrench out. But he is hopeful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Rubashov thought] Soon it would be over. But when he asked himself, For what actually are you
dying? he found no answer. It was a mistake in the system; perhaps it lay in the precept which until
now he had held to be incontestable, in whose name he had sacrificed others and was himself being
sacrificed: in the precept, that the end justifies the means. It was this sentence which had killed
the great fraternity of the Revolution and made them all run amuck. What had he once written in his
diary? ‘We have thrown overboard all conventions, our sole guiding principle is that of consequent
logica; we are sailing without ethical ballast.’ Perhaps the heart of the evil lay there. Perhaps it
did not suit mankind to sail without ballast. And perhaps reason alone was a defective compass,
which led one on such a winding, twisted course that the goal finally disappeared in the
mist. Perhaps now would come the time of great darkness. Perhaps later, much later, the new movement
would arise – with new flags, a new spirit knowing of both: of economic fatality and the ‘oceanic
sense’. Perhaps the members of the new party will wear monks’ cowls, and preach that only purity of
means can justify the ends. Perhaps they will teach that the tenet is wrong which says that a man is
the product of one million divided by one million, and will introduce a new kind of artithmetic
based on multiplication: on the joining of a million individuals to form a new entity which no
longer an amorphous mass, will develop a consciousness and an individuality of its own, with an
‘oceanic feeling’ increased a million fold, in unlimited yet self-contained space.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Better Personal Data Management</title>
   <link href="/2023/04/08/better-personal-data-management"/>
   <updated>2023-04-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2023/04/08/better-personal-data-management</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I switched from Ubuntu 22.04 to Debian 11 earlier this year. I was using Ubuntu’s LTS OS versions
for nearly 9 years before that, since 2014. The switch to Debian was because I stopped liking what
Ubuntu had done with the OS: The GUI has become a strange mix of Ubuntu’s old desktop environment
(Unity) and the Gnome Desktop Environment, which is standard and popular. I generally use the i3
window manager, so the Desktop environment was not &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; annoying; I could have lived with it if not
for Snaps. The introduction and use of Snaps was a continuous thorn in my setup. Each snap sets up a
new loop file.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So, the output of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; is polluted with these strange loop devices that I don’t
care about. Also, Firefox installed using Snaps does not work well with the KeepassXC Browser
integration. So, the &lt;em&gt;recommended&lt;/em&gt; way for installing programs on Ubuntu was actively getting in my
way. (There is also some Ubuntu bloatware but an equivalent of that is there in almost every other
non-base distribution, so it can’t really be counted against any single distribution.) I wanted to
do a few things differently with this reinstall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;frequent-os-version-updates&quot;&gt;Frequent OS Version Updates&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 9 years of using Ubuntu, I used only 3 LTS versions. I was hoping that I would not have to go
through the OS installation process multiple times, which would save me a bunch of time to learn and
set it up properly each time. But this approach was wrong. Every time that I thought I would not
have to install the OS again for at least 5 years, my plans were thwarted and I had to install the
OS within 3 years or less. This was due to first, a new laptop, then a crashed HDD, then a new
laptop, then a glass of water spilled on my (spill-proof) laptop keyboard, and finally, another new
laptop (a cheap replacement for the one that I ruined.).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So, now my target is to update to the
latest version of the OS every year. Of course, it comes with recent Linux Kernel versions, but also
ensures that I am on the latest version of most packages. (I had a lot of problems running Ubuntu
16.04 LTS on my old laptop, barely 1 year after its end of life, because a lot of the packages that
I needed were not being packaged for that version of the OS at all. So, I had to manually build a
&lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of things. And each of those things had its own dependencies, which were also not packaged for
older versions of the OS, … and so on.)  Also, the increased speed that comes from running the
latest software on a very old device is stunning. After upgrading from Ubuntu 16.04 (released 2016)
to Ubuntu 22.04 (released 2022) on a 9 year old i5 Dell Inspiron machine, the computer became
usable. It was totally fine for the normal mix of writing / reading / Netflix / YouTube. The laptop
has a hard drive, which I suspect caused the fans to spin up when I was streaming video, but
everything else worked well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;decouple-data-from-the-os&quot;&gt;Decouple Data from the OS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regrettably, until a few days ago, I was blasé about managing my data properly. There were a bunch
of folders, with a lot of files, and they were all &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; required, but I never really knew which
external hard drive to check for what files. Backups were not regular or complete. I used Dropbox
for some use-cases, but not for others (which doesn’t make much sense.) It isn’t like this approach
had not &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; caused me problems: I have accidentally deleted and (through a painful process)
recovered a folder containing all my files from college &lt;strong&gt;twice&lt;/strong&gt;, and both times because I was
&lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to get all this data under control, but I was doing it with the incorrect &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;
command. On my computer, I was used to putting all my files inside the home directory. There were a
few files scattered around in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/code&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/personal&lt;/code&gt;. It was really an unmoderated (and
embarrassing) shit show. Linux provides the elegant concept of partitions. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/boot&lt;/code&gt; partition
consists of your kernel and things that should be kept in plaintext, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/ (root)&lt;/code&gt; partition
consists your OS files and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/var&lt;/code&gt; etc: These should be the things required to
login. Finally, there is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; partition which consists of things that you would use &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt;
after logging in: SSH and GPG keys, configurations for your software, your shell configuration,
personal files, etc. You should be able to reinstall your OS by changing &lt;strong&gt;just&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/boot&lt;/code&gt; and the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/ (root)&lt;/code&gt; partitions. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; partition can be left untouched by a new OS installation, and
should work seamlessly with the next version of the OS. I am going to better implement data
management by using various partitions, and ensuring that all of them are encrypted properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;encryption&quot;&gt;Encryption&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, every time I thought my computer was &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;basically&lt;/span&gt; indestructible (why did I
think this?) and that I will not run into a situation where I would have to give it to someone else
unlocked, I had to give it someone unlocked. The technicians who service your laptop will
undoubtedly ask for the password of a user on the system. This is &lt;strong&gt;unavoidable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The correct way (if there is one?) would be to have a “Support” account with a documented password
on all your computers, and keep it free of any personal files and ensure that if you have to hand
your PC to someone else and let them connect to WiFi or inspect the PC’s configuration, they can do
so without having access to your files. Even this might not be good enough, because some times they
might want to do things which require the administrator’s password, and the administrator password
often gives them access to your files as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to really get around this is to keep the files required to start your computer separate
from your personal stuff. Once again, a separate encrypted partition that you manually mount on
login seems like the best answer here. The overhead of mounting the partition on each login &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;
tedious, but this can be gotten around by using the TPM or a FIDO device. (Note that if you use your
TPM, which is very convenient, then the support technician can technically use the TPM To also mount
your devices because the TPM doesn’t check if &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; are the one who is mounting the device.) Using a
FIDO device (YubiKey) is better, but inconvenient because you have to keep the device close to your
computer. YubiKey does manufacture low profile FIDO keys which take up one USB port and stay
connected to your device, but can be conveniently disconnected before handing the laptop unlocked
and over to someone else. That might be a good balance. I am still figuring this out. The trade-off
between convenience is security is not a novel debate at all. (The most popular operating system,
Windows, gets around it using Bitlocker, which will keep the security key in your TPM and keep a
recovery key on Microsoft servers. You can never lose your key and its &lt;strong&gt;super&lt;/strong&gt; convenient, but
Microsoft will have a copy of your key.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;dont-forget-how-to-install-operating-systems&quot;&gt;Don’t Forget How to Install Operating Systems&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is controversial and I have had different feelings about it over the past few years. For a
while, I loved configuration and tweaking and changing my setup constantly. (The very beginning of
my journey with Linux was just installing and uninstalling operating systems on an old
Windows desktop machine, crossing my fingers, pressing the power button, and hoping that the
computer boots up properly.) Then, for a long time after that (pretty much until the accident with
my laptop last year), I craved stability and the same OS version throughout. Now, I am back on the
configuration/tweaking part of the cycle, but I don’t want to configure for the sake of configuring.
I want to &lt;strong&gt;build&lt;/strong&gt; a configuration which makes it easy to configure in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the approach that one would take with an editor like Vim or Emacs: There is a
period of intense configuration when you first adopt the editor. But later, things cool down and
there is much less to configure and the time spent using the editor far outweighs the time spent
configuring it. (One of the efforts with my latest install is that I am using Ansible, a
configuration management system that I am familiar with, for doing almost all the installation and
building that is required. This is already paying dividends, because I can run this
Ansible on a new computer, and get all my software and configuration back. I was surprised at how
easy it was to write the initial Ansible configuration, which is the most daunting. The incremental
updates to the configuration have been quite easy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing about installing operating systems on your &lt;strong&gt;main&lt;/strong&gt; computer is that if you don’t know how
to do it well enough, you will almost definitely be scared about doing it and keep postponing
it. With the limited time that I get, I want to use my computer to do something &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;; not configure
it to do something &lt;strong&gt;later.&lt;/strong&gt; However, there is a point where this logic gets inverted: You keep
putting away installing a new operating system. So, you keep forgetting the things you learned to do
when you installed an operating system the last time around. Eventually, you end up starting from
the beginning and spending &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; more time installing an operating system than you saved by putting
off the installation. I am pretty sure this is the spiral I fell into when I was installing Ubuntu
22.04 after a 4 year hiatus from OS installation on my backup computer last year. The process took
nearly 4 days, including all the basic setup, and was quite manual. Compared to that, the Debian
installation last month was quick and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;understand-the-boot-process&quot;&gt;Understand the Boot Process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not knowing what &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/crypttab&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt; do, or how to add a new LUKS device, or how to
remove a partition from being mounted at start-up, or how to remove the password from one of the
LUKS keyslots, etc: These are intricate things that it is &lt;strong&gt;not OK&lt;/strong&gt; to get wrong (because you would
not be able to boot properly if you got them wrong.)  However, they are also not done frequently
enough for you to remember everything. Then, you must rely on your personal notes from the last time
you did something (The Zettelkasten system has helped a lot to keep my notes synchronized.) and the
learned experience from the last time that you did it. Right now, the past few weeks of
configuration updating is fresh in my head. So, I can update the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;crypttab&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fstab&lt;/code&gt; file or use
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cryptsetup {open,close,luksFormat,luksDump}&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;umount&lt;/code&gt; commands, without much
hesitation. This was not the case when I originally installed Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on my backup laptop
or when I installed Debian 11 on my current laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;manage-your-data-yourself&quot;&gt;Manage Your Data Yourself&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one might seem like I am fighting the tide of the tide of the “Cloud” here. It is not &lt;strong&gt;at all&lt;/strong&gt;
absurd though: You need to build a system, and this takes time and admittedly inconvenient. But once
you have it, and start refining it, you can rest easy in the knowledge that your data stays quite
close to you and will never cost you more money because the company providing the Cloud decided it
was a good time to increase prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take photos for example. They are quite important. When I first set about arranging my photo library
early last year, I found that I had taken a lot of photos using various phones that were still stuck
on those phones. I had never thought about moving everything over to some central place before, so
photos from 2018 were in the phone I used then. Photos from 2019 were in the iPhone I am currently
using without any backup. (I don’t use iCloud Photos, so they were stored in &lt;strong&gt;just one place.&lt;/strong&gt;) I
know of people who lost a lot of their photos because their phone just refused to start up one
day. The helplessness and regret that follows losing important data is &lt;strong&gt;neither&lt;/strong&gt; worth the effort
required to build a system to manage data yourselves, &lt;strong&gt;nor&lt;/strong&gt; is it worth saving the money you would
pay Google Photos or iCloud, if you are not interested in building your own system. Let’s go back to
the start: photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you take photos with your phone? If yes, do you back up these photos? I have found that there are
two answers to this question: The first one is “Yes, I use {iCloud/Google Photos/Dropbox} to backup
my photos.” The second one is “No, I don’t backup my photos. Why do I need to? What is going to
happen to my phone anyway?” I have found that &lt;strong&gt;something always happens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When something does
happen, but &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; fixable, you go to the support center. And the first thing that
the support person is going to ask you to do is unlock the phone and hand it over to them. This
happened both when I gave my Nexus 5X for its motherboard to be replaced and when I went to an Apple
Store to get an iPhone’s broken display changed.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There &lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt; be the option to not give them
your password, and instead ask the
support people to just format everything on your phone. You can’t do this if you have photos on the
phone that you want to recover. The good faith assumptions about support people not looking at your
personal data notwithstanding, do you really want to hand over your unlocked phone with several
years worth of personal digital data about you, your friends, and your family to someone else? I
don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I use Shotwell to store and manage my photo library.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This applies to other parts of your
digital life as well: Passwords, scanned data (documents like your passport), email. Taming the data
that is created as during my life is worthy of its own blog post. I will probably do at least one
about email and photos, because those two have been the most interesting exercise for me. During
these, I have run into the strange patterns that keep repeating in managing data, the amazing
ability that comes about from thinking of everything as a file, the use of GNU tools like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;comm&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sha256sum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there it is. My rationale for switching from Ubuntu to Debian, and my rationale for frequently
updating your operating system through a controlled process, forcing you to automate as much of the
setup as possible. The tools are there and all of them are well-integrated into the Debian and
Debian-based distributions.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; All you have to do is build your own system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Loop files are setup using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;losetup&lt;/code&gt;, and allow you to treat a simple file on your filesystem as a block device and do things with it that you would generally only do with a hard drive (which is seen as a block device.) So, you could set up a LUKS container inside a simple file, by setting it up as a loop file, creating a LUKS container on it, then creating a partition table inside it and multiple partitions inside that partition. All of this works because Linux is super strict with abstraction. For me, loop files, and their implementation in Linux, is sort of the pinnacle of great software design. The manual page for &lt;a href=&quot;https://linux.die.net/man/8/losetup&quot;&gt;losetup&lt;/a&gt;, the command used to set up loop files, is informative and easy to read. Something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dyne.org/software/tomb/&quot;&gt;Tomb&lt;/a&gt; is possible only because of loop files. It is not supported on Mac OS because … well, of course anything useful would never exist on Mac OS. (I am forced to use a Macbook at work because of better Mobile Device Management support for that operating system, and MDM is a prerequisite for most IT teams: it allows them to control the company’s data and wipe the hard disk remotely if something happens to the laptop.) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This happened in September 2022, and it was a &lt;em&gt;soul crushing&lt;/em&gt; incident. It overtook my previous “I ruined my electronic device and I can blame only myself” incident from 3 years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If nothing has happened to you, that’s great. But it doesn’t hurt to be prepared, and that’s what I am evangelizing here. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Now, I have no idea &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; this is required: Surely, changing the display has nothing to do with the software itself. But I have no idea how these devices work either, so I am not going to second guess the professionals. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The process is convoluted, but definitely worth it. I copy HEIC files from iPhone to Windows through the Windows Photos app; then convert them from HEIC to JPEG using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copytrans.net/copytransheic/&quot;&gt;CopyTrans HEIC&lt;/a&gt;; and then, import them into Shotwell. Transferring photos from a digital camera into Shotwell is &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; simple: Connect the camera to your computer, open Shotwell, and click “Import All.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I did not use the cryptsetup CLI tool once when setting up encrypted partitions because the Disks utility on Debian (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gnome-disks&lt;/code&gt;) works well with LUKS1. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Review - The Book of Form and Emptiness (Ozeki)</title>
   <link href="/2023/03/31/review-book-of-form-and-emptiness"/>
   <updated>2023-03-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2023/03/31/review-book-of-form-and-emptiness</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating:&lt;/strong&gt; 4/5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ozeki’s novel is good at the beginning and good at the end. The middle drags on for a little too
long; I had at least a mild interest in figuring out how the characters end up. However, the
interest levels get &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt; low. It is a book about books, art, culture, the decline of reading,
the increase of consumerism, capitalism, and the incredibly high number of &lt;strong&gt;things&lt;/strong&gt; that are now a
fixture in the lives of a few people. It is a portrayal of the present, as a dystopia, by a Book;
that shows both the ability to buy things that jobs give people, and the precarious nature of those
jobs in a society with no safety net. The novel is mostly sincere, but sometimes it crosses over
into the cheesy. The novel has a character whose background is identical to Marie Kondo and whose
philosophy is very similar (I guess) to Ozeki’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable thing about this novel is probably the way that it is narrated. It has a character,
the Book, which narrates the Boy’s story. And sometimes, the Boy chimes in and converses with the
Book. The Marie Kondo character, Aikon, sometimes narrates her experience. The parts where the Book
talks about itself, or about other books, are a &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;bit&lt;/span&gt; cringe-y. It is a mixture of moral panic and
cliches. It is hard to tell if this was an intentional choice. Here is a sample:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This state-of-the-art mechanical, computerized book-sorting system was installed as part of the
renovation, and the books were beside themselves with loathing. They longed for human hands, for
human touch. They bristled with ire at the indignity of their situation as they were spun, flipped,
rotated, scanned, sorted, sent sliding down rackety gravity chutes into bins or hoisted
hydraulically onto trolleys. It was more than any book could bear, and their lamentations rose above
the clamor of the machines—We are not units! We, who once were sacred, next to God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ozeki’s book is really about Capitalism and Consumerism, the unlimited desire for things and the
economic system that manufactures everything dirt cheap and then convinces everyone that they need
this suddenly cheap stuff to stay at the top of a completely made up hierarchy. One of the homeless
people that Benny hangs out with is German (a stand-in for Marx, perhaps?) and theorizes quite a bit
(sometimes boringly). There is some purely theoretical, interesting rambling from another character:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s the fucking world we live in. It’s capitalism that’s crazy. It’s neoliberalism, and
materialism, and our fucked-up consumer culture that’s crazy. It’s the fucking meritocracy that
tells you that feeling sad is wrong and it’s your fault if you’re broken, but hey, capitalism can
fix you! Just take these miracle pills and go shopping and buy yourself some new shit! It’s the
doctors and shrinks and corporate medicine and Big Pharma, making billions of dollars telling us
we’re crazy and then peddling us their so-called cures. That’s fucking crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… but the most interesting part is the empathetic way in which Ozeki portrays the disgusting
consumerism of her characters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;She [Benny’s mother] went back to the computer, typed in $50, and then sat back, feeling
relieved. It was a bit of insurance. So as long as her maximum was the highest, she would still
win. 3:59. Less than a minute left. She began to count down, and then, with only twenty seconds to
go, the bid jumped to $32.45. And then it jumped again, and again! Not one, but two snipers were
bidding on her Hansel and Gretel! She held her breath and crossed her fingers and counted–five,
four, three, two . . . The Congratulations, You’ve Won! message popped on to her screen, along with
her winning bid. $49.45. She sat back in her chair, triumphant. It felt so good to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benny’s mother is a hoarder who is living in a house with a lot of things. She keeps buying things
that she has no need for: books, craft supplies, snow globes. She keeps archives of old newspapers,
from her job, inside the house. She doesn’t take out the trash. The picture of the house that is
painted is &lt;strong&gt;astonishing,&lt;/strong&gt; not very different from some of the worst kept houses that you would see
on “tidying up” TV shows like Marie Kondo’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Marie Kondo: Aikon is a Zen monk who is &lt;em&gt;basically&lt;/em&gt; Marie Kondo, and also a stand-in for
Ozeki’s voice of reason and (one presumes) beliefs. The similarity between Kondo and this character
in the book is quite stunning. They both write a book, tell people how to fold clothes, arrange
things, their books become a sensation in America, they star in an American TV show. Ozeki’s
portrayal of Aikon does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; feel lazy as a result though, because we never get inside Marie
Kondo’s mind in her shows. Aikon comes at the “problem of too many things” from a completely
different mindset: That mindset is refreshing. She lists the things that Ozeki talks about in this
book as things that her producers asked her not to talk about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of course, the solution was quite simple: people just had to stop buying so much stuff, but when she
mentioned this on a recent call with the American producers, their response was less than
enthusiastic, and later they followed up with a memo, asking her not to talk about topics like that
on the pilot. When Kimi [Aikon’s assistant] inquired what they meant by “topics like that,” they
sent her a list: consumerism, capitalism, materialism, commodity fetishism, online shopping, and
credit card debt. Speaking critically of such topics was un-American, they explained. American
viewers wanted proactive solutions. Not buying was not proactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final notable characteristic of the novel is the fact that things “speak.” They express
themselves by hissing or shouting or creating a ruckus. They are silent when they are well cared
for. And Benny is the only one who is able to listen to them. &lt;strong&gt;That&lt;/strong&gt; is a pretty good idea. Benny is
meticulously clean and organized. Undoubtedly, Benny is the hero, the ideal to aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had not thought about things expressing themselves; I was assigning some feelings to them but not
assigning a voice to them. (I have not looked at things as “just things” for quite some time
now. Most of things I have I classify as tools, and been grateful about the ways in which they have
made doing something easier.) The framework of thinking about things &lt;strong&gt;wanting&lt;/strong&gt; care from their
owners is powerful: It gets you to think about &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;what&lt;/span&gt; a thing’s ideal state would be: why you should
fold socks properly, why you should empty your bag each night. This &lt;strong&gt;deep respect&lt;/strong&gt; for things and an
acknowledgment of the role that they serve is important to me. By looking at tools as status symbols
(“Do you have the latest iPhone?”) or just things to be “used and discarded” (“The headphones are
around here, &lt;em&gt;somewhere.&lt;/em&gt;”) diminishes them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a very touching recollection of Aikon’s experiences working on relief efforts after the
2011-03-11 earthquake in Japan. I have lived in Japan for 4 years now, and I know that the 3.11
earthquake features prominently in the collective imagination of everyone who experienced that
horrible disaster. The reminder that Japan is disaster-prone is everywhere: yearly drills, letters
from the local government, news articles about disasters in other parts of Japan. But it is quite
easy to believe that surely, &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; would not be affected by it. One must remain on guard against
that complacency, as long as they live in Japan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This was another important lesson in the impermanence of all things. Japan lies in a seismically
active zone, so earthquakes are not uncommon. Disaster can strike at any moment, but we forget this,
distracted by the bright, shiny comforts of our everyday lives. Wrapped in a false sense of
security, we fall asleep, and in this dream, our life passes. The earthquake shook us awake, and the
tsunami washed away our delusions. It caused us to question our values and our attachment to
material possessions. When everything I think of as mine–my belongings, my family, my life–can be
swept away in an instant, I have to ask myself, What is real? The wave reminded us that impermanence
is real. This is waking up to our true nature. Already broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other notable quotes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aikon talks about her book becoming a sensation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why was it that women could never work hard enough to quiet their nagging fear that they were not
enough? That they were falling behind? That they could and should be better? No wonder they wanted
simple rules to govern the way T-shirts should be folded, children raised, careers managed, lives
lived. They needed to believe there was a right way and a wrong way–there had to be! Because if
there was a right way, then perhaps they could find it, and if they found it and learned the rules,
then all the pieces of their lives would fall into place and they would be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benny’s father talks about the moon landing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was 1969, and I was very young boy and worrying because in Japan, we have a fairy tale about a
rabbit who lives on the moon, and I was afraid about the big American astronaut will hurt the moon
rabbit. But everybody told me don’t worry! American astronaut is very kind man. He won’t hurt any
moon rabbits! But still I was worrying.” “But it was okay, right?” “It was okay. We watched on the
old black-and-white TV set because we have no Internets back then. Then we see the first astronaut,
Mr. Neil Armstrong, go down the ladder to the moon and say some famous words–One small footstep for
a man. One big jump for everybody else. Something like that. You know those words? Very famous.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Notes and Review - Lost Daughter (Ferrante)</title>
   <link href="/2023/03/29/review-lost-daughter-ferrante"/>
   <updated>2023-03-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2023/03/29/review-lost-daughter-ferrante</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating:&lt;/strong&gt; 5/5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One should never arrive in an unknown place at night, everything is undefined, every object is
easily exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a beautiful line. Every time I am booking a ticket to some new place, I remember this
line. I remember the dread and uncertainty of arriving at night. Despite &lt;strong&gt;knowing&lt;/strong&gt; that arriving at
night is unwise, I arrived in Italy late one night in 2019. It was a timely reminder of my lack of
wisdom; a line like this makes the lesson a memorable one. Seeing the confused characters in this
book, my first instinct was to clamp down on their inability to decide and brand it rashly as
immature indecisiveness; then, &lt;em&gt;gradually,&lt;/em&gt; I would see the lens fog up and doubt creep in. Were
they really indecisive, or do they appear unclear to us only in hindsight?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was like a slight twinge that, as you keep thinking about it, becomes an unbearable pain. I was
beginning to feel exasperated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched the movie adaptation before reading the book. The movie was great. Dark and ominous right
to the last scene, the unstated parts of the movie were exquisite; the setting was great and I felt
the irritation caused by Nina’s family to Leda and Nina’s inexplicable presence among them. The
first thing I noticed about the book was that all the characters are mothers, daughters, or
soon-to-be mothers. Leda has 2 daughters Marca and Bianca. Leda talks often about her own
mother. Nina has a daughter Elena. Elena thinks that her doll is her daughter, and she calls her
various names. Nina’s sister-in-law is pregnant and expecting her first child. The doll is lost for
a brief period of time; indeed, that is the central thread in the story. The doll is lost, and a
long time later, it is found. During the intervening time, things get confusing. Leda is curious
despite herself. She claims to have brought books and claims to want to read them, but she can’t
take her eyes off Elena and Nina. Undoubtedly, Elena reminds her of herself: the young Leda; the
unfulfilled scholar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one incident that haunts her is leaving her daughters for three years. She pursues the language
of her scholarship, English. (There is an inversion in the setting of the movie and the book. In the
book, Leda is an Italian woman and a scholar of the English language. In the movie, the situation is
reversed: Leda is English and a scholar of the Italian language.) Recounting her experience of
leaving her daughters, she thinks up this memorable paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After a while I heard a light knocking. Bianca came in, very serious, followed by her sister,
timidly. Bianca took on orange from the tray of fruit, opened a drawer, handed me a knife. I didn’t
understand, I was running after my own desires, I couldn’t wait to escape that house, forget it and
forget everything. Make a snake for us, she asked then, for herself and Marta, too, and Marta smiled
at me encouragingly. They sat in front of me waiting, they assumed the poses of cool and elegant
little ladies, in their new dresses. All right, I said, took the orange, began to cut the peel. The
children stared at me. I felt their gazes longing to tame me, but more brilliant was the brightness
of the life outside them, new colors, new bodies, new intelligence, a language to possess finally as
if it were my true language, and nothing, nothing that seemed to me reconcilable with that domestic
space from which they stared at me in expectation. Ah, to make them invisible, to no longer hear the
demands of their flesh as commands more pressing, more powerful than those which came from mine. I
finished peeling the orange and I left. From that moment, for three years, I didn’t see or hear them
at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The touching scene of separation is all the more jarring for we see her in the present, being
treated coldly by her daughters, and we see the drive in her to continue her study. She doesn’t
understand why she left them, and so she instinctively did not talk about it with her daughters. At
the very beginning of the book, we encounter this sentence which explains why all she can do about
this is write letters to her daughters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the origin was a gesture of mine that made no sense, and which, precisely because it was
senseless, I immediately decided not to speak of to anyone. The hardest things to talk about are the
ones we ourselves can’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If leaving did not make sense, why did she return? We get only the faintest of hints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Nina asks] “If you felt good why did you go back?”  I [Leda] chose my words carefully. “Because I
realized that I wasn’t capable of creating anything of my own that could truly equal them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is the driving force of this novel: characters who do not reveal &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;much;&lt;/span&gt; characters who would
rather speak in cliches and through letters; characters who talk about their own confusions. They
remain shrouded in a veil and we get rare glimpses into what they really care about. Why should we
get any clarity about what these characters want, when we can’t get that kind of clarity with anyone
else? Why should we get any clarity about what they want, when we can’t even be sure that we can get
that clarity with &lt;strong&gt;ourselves?&lt;/strong&gt; Ferrante is soothing and brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other memorable quotes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s what I was, superficial. And then that remark: children are always cause for worry. Said to a
woman about to bring one into the world: how stupid. Always words of contempt, skeptical or
ironic. Bianca had cried to me once between her tears: you always think you’re best. And Marta: why
did you have us if all you do is complain about us? Fragments of words, mere syllables. The moment
arrives when your children say to you with unhappy rage, why did you give me life: I walked absorbed
in thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>The Unstoppable March of Technology</title>
   <link href="/2023/02/18/unstoppable-march-of-technology"/>
   <updated>2023-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2023/02/18/unstoppable-march-of-technology</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every conversation that I have been in over the past 3 weeks outside the home has been about
generative AI, and the vein of all these conversations is quite similar. Most of the people I met
are optimistic about this new “technological advancement.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I met a few skeptics who believe
that generative AI is adept at generating only a summary of what’s already out there and incapable
of coming up with something original.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I agree with those skeptics, based on the screenshots
that abound on Twitter and my brief experience giving a handful of prompts to ChatGPT. The apparent
inevitability of the “next thing” in technology is can not be understood as one that stems from
rational thought: Rather, it is a cultural (almost religious) belief, and it pervades in the social
psyche. For a while now, there has been this unstated acceptance that new technologies will come
along, and those who don’t use them will be left behind in the dust. What if one were to ask the
question, what if the dust is good enough? One wouldn’t even think of it; when has dust ever been
“good enough”?. Is the cutting edge really something you want to be on? You better want to be there,
or you will be left behind. Even if you are standing still on the travelator of technological
advancements, you will be pulled along, dragging and screaming, on the unstoppable march of
technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; hard to keep up with the news. I don’t read much of it anymore. Many times, I don’t
know the topic that has been debated on &lt;strong&gt;all the&lt;/strong&gt; newsletters for the past 3 days. I don’t feel like
I miss many things. I find out about these things eventually, and most of the time, I am
underwhelmed by what I find out. So, I have decided to not keep up with the news and instead spend
my time on long form magazine articles, non-fiction books that try to guess where things went
wrong&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and novels that have nothing to do with the present. But even this level of
disconnection did not save me from finding out about the recent advances in generative AI
technology: Large language models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the goal of AI scientists was to make something that was sentient and could think
and do things like a human being. Some AI scientists thought the creation of such an AI system was
inevitable, so they started working on the problem of ensuring that these AI systems (which will
undoubtedly be created, &lt;strong&gt;duh.&lt;/strong&gt;) don’t end up adversely affecting humans. Such an AI system does not
exist yet. However, AI technology has come a long way: It can now write a mediocre essay about any
topic, which is probably plagiarizing 100s of great essays and millions of mediocre essays on the
same topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature of this generative AI craze has been that it can write individual, isolated
functions in programming languages for things like integrating a spreadsheet with some other tool or
for connecting to the API of a service and automating some task, which was being performed
manually. This feature is probably not very scary to most software engineers; nevertheless, let me
say it aloud just once: &lt;strong&gt;Most engineers are not writing isolated functions.&lt;/strong&gt; Their everyday task
involves making sense of the myriad ways things are done at their workplace, and figuring out a way
to make the technological stack a little bit easier to understand, while convincing a large retinue
of coworkers that what they are doing actually makes things easier. Further, this kind of
“duct-taping” between spreadsheets and some other tool is only necessary because most people agree
that the tools that they use daily at work are terrible in general and particularly bad at achieving
their primary function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative AI can also create some images. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/picture-limitless-creativity-ai-image-generators/&quot;&gt;Wired magazine&lt;/a&gt; thinks that these images are better than
“art created by most humans.” They declared that generative AI now has “lowercase creativity.”  I
think this claim is wrong. AI art is AI art; not “human” art. There is no “authority” who can decide
what is “real” art and what isn’t. So, whatever each viewer decides goes. For me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/super-chess-paul-klee/MwHvy-HH4O6BGw&quot;&gt;a painting by Klee&lt;/a&gt;
or that of a minion by my niece is still objectively and incomparably better than the images
generated by a computer program. Despite all the dressing up of AI as some “magical system,” it is
just a computer program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/picture-limitless-creativity-ai-image-generators/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about “AI’s ability to generate images that are better than art by
most humans” is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; content with this &lt;em&gt;bizarre&lt;/em&gt; and monumental claim. Somewhere in the middle, and
completely out of nowhere, the author starts talking about how in the future you could generate 3D
images, then use that to create a world in the metaverse and then walk through it with your VR
headset. (You might notice that all the terms used in the previous sentence were coined in the 90s
and entered the public’s psyche less than a year ago, when one company decided to change their name,
and make one of those terms the central theme of their &lt;strong&gt;future&lt;/strong&gt; businesses.) A simpler reading of
the article is that it was written by somebody who has one foot in the door of every single hype
train that is leaving the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once, there were letters and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQuUN1HGa0c&quot;&gt;we used to wait&lt;/a&gt;. Then, there was the telegraph. Then, radio, television
(Idiot Box), computer, the Internet (Revolutionary), smartphones, social media (Anxiety), connected
people, and connected homes (Internet of Things). Every technology brought along some problems which
were fixed by the next &lt;em&gt;advancement&lt;/em&gt;. No one stopped to think whether the adoption of each
technological advancement was necessary; whether it introduced more problems than it solved; whether
this march of technology was &lt;strong&gt;really inevitable&lt;/strong&gt; and whether it was really a march &lt;strong&gt;forward.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freud noticed this early:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Freud once pointed out that new technologies merely solve problems created by other technologies. To
the common refrain that without the telephone, we’d be unable to hear the voices of our adult
children who live hundreds of miles away, he replied, “If there had been no railway to conquer
distances, my child would never have left his native town and I should need no telephone to hear his
voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neil Postman, a social critic from the 1980s, spoke about it too:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To be unaware that a technology comes equipped with a program for social change, to maintain that
technology is neutral, to make the assumption that technology is always a friend to culture is
stupidity plain and simple. Moreover, we have seen enough by now to know that technological changes
in our modes of communication are even more ideology-laden than changes in our modes of
transportation. Introduce the alphabet to a culture and you change its cognitive habits, its social
relations, its notions of community, history and religion. Introduce the printing press with movable
type, and you do the same. Introduce speed-of-light transmission of images and you make a cultural
revolution. Without a vote. Without polemics. Without guerrilla resistance. Here is ideology, pure
if not serene. Here is ideology without words, and all the more powerful for their absence. All that
is required to make it stick is a population that devoutly believes in the inevitability of
progress.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.158, Amusing Ourselves to Death (Postman)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;It is interesting that the change has been characterized as an advancement even before it is completely clear what the change really even is. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This undoubtedly depends on what you mean by “original,” on which there is considerable debate. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I found this quote on 2023-04-29 when I was re-reading Postman’s book “Amusing Ourselves to Death.” Postman used the same word, “inevitable,” as I had chosen to use in the opening paragraph of this post. I am glad to find out that others share the frustration that I feel when people talk about “unavoidable technological progress.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What To Do With All This Media Theory?</title>
   <link href="/2022/12/10/what-to-do-with-media-theory"/>
   <updated>2022-12-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/12/10/what-to-do-with-media-theory</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of media theory talk over the past year in the mainstream (newspapers, news
websites, television) and on the intellectual sidelines (podcasts and blogs). The discourse is heavy
on the origins and consequences of the continuing, effectively unstoppable, decay of communication
over traditional media. (Savvy authors might use terms like “signal to noise ratio.”) However, all
this discourse is suspiciously devoid of any advice for us, the spectators. Repeatedly, there is the
defeatist assertion that most people will &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; be addicted to their screens despite knowing
how the screens manipulate them. I don’t think this defeatism is necessary. What should people do to
avoid the consequences that authors are expounding on? Should they try to cut their information
intake? Should they go “off the grid,” a concept that Opinion writers have made a cottage industry
out of talking about?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The discourse has no response. Here’s my non-defeatist take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-rant&quot;&gt;A Rant&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise of this whole post is that current media theory doesn’t offer solutions or even
lighthearted pointers towards a better way to use our tools and consume media. In fact, the most one
can &lt;strong&gt;probably&lt;/strong&gt; get from it is that we are in a transition period and we shouldn’t worry because
everything will get sorted out, by someone, somehow, at some vague point in the future. That advice
is not good enough. My belief is that theory and discourse should not merely theorize about reality;
it should put forth recommendations for readers about the methods for applying realizations in
real-life. And the action has to happen &lt;strong&gt;now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before presenting the defeatist examples, let me say outright that the people giving the defeatist
takes are the most informed on the subjects and I respect their work, because I have learn most of
what I know from their work. Disclaimer aside, a couple examples of the defeatist takes from people
who talk about media:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a lot of us, most of us, maybe are going to and do spend a lot of time staring at a screen, skimming
with distractions everywhere&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--quoteend--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I began reading the novel I’m now close to finishing, it was difficult for me to get lost in the
story. When I do read something that is intellectually demanding, I find my mind wandering from the
page after only a few moments. I assume that by now this is just how most people feel about reading
and that some may not even know that there is any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/reading-as-counter-practice?publication_id=6980&amp;amp;post_id=87673987&amp;amp;isFreemail=true&quot;&gt;Reading As Counter-Practice - by L. M. Sacasas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--quoteend--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the internet is as transformative a technology as the printing press, and I think it’s certainly
comparable, then it’s going to take several decades to fully adjust to the changes it has wrought.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-sean-illing.html&quot;&gt;Transcript: Ezra Klein Interviews Sean Illing - The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing this post after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/22/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-maryanne-wolf.html&quot;&gt;listening&lt;/a&gt; to Maryanne Wolf on The Ezra Klein Show. Wolf is
eloquent throughout the show, and she spoke with the zeal and enthusiasm of a real ideologue. She
really believes in her work, and her work was magnificently revealing about the ways our reading
habits on screens and on paper are intertwined with each other. As I mentioned above, the ways in
which parents’ addiction to screens affects children is another part of the conversation where her
expertise shines through and she articulates things with amazing clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the show, the host asks her a simple question: “What should someone who &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt;
to become a deep reader do to regain the mythical state of deep reading that Wolf advocates for?”
Here, Wolf falters. First, she shares her habit of spending 20 minutes after waking up and before
going to sleep reading a book, philosophy in the morning and classics at night. The host pushes back
on her suggestion. Then, she suggests that it is up to each individual. Then, she digresses from the
topic of reading to the phenomenally more complex topic of “just being yourself” using other mediums
such as music. This was a disappointing end to a great conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L. M. Sacasas’ newsletter is rich in media theory but light on recommendations, and perhaps it is so
by design. Illing’s conversation about their new book about the connection between media and
democracy was also informative: It touches back to the origins of media theory during the post-war
period, when the TV was initially introduced. Illing is optimistic about the tools we have today but
thinks that we are only at the beginning and that we don’t need to really worry too much about the
bad ways in which these tools are affecting us, because a lot of change is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of recommendations might also be from the structure of these conversations and the medium
through which they reach their audience: The News. The self-inflicted wound of saying consume less
news on a newspaper is not beyond any of these experts; however, I doubt that they would say it. The
closest I can think of is something that Ezra Klein said in his podcast with Johann Hari about
attention, in which he says that we should consume far less news than we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-constants&quot;&gt;The Constants&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the constants. These are the things that are referred to as “required reading” in most of
the conversations, and are rarely debated as being true.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medium is the Message
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;McLuhan wrote a book about this: “Everything on T.V. should be entertaining. Education shows
like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063951/?ref_=ttls_li_tt&quot;&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt; are on T.V. Kids who watch TV end up believing that education should be
entertaining too.” It’s not that they don’t learn something on these “edutainment” shows; they
&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; learn something useful and this complicates things furthers, because they now expect that
education should be presented to them in an entertaining manner. (Remember all the “Let’s make
Mathematics fun” talk? Duolingo tries to make language learning fun by gamifying it.)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attention should be conceptualized as a resource. Attention spans are decreasing.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Attention span is (roughly) the period of time for which someone can pay undivided attention to
a single concept or thought. Attention as a resource is a way of conceptualizing what is being
sold by Facebook to the advertiser, when they provide the Newsfeed for free.  There is no
monetary exchange. The only exchange is temporal and so time itself (or attention, the act of
spending time on something) is the resource.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading is in decline&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The percentage of 12th graders who read a book or a magazine every day declined from 60% in the
late 1970s to 16% by 2016, and 8th graders spent almost an hour less time watching TV in 2016
compared with the early 1990s&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fppm0000203&quot;&gt;Trends in U.S. Adolescents’ media use, 1976-2016: The rise of digital media, the decline of TV, and the (near) demise of print. - PsycNET&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mass media is designed around consumer buying. Sensational coverage gets people more engaged
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This has been a known trope about television coverage of terrorism, protests and accidents, or
other traumatic events for a while now. Every protest produces the same set of photographs: A
group of people, preferably in masks, throwing dangerous objects like rocks and Molotov
cocktails at armed police officers, preferably in riot gear. All of it is because of the
economic absurdity of covering something without sensationalism. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srnA3cNTsXQ&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; illustrates this
point.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Content is designed to be engaging and sensational, not informative or educational
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/03/14/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites-2-objective-analysis&quot;&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; of posts analyzing the home pages of several news websites at the same point
in time. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjCCWdKr8Y&quot;&gt;Nancy Grace section&lt;/a&gt; in the TV show Newsroom is indicative of this tendency.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information is super-abundant on the Internet. Algorithms sort through this information and act
as the middlemen who deal content to users.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Long gone are the concepts of a trusted TV stations or a single newspaper of record. There are
innumerable sources of information on the internet and anything you want to believe can be
proved by picking the sources that support your viewpoint and smearing those that oppose your
beliefs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Algorithms are designed to increase engagement and profits through advertising networks
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Many news websites have advertising through ad networks, or pleas for donations on all of
their articles. Clearly, “journalism” is not paying for itself.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some people &lt;em&gt;hack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the media by being egregiously engaging and sensational
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Trump, Musk, Kangana Ranaut&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Twitter is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the platform for informed discourse
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Saunders, who wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/08/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-george-saunders.html?&quot;&gt;Braindead Megaphone&lt;/a&gt;, says that Twitter is a strange place because it
places a limit on what can be said and how many characters can be used. Why is this limit
being placed? See “(1): Medium is the Message.” What can be said in 280 characters is probably
neither useful nor insightful; it is merely provocative. (Typical example of click bait that
is now accepted: “Why did Elon Musk buy Twitter? A thread. 1/n”)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Twitter &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; the platform for informed discourse
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ezra Klein has said on his podcast repeatedly that Twitter is an important place for
journalists because that is where they get their story ideas and that is where they realize
what the “vibe” of a particular subject really is. Clearly, most journalists think that
Twitter is a good platform, despite vehemently denying its validity and arguing about the
ease of being manipulated into believing something is more important than it actually is.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Movement and vivid colors capture people’s attention
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is a dig at some of the more obvious takes around parenting. Children don’t come into
possession of video games / gaming consoles / digital screens in a vacuum. Parents buy these
things for their children to achieve some goal. This goal might very well be to fan the
parents’ addiction to media and screens, an addiction that is not good for either parent or
child. Wolf’s expertise with children, literacy, and the effects digital skimming culture
have on parents and children is another very good part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/22/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-maryanne-wolf.html&quot;&gt;the conversation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-actions&quot;&gt;The Actions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the actions that I took over the past few months.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;less-skimming-less-news&quot;&gt;Less Skimming. Less News.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stop reading the news. You don’t need to know &lt;strong&gt;everything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. I am going to rip the band-aid off real quick: &lt;strong&gt;90% of News is either sensationalist or
useless.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be a big-time news reader. I read a morning briefing from the New York Times.  I listened
to about 40 minutes of news podcast on an average day.  I spent a big portion of free time during
the day reading articles that appeared in the notifications on my phone. The constant flow of news
powers the adrenaline rush of being part of a (hyper) connected world. However, it has no practical
use. I don’t work in the news or any news-adjacent business, and I have no obligation to be informed
of “current affairs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I listen to 20 minutes of news, from a briefing podcast, every morning. This has been my only
source for the past 6 months and I am doing just fine. I will not be returning to reading more news
anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A caveat:&lt;/strong&gt; I am yet to completely think through the impact this has on my beliefs about democracy
itself: I have said before on this blog that an informed electorate is a prerequisite for a
democracy that works. I look forward to reading Illing et al’s work about democracy and media
consumption and trying to have clearer thoughts on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-magazines&quot;&gt;More Magazines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Buy the print version of a non-news, non-“current affairs” magazine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be completely disconnected from magazines. I did not appreciate the form until last year,
when I subscribed to &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/12/the-new-yorker-subscription&quot;&gt;the New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; on a whim. While that particular magazine published at a rate
that was much too fast for me (4 issues / month), I subscribed to the print version of WIRED, a
tech- and media-adjacent magazine this year (1 issue / month). I really like the format: The shorter
columns are great for free time during the day, the longer reads are thought-provoking profiles or
excerpts from books.  There is almost no politics in the whole magazine. Topics are not limited to
current affairs. (My favorite long pieces from the last few issues was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/multifarious-multiplexity-taika-waititi/&quot;&gt;an eccentric profile&lt;/a&gt; of the
filmmaker Taika Waititi and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/david-wengrow-dawn-of-everything/&quot;&gt;a fascinating interview&lt;/a&gt; with one of the authors of the book The Dawn of
Everything&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note:&lt;/strong&gt; Magazine aggregators like the Apple News service might look inexpensive.  I suspect that
having access to &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; much information can tempt readers to switch back to the digital skimming
modes of reading. So, for now, I am staying away from aggregators and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-fiction&quot;&gt;More Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Good fiction is a great story with interesting people in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think fiction is where the most amazing type of reading happens. Regrettably, a lot of non-fiction
is little more than information gathering or propaganda for some hustle culture concept like Todo
lists or habit forming or how CEOs spend their day.  Only the absolute best non-fiction books&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
rise above the “merely communicating information” level to the “mindset forming” level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of non-fiction, especially the “top of the best seller lists” non-fiction books, are
little more than a single, interesting insight repeated over the entirety of a 200-page light read:
These are the &lt;em&gt;airport best sellers&lt;/em&gt; that you should stay away from. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/IfBooksPod&quot;&gt;This podcast&lt;/a&gt; pokes fun at these
books and is entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-blocks-of-time&quot;&gt;More Blocks of Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reading for 2 hours at a time is better than for several periods of a few minutes each&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my most useful insight of the past year. Deep reading (or the focus required for that)
doesn’t just happen. It is also very hard to maintain that focus consciously. So, the best method to
naturally prepare yourself for a period of deep focus is to set aside a large block of time and do
nothing except read in that block. This is hard, and perhaps many weeks will go by until I
get a satisfying block to do this. Nevertheless, I have resorted to this approach now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For something as open-ended as reading, the levels of motivation vary over time and the books that
you pick up; chances are high that you can turn your “desire” to read into a “habit” of reading
through any sort of strict framework. Coming up with the framework and enforcing it on yourself
though? Well, &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; is on you, the reader. The hardest part of doing more “deep reading” is that
there is no trick. But that should not prevent media theorists from putting forth better
recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;For some of the constants I have added some notes in the list about where the concept comes from and how I understood it. These notes are completely optional and you can skip them if the constant is self-evident or obvious to you. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My reading about media and media theory is only beginning. I hope to revisit Postman’s book about television, the recent book by Illing and co. about the connection between government and media, and a few research papers that Wolf mentions in her conversation. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is a syntactical fight about what “useful” really is and who gets to decide it. In this case, I get to decide it because I found that most of what I was reading in the news was not useful except as trivia. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The interview might be fascinating for this single line: “Wengrow had no contact with Musk, about whom he appeared to know little, and care less.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Notes and Review - The Castle (Kafka)</title>
   <link href="/2022/12/02/review-the-castle-kafka"/>
   <updated>2022-12-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/12/02/review-the-castle-kafka</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This novel is humorous. The characters and their interactions, the presumptions that they make about
each other based on trivial details, the protagonist’s (His name is K.) strange obsession over every
single alphabet in the letters that he receives, characters that have a job which they do only when
they want to. Everything in the novel is humorous. On the surface. Just underneath the surface,
lurks the boundless struggle and omnipresent hopelessness of a life in the world that
K. inhabits. (The world that he is in is &lt;strong&gt;eerily, and perhaps intentionally&lt;/strong&gt; similar to our own.)
This is not a dystopia; the bureaucratic hell that K. is subjected to is one that many are familiar
with. The nightmare does not stop when you have procured every new document that the government has
ever issued to its citizens; it continues, for the government takes great relish in moving the
goalposts and confusing people; keeping them inside their Web browser until their citizens are
exasperated enough to just close the tab and move on. The only difference between the citizens of
our world and K. is that K. &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;kafkaesque-imagery&quot;&gt;Kafkaesque Imagery&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, Kafka’s imagery remains unchanged. The first room that the protagonist enters is dark and
suffocating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was a large, dimly lit room. Coming in from outside, he could see nothing at first. K. staggered and nearly fell
over a washing-trough; a woman’s hand caught him. He heard a number of children shouting in one corner.
Steam billowed out of another, turning the twilight into darkness. K. might have been surrounded by clouds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;officials-in-bed-during-hearings&quot;&gt;Officials in Bed During Hearings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of Kafka’s classic images. I believe that his intention with showing officials in bed is
to show their lethargy during work and their lack of motivation to really help the
petitioner. During the last section of the novel, K. meets an official who hints that he might be
partly responsible for K.’s case and that he can grant any of K.’s wishes on the spot. He says that
the officials are overwhelmed with work and so sensitive that they can barely sleep at night and
thus, they conduct all their hearings in the Castle Inn. But the Castle’s staff thinks that the
Officials sleep &lt;strong&gt;too much,&lt;/strong&gt; and in fact, it is because they have so much work during the day/night
that they are always tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this contradiction and absurdity, the midnight hearings, officials in bed, people being asked
to wait in the cold to meet officials, official summons that arrive through messengers, assistants
who are not assisting, serves to make K.’s situation look more and more hopeless and
pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the reader, I wanted K. to just &lt;em&gt;give up,&lt;/em&gt; on many occasions. But therein lies the rub: When I
was stuck in a bureaucratic hell, I did not give up. I would not have even imagined it. To fight
your way out of the mess that you are in is the only available option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;officials-dont-make-mistakes&quot;&gt;Officials Don’t Make Mistakes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important moment in the novel is when K. finds out that he is in the village by mistake. Kafka’s
writing is deliciously absurd. I was giggling throughout this long section in which an official
explains how officials never make mistakes, and thus when a document appears in front of them, it
doesn’t occur to them that it was due to a mistake, and thus, due to their assumption that they
don’t make mistakes they end up making mistakes and what should have been ended in a minute of
honest doubt and humiliation drags on for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[The official who is speaking explains that the proposal for appointing a land surveyor was sent to
his department by department A. Then, the monologue continues.]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For a start, however, I can tell you the story without files. We replied to the decree I was talking
about by sending our thanks, but pointing out that we didn’t need a land surveyor. However, that
reply doesn’t seem to have reached the original department, let’s call it A, but by mistake went to
another department, B&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;as often and understandably happens, and indeed should happen, in view of the meticulous nature of
all the official work done, the head of department was relying on us to send an answer, whereupon he
would either appoint the land surveyor or, if necessary, correspond with us on the subject
further. As a result, he neglected to look at the preliminary notes and let the whole affair lapse
into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is a working principle of the authorities that they do not even consider the possibility of
mistakes being made.  The excellent organization of the whole thing justifies that principle, which
is necessary if tasks are to be performed with the utmost celerity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked a simple follow up question by the protagonist about whether the supervisory authorities
who are supposed to catch such mistakes did not succeed in their duty this time, the official comes
up with this gold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Only a complete stranger would ask your question. Are there supervisory authorities? There are only supervising
authorities. To be sure, they’re not intended to detect mistakes in the vulgar sense of the word, since there are no
mistakes, and even if there is a mistake, as in your own case, who’s to say that it’s really a mistake in the long
run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official also describes something that has happened to me once when dealing with the government:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And now I come to a particular feature of our official mechanism. When an affair has been under
consideration for a very long time, and even before assessment of it is complete, it can happen that
something occurs to settle it, like a sudden flash of lightning at some unforeseeable point, and you
can’t pinpoint it later. The case is thus brought to an arbitrary, if usually quite correct,
conclusion. It’s as if the official mechanism could no longer stand up to the tension and the years
of attrition caused by the same factor, which in itself may be slight, and has made the decision of
its own accord with no need for the officials to take a hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K.’s summary of all this? Pretty good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K.:&lt;/strong&gt; So the outcome is that everything is very confused and nothing can be solved, and I’m being
thrown out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mayor:&lt;/strong&gt; Who would venture to throw you out, my dear sir? The very lack of clarity in the earlier
questions assures you of the most civil treatment, but you appear to be oversensitive. No one is
keeping you here, but that doesn’t amount to being thrown out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you are not being thrown out. But everything &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; very confused and nothing can &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; be solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hierarchy-is-everything-to-the-officials&quot;&gt;Hierarchy is Everything to the Officials&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klamm is a God-like figure to the people in this village. K. is engaged in a tussle to meet with
this man. When he tries to do so, he is thwarted. Soon after, Klamm escapes quickly and K. and an
official observe him through a keyhole. (Yes, 2 grown men peeping through a keyhole at Klamm.) After
this plays out, the official gives a summary that is indicative of the absolute reverence that one
must show when they are in a hierarchy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;K. asked: ‘Has Klamm left, then?’ He said it not to have what he already knew confirmed but to anticipate an
attack, for he rather feared he was vulnerable now. The landlady walked past him in silence, but the gentleman
said, from his little table: ‘Yes, to be sure. Once you had left the place where you were standing guard, Klamm
was able to go out. But it’s amazing what a sensitive gentleman he is. Did you notice, ma’am,’ he asked the land-
lady, ‘how nervously Klamm looked around?’ The landlady did not seem to have noticed, but the gentleman
went on: ‘Well, luckily there was nothing left to be seen. The driver had covered up the tracks in the snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first point at which K. shows some defiance.  This gentleman is a secretary of some sort
to Klamm. He is working on his report for Klamm, and he wants K. to answer some questions so that he
might be able to complete the report. But K. refuses to be questioned. There is no way to know
whether this is a turning point in K.’s story. Kafka’s implication is probably that answering his
questions/refusing to be questioned will have little impact on the final resolution of K.’s
case. (And when will that come? There is no final resolution to expect.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;defiance-and-dejection&quot;&gt;Defiance and Dejection&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the topic of defiance, the second protagonist of the story is Amalia, one of the messenger’s
sisters. The messenger and their family is reviled in the village. People scoff at them, and they
treat them quite poorly. K. and the reader find out, when Amalia explains, that this is because
Sortini (an official) called Amalia to him and Amalia refused to go. Klamm and Sortini (and other
men associated with the Castle) are philanderers who call women to them at periodic intervals. The
landlady and even K.’s partner, Frieda, were women who had been called by Klamm. Amalia’s defiance
to submit to Sortini’s (by extension, The Castle’s) wishes made her and her family a pariah in the
village. It crushes her parents, and they &lt;strong&gt;instantly&lt;/strong&gt; become too old and frail and need Amalia’s
constant care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The curious thing is that the Castle never gets officially involved with punishing Amalia. Indeed,
no punishment is warranted because she did not do anything that was against the law anyway. She
simply refused to answer a summons from a private individual, who happened to be associated with The
Castle. However, there is a general sense that Amalia has done something wrong. The story keeps
changing and becomes more and more extreme with every retelling (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers&quot;&gt;Chinese whispers&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the stories have done the round, the Village is ready to forget and simply expects them to
return to their earlier way of life. However, they don’t know how to do so. So, the Villagers
continue to believe that there is some sort of punishment and avoid them forever. When the family
petitions the Castle to help them, the officials in the Castle (understandably) ask them what they
must help with? What have they done? What should they be forgiven for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is futile to ask for forgiveness for something when you have no idea what happened or what your
mistake was. The story of the Barnabas family is one of defiance and dejection. They had done
nothing wrong. But The Castle controlled everything. Even the appearance of defiance against such an
absolute authority has a high cost. Despite their story, I don’t think that Kafka urges the reader
to comply. I think Kafka urges us all to be defiant of the bureaucratic hurdles that we face. But I
think he asks us to remember that “The Village” &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; forget at some point and we must also
&lt;strong&gt;forget&lt;/strong&gt; then. We should not let our defiance weigh too heavily on us; so heavily that it prevents
us from returning to normalcy when everyone else expects things to “go back to the way they were.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This special case of apparent external normalcy coexisting with internal turmoil is a favorite of
Kafka’s, and he returns to it in both his other novels (The Trial and Amerika.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;little-tyrannies&quot;&gt;Little Tyrannies&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kafka is undoubtedly obsessed with authority. Especially the kind of authority that is conferred
upon people who are “big fishes in small ponds.” Throughout the novel, the landlady has her own
little tyranny inside her inn, Frieda has a small one when she is barmaid, the secretary has one
when Klamm is not around, Klamm has one that is all-encompassing and covers the whole village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence of these tyrannies and the attempts of the tyrants to exhibit their power inside their
little tyranny is the root cause of the troubles that K. is facing. Indeed, it is the root cause of
the troubles that many of us face when we deal with intractable bureaucracies. How can one deal with
these tyrannies? Kafka gives us a clue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s the way it’s organized; all the gentlemen from the castle have their village secretaries.’
Momus, who in fact had been listening much more attentively than K., added, to the landlady: ‘Most
of the village secretaries work only for one master, but I work for two, Klamm and Vallabene.’
‘Yes,’ said the landlady now, also remembering, and turned to K. ‘Mr Momus works for two masters,
for Klamm and for Vallabene, so he is village secretary twice over.’ &lt;strong&gt;‘Twice over–fancy that,’ said
K., nodding as you might nod to a child whom you have just heard praised&lt;/strong&gt; and addressing Momus, who
now, leaning forward, looked up at him. If there was a certain disdain in that nod, it either went
unnoticed or actually seemed requisite. The merits of a man from Klamm’s close circle were being
presented at length to K. of all people, deemed unworthy even to have Klamm set eyes on him by
chance, and it was done with the unconcealed intention of demanding K.’s recognition and praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kafka indicates that we should ignore the empty boasting of tyrants and be defiant in our
demands. Things often resolve themselves, as the mayor explained earlier, and the resolution will
have absolutely no connection to your efforts to solve the problem or the tyrant’s efforts to block
a resolution anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;chaos-confusion-mania&quot;&gt;Chaos, Confusion, Mania&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 particular scenes which are remarkable for the amount of chaos and confusion that is
conveyed in them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;K. and crew wake up in the morning in the school building: After having been appointed the school
janitor, K. proceeds to sleep in the school building. When he wakes up in the morning, he sees
himself surrounded by children waiting to enter the school building and jeering at them. Then,
confusion ensues as they rush around to clean the school building and try to get the place in
order. There is a huge cat that is bothering them. His assistants are creating their own chaos in
parallel. Reading this scene really feels like the author is trying very hard to put us in a
trance and convince us of the hopelessness of K.’s situation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;K. meets with Erlanger and the files are subsequently distributed to all the officials who are in
the basement rooms at the Castle Inn. Once again, the situation is one of utter chaos and
mania. Files are being passed around and kept at the doors of officials. When the files are kept,
officials greedily grab them. They ring the bells to call &lt;em&gt;someone.&lt;/em&gt; This exercise ends after a
long description of the craziness that has ensued during a procedure that one would assume was
mundane, especially since it was being done every morning. Nothing is mundane in Kafka’s world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Why Do You Read Entertainment Supplements?</title>
   <link href="/2022/10/13/entertainment-supplements"/>
   <updated>2022-10-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/10/13/entertainment-supplements</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The newspaper represents the canonical form of media. This medium is devoid of the strangeness
inherent in 24-hour TV&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and has been around long enough for its form to reach a state of
equilibrium; a state that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be understood. Of all the pages in a newspaper, I want to talk about
the entertainment pages. &lt;strong&gt;What is the point of the entertainment supplement that accompanies
newspapers?&lt;/strong&gt; These supplements often start with a headline in which an actor is promoting a
movie. The key however is that the actor says something unrelated; or “reveals” a secret about their
work or life so that the reader is first trapped into reading the article. &lt;em&gt;Eventually,&lt;/em&gt; the reader
will find out that they are promoting a movie. I did not know this for a while; when watching
television shows where guests would come on the show as “judges,” I was not able to recognize
immediately that the people who came on the show were there only when they were promoting
something. Once I realized that actors go on TV shows for only that reason, the connections were
much easier to draw. Whenever a new movie comes out, the people associated with the movie try to get
as much footage as they possibly can. This is simply the way marketing works; a banal truth. Is this
media blitz anything &lt;strong&gt;except&lt;/strong&gt; marketing? Why do the media organizations become tools in this
marketing? Why do people fall for this &lt;em&gt;not immediately obvious&lt;/em&gt; marketing ploy, despite years of
formulaic use? Those are the questions I am going to attempt to answer in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;page-3-is-a-waste-of-time&quot;&gt;Page 3 is A Waste of Time&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the apparently easy question. Newspapers contain “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_3_(film)&quot;&gt;Page 3&lt;/a&gt;”, the page that has a
bunch of photographs of the parties that happened last night. Page 3 is useless for everyone who
is not someone who wants to go to these parties or is trying to make a career as an actor. The
information contained in these pages is mostly about who is hosting parties, why, and whom they
invited. By looking at these lists, perhaps an aspiring actor can identify the people that they need
to get in with to be cast in the next big-budget movie that comes along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;entertainment-pages-contain-only-trivia&quot;&gt;Entertainment Pages Contain Only Trivia&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about pages 1 and 2 of the entertainment supplement? Is there any information in these pages at
all? In the most basic sense of the word, there absolutely is: Actors talk about the pranks that
they played on other actors when they were on set; a newbie talks about their experience working
with an experienced actor; an experienced actor talks about working with a reputed director; and so
on. But this information is seldom being communicated for its own sake. &lt;strong&gt;It is being communicated as
a ploy to sell the image of the speaker to the next person who is going to employ them.&lt;/strong&gt; For
example, the actor that talks about a director allowing them creative freedom with dialogues is
expressing that the actor expects this freedom to act well.  This piece of information matters only
to someone who &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be in a position to choose the actor for some role. For everyone else, it is
&lt;strong&gt;just trivia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A non-trivia usage of this information also exists. This information, in some cases, might allow
the viewer to assign value to the actor’s or the director’s skill and decide whether they trust them
to deliver a good product in the future. However, I don’t believe that the information communicated
in entertainment supplements can sway people much. By definition, this is information that is
designed to paint the actor in a good light for a future producer or director. The information is
never delivered along with the measured criticism that one would find in any good review; it comes
only with a modest amount of self-criticism.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this logic, for someone who is not in the “film industry,” the entertainment supplement is simply
a collection of trivia about people whose films (or other artworks) were released recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;is-there-such-a-thing-as-useful-trivia&quot;&gt;Is There Such a Thing as Useful Trivia?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of trivia out there. The media industry is built around telling you about it. I think
that trivia is mildly interesting in the party setting. It can keep the conversation going when you
can talk about how some actor is famously down-to-earth. (Why shouldn’t they be down-to-earth?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, trivia isn’t really “useful” information for its own sake. “General knowledge”, that set of
facts which includes such diverse things as the name of the second person to walk on the Moon and
the national flower of Vietnam, isn’t useful for its own sake either.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Trivia is useless unless
it is being used to do &lt;em&gt;something,&lt;/em&gt; such as deciding whether or not you want to cast an actor who
always has a prank up their sleeve in a historical drama. (You probably don’t, but what do I care? I
will never be in that position anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the actor/director talks about their craft and their practice of it, things get interesting and
veer out of the “trivia” zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, here is a fact about Anthony Hopkins&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: “Hopkins reads the script 200 times or so,
ensuring that the dialogue is lodged in his brain.” If you have watched the TV series West World and
you noticed something different about his acting compared to the other actors, perhaps &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; could
be one reason why he is able to deliver in a way that other actors can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is trivia about a director’s choice&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: Eric Heisserer, screenwriter who adapted
the short story “Story of Your Life” by Ted Chiang to the script for the movie Arrival (2016), told
Chiang that he wanted to change the context of his story before adapting it, because he felt that
Chiang’s framing of the main character’s dilemma (in the short story) was not convincing enough to
engage a visual audience. This has huge ramifications on the final piece of art. I believe that this
single change completely changed the movie adaptation from the short story: The message communicated
in the movie is the exact opposite of what Chiang communicated in the short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume that artists would love to keep talking about their craft. This might still not be
interesting enough for the media industry to sell newspapers. How many newspapers can be sold on the
above non-trivia facts? Compare your estimate to the number of newspapers &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think can be sold
when one actor claims that another actor plays a prank on all his colleagues which involves a bucket
of water (or some other “prank-y” object.) My estimate is that the latter fact can sell manifold
more papers. &lt;strong&gt;The entertainment supplement headlines write themselves when they are about the
“atmosphere on set.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the reason useless trivia often finds itself on the front page of entertainment supplements
(and gossip sites or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndtv.com/&quot;&gt;serious news sites&lt;/a&gt; on the Internet.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;buffoonery-disguised-as-news&quot;&gt;Buffoonery Disguised as “News”&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once people realize that they are being suckered into buying things by these salesmen disguised as
artists and that they are being fed an endless series of unimportant and useless drivel, wouldn’t
they simply stop buying newspapers? No. All of this buffoonery is disguised as “news,” and to not
follow the news is sacrilege. After all, you want to be an &lt;strong&gt;informed citizen,&lt;/strong&gt; don’t you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ridicule that someone is subjected to for not knowing the president of a country is not for the
fainthearted. The news has replaced every other way to pass our time as the only thing that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/may/03/how-the-news-took-over-reality&quot;&gt;worth&lt;/a&gt;
our attention. Push notifications about the latest protests in Iran or the newly elected leader of a
faraway country keep everyone hooked to their screens. I have felt this when I see real time stories
unfold. It is hard to get yourself out of the situation where you feel like you have to know what is
going to go down; even though you might not lose much by simply following up on a news digest in a
few hours / days / weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the morning of February 24, 2022, I found myself in front of live news coverage from Al Jazeera
on YouTube. The Russian invasion was about to begin in a few hours; however, the correspondent was
walking around a Ukrainian town and talking about how people were surprisingly normal; how the
atmosphere really felt like the “calm before the storm.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A knee jerk reaction is that this is
preposterous; the citizens must not have been &lt;em&gt;informed&lt;/em&gt;; they must have been watching state
propaganda; some form of “&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; would not be this calm if I was in Ukraine”; etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I avoid that knee jerk reaction, then I see that this is the most likely situation in most
places. If a war is about to start but no one knows that it certainly will, why would they change
their behavior? It is the observer who is projecting their expectation onto these people. It is
these people that we see on the screen who are &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; living the experience the observer is
watching from far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s another question: Can this coverage be educational? Does this teach other people how to
behave when their city might be invaded? No, I don’t think so. 7 months into the war, coverage of
that first day of the war seems misguided and naive. Nothing useful could have been learned on that
first day. Everything that was important was either far back in history (e.g. Russia started
sanctions-proofing its economy in 2014; Germany was highly dependent on Russian natural gas) or
about to come (e.g. Russia would turn off energy supplies to Germany; Ukraine would not share
intelligence with its Western backers). All of these things are contained in history books and
&lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; kinds of outlets which focus on creating evergreen content, such as Vox or Vice. They
provide a larger perspective; the perspective that one would find educational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;havent-things-always-been-like-this&quot;&gt;Haven’t Things Always Been Like This?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, they haven’t. A century ago, things were not like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I make this assertion with full knowledge of the human folly of thinking that the situation that we
find ourselves in is completely novel and has never been dealt with before. I am probably making the
same mistake here. People who were alive when printed books were getting exponentially cheaper or
when literacy was increasing rapidly probably also felt that things were getting much worse than
ever before in history. Indeed, one of the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Protestantism#Overview&quot;&gt;effects&lt;/a&gt; of the printing press was in the spread of
Protestanism which sparked many wars.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downton Abbey, a show based in the early 20th century, shows a doctor who is not confident about the
latest treatment for one of his patients’ illness. &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is unthinkable in today’s world of
medicine, where doctors are expected to know &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; in their field of expertise. Until the
advent of cheap telegrams and local newspapers, which started printing national and international
news, it was still possible to know only the news of the locality that one lived in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes can happen fast because they are simple first-order effects of technological progress.
And as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-sean-illing.html&quot;&gt;Illing notes&lt;/a&gt;, technological advancements like the telegram, television, and the Internet
changed our society fundamentally without a vote or the majority’s consent. Our belief that
technological progress is inevitable is enough to cement these advancements into our way of life. An
individual can merely &lt;em&gt;adapt&lt;/em&gt; to this new way of life. (&lt;strong&gt;Case-in-point:&lt;/strong&gt; All the recent talk about
the metaverse obscures one question: &lt;strong&gt;Who wants the metaverse?&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/media-buffoonery.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People buy newspapers because they feel &lt;strong&gt;it is their job&lt;/strong&gt; to be informed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Society hammers into children the importance of “general knowledge.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Newspapers need content which is interesting at a superficial level and entertaining in a boring,
obvious manner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People in the entertainment industry provide this content in the form of trivia which they hope
will impress their next employer and get them their next assignment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Media organizations peddle this trivia around society&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Society makes those who don’t know the trivia look uninformed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consequently: &lt;strong&gt;People read entertainment supplements,&lt;/strong&gt; despite getting the worst part of the
bargain, and &lt;strong&gt;losing time&lt;/strong&gt; in the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>10 Common Features of Communist Regimes</title>
   <link href="/2022/08/27/features-of-communism"/>
   <updated>2022-08-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/08/27/features-of-communism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The primary source for this list is Dalrymple’s account of his visits to 5 Communist countries as
described in his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18683439-the-wilder-shores-of-marx?from_search=true&amp;amp;from_srp=true&amp;amp;qid=xMyKQN1V4c&amp;amp;rank=1&quot;&gt;The Wilder Shores of Marx (Dalrymple)&lt;/a&gt;. Dalrymple visited these countries in
the late 1980s, and several of these countries have since turned to democracy. The 2 other major
sources that have influenced me would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/BFwGqLa_oAo&quot;&gt;movies&lt;/a&gt; about life in Eastern Europe during or right after
the 2nd World War (such as Pianist (2002)) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961427-1984?from_search=true&amp;amp;from_srp=true&amp;amp;qid=4UzFdW1uGJ&amp;amp;rank=1&quot;&gt;Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984&lt;/a&gt;. More recent sources
include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-mUZRP-fpo&quot;&gt;the Vox episode about Cuba released in 2015&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbuZlTBpC7I&quot;&gt;contemporary travel vlogs from North Korea.&lt;/a&gt;
For lists such as this one, it is hard to pin point where exactly the idea originated from. I would
say that the list is an amalgamation of the information provided by the sources I have mentioned and
the impression they had on me about the life of ordinary people in the remaining Communist countries
of the world. Other media has also influenced me, notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/-RobJFXP3ZM?list=PLTHOlLMWEwVy52FUngq91krMkQDQBagYw&amp;amp;t=293&quot;&gt;Casey Neistat’s reflections about his trip
to Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVL8S3lUHf0QDcdBy2Vjx706EemjnE5Yg&quot;&gt;Conan’s hilarious series of shows from Cuba&lt;/a&gt; and the Korean drama &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/Title/81159258&quot;&gt;Crash Landing on You&lt;/a&gt;, in
which the protagonist is a North Korean army officer. (An upcoming review of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11835721-the-party&quot;&gt;McGregor’s The Party&lt;/a&gt;,
an account of the governing system in China, will clarify &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; China did not conform to the typical
Communist regime expectations either when Dalrymple visited the other states or today; its curious
mix of capitalist economics with Communist ideology has borne the greatest success story in the past
half century.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I structured this as a list after reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://dynomight.net/lists/&quot;&gt;Dynomight’s post supporting lists&lt;/a&gt; as a tool for effective
communication.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationing of Food Items:&lt;/strong&gt; All communist countries are forced to ration food items. Why is this?
Dalrymple’s dry humor gives us the answer when he is in Vietnam. “After 50 years, he [the leader]
realized that the peasant &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be paid a fair market price for his harvest. Realizing something
that obvious late in life &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; original.” The “means of production” is owned by the government in
communist states. This means that every farm becomes a part of the large government
farm. Everything that is grown in these farms is the government’s property by default.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The
harvest is then split among the people in the country. The key question in this setup of communes
is &lt;strong&gt;what motivates the farmer to produce a good harvest when they are going to get the same
amount no matter what they produce above the official quota?&lt;/strong&gt; The answer, generally, is
nothing. And thus, there is a severe shortage of food produced in the country and an even more
severe shortage of food that must be imported from other countries. (Communist countries are
almost uniformly shunned by trade partners.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Waiter Rules:&lt;/strong&gt; In a country where food is scarce, the waiter holds as much sway as the bank
manager, with the power to sanction a loan, does in capitalist society. Repeatedly, the author
runs into disinterested waiters drunk on their power to apportion food among the poor customers
at &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; establishment. (Remember that there is no private property in communism.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Currency is of No Value:&lt;/strong&gt; As the country produces little, it exports even less. This in turn
causes the currency to have no real value at all. When foreigners come into these countries, they
are forced to buy the local currency, so that the government can get its hand on foreign
currency, which it will use to import the minimum amount of food that is required for the members
of the Communist Party. Foreign currency (such as US dollars), cigarettes and cans of gasoline
are the usual substitutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Megalomaniacs in Power:&lt;/strong&gt; Dalrymple excels at pointing out why megalomaniacs tend to be in
power in a communist country, unless interventions are made specifically to keep them out. The
forefathers of communist thought, Marx and Engels, repeatedly said that the human mind is weak
and will be attracted towards consumerism and materialism, that communism was the system through
which the human mind could be remade into one that appreciated the beauty of enforced equality as
against the ugliness of unthinkable inequality, which they predicted (rightly) would be the
outcome that capitalism would produce. The leaders of communist rebellions and countries strongly
believe that every human who has lived before them has had this weakness and that they are the
&lt;em&gt;first ones&lt;/em&gt; who were able to overcome it and become better men (after the masters, of course:
Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and to a lesser extent, Mao.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) In order to believe this
“primacy of thought” among &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; humans who have ever lived and to carry out actions that are
required to bring this dream of a “new man” to reality, one &lt;strong&gt;has&lt;/strong&gt; to be a &lt;strong&gt;megalomaniac,&lt;/strong&gt; with a
huge ego and an even larger portrait of himself at every street corner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grotesquely Large Roads with No Sign of Life:&lt;/strong&gt; There must be no private property in communist
states. What, then, is the purpose of an 8-lane road? Wouldn’t these roads be used by private
cars? Surely, public transport would not require roads this big unless there were to be 8
parallel buses plying between 2 places? Here, Dalrymple begins pointing out the hypocrisy
inherent in the minds of the communist leaders of the late 20th century: Their pathway towards
development is different; but their idea of the finished product is the same: The acquisition of
material goods. By constructing roads and bragging to foreigners that they have such
infrastructure or that their roads are never crowded betrays their willingness to give up on
their ideology if it is for the (funnily noble) cause of convincing &lt;a href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/08/22/useful-idiot/&quot;&gt;“useful idiots”&lt;/a&gt; in foreign
countries about their country’s rejection of “backwardness” and its adoption of “modernity.”
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dalrymple points out that there is a ban on owning bicycles in North Korea. This ban &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_North_Korea#cite_note-guardian-3&quot;&gt;was
lifted in 1992&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that there are even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/north-korea-bike-lane-pyongyang?CMP=share_btn_tw&quot;&gt;bike lanes&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intractable Bureaucracies:&lt;/strong&gt; The Communist state will require you to fill in 50 pages of
application forms before you can get your monthly ration. What purpose does this serve? The
answer is twofold. First, it keeps you &lt;strong&gt;occupied.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are busy running around getting
signatures, filling forms, and understanding procedures, you might not notice that they are
meaningless and the forms are most likely incinerated moments after you turn them in. Dalrymple
argues that this is essential to a paranoid state because it will restrict the time that ordinary
people have to plot a rebellion. Second, it demonstrates the control that the Communist Party has
on every day life. Intractable bureaucracies &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/18/the-trial-review&quot;&gt;exist in democracies&lt;/a&gt; as well, but there, they serve
a genuine purpose (the government’s purpose to help its citizens). They become intractable
because they are inefficiently run.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Irrational Fear of Rebellion:&lt;/strong&gt; Communist states almost always come up as rebellions. The
rebels overthrow a sitting government and establish their new state. This makes them paranoid
about the next rebellion; a government that came to power through a rebellion could just as
easily be overthrown by another rebellion. The lengths that the different states go to in order
to prevent even the rumblings of a rebellion is the scariest feature of implemented Communist
thought. In the police states of Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the secret police is everywhere
and everyone is an informer to the secret police. There are so many informers that the secret
police would see agents reporting on the suspicious activities of other agents, who they think
are civilians. In the Communist states in Asia and South America, the secret police is
undoubtedly there but takes over less of the daily life of ordinary people. It seemed to me that
the Vietnamese people that Dalrymple meets on his travels were far more open about their dislike
of the government than those in Europe. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFPjJM6yYS8&quot;&gt;Vox’ video about Cuba’s homegrown network&lt;/a&gt;, locals are
open about their dislike for the government’s curtailing of the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Production is The End-Goal:&lt;/strong&gt; If consumption is evil and strengthens the hand of the capitalist,
production &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; not be for the sole aim of consumption. However, production is clearly
important and shows the state’s strength and its ability to function. So, production is defined
as the end-goal. Production statistics for food, coal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_literature&quot;&gt;poetry collections, and novels&lt;/a&gt; are
ceaselessly announced on state television. These statistics are the tool that the government uses
against foreigners who might claim to locals that their country is backward. The few occasions
that foreigners get to interact with the locals are closely monitored. The “production
supremacy”-related propaganda will serve as a safety net &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; some information about the relative
abundance that is the norm in foreign countries happens to get through to the locals. Orwell’s
memorable account of the essential nature of war for a Communist nation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961427-1984?from_search=true&amp;amp;from_srp=true&amp;amp;qid=4UzFdW1uGJ&amp;amp;rank=1&quot;&gt;his dystopian novel
&lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also comes to mind in this context.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propaganda:&lt;/strong&gt; This is not surprising. Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YU9djt_CQM&quot;&gt;Authoritarian leaders&lt;/a&gt; in democracies are weak for
propaganda campaigns and never miss the chance to lie about something if they can. Dictators in
communist countries are paranoid about a non-state-sponsored narrative about their country’s
failures breaking through and fomenting a rebellion; a rebellion is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; afraid of another
rebellion. Dalrymple, in particular, encounters various kinds of propaganda wherever he
goes. Perhaps the worst was the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche&quot;&gt;Juche idea&lt;/a&gt;,” the state ideology of North Korea. The author
quotes a few paragraphs from the text that was written as the definitive explanation of this
idea. It is clear from these few paragraphs that it is meaningless drivel, with absurd repetition
of words and phrases and no underlying concept worth conveying.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Overarching Narrative:&lt;/strong&gt; There is no space for confusion in a Communist state. “A thing
is either compulsory or prohibited,” Dalrymple says. As he witnesses in Albania, tourists are
shepherded from one museum to the next. Each museum essentially tells the same story: a rebel
who rallies the country and becomes a charismatic leader in his youth, the revolution, the
incredible development that the country sees post-revolution. This narrative does not allow such
banal things as the truth to interfere with the fantasy that it is based on. Never mind that
most people have to stand in line for an hour to get an ice cream. Never mind that they use
cigarettes instead of the local currency. The narrative will always portray the leader as the
only possible savior and as the greatest person to have ever lived. This narrative becomes so
repetitive and formulaic, that Dalrymple starts making a passing reference to it in his later
visits. It makes little difference to him what is being said, and I suspect that the residents
of these countries are the same. Vietnam was perhaps the country where this was least
obvious. After a long guerrilla war, it was clear that there was no single person or entity to
glorify. Also, he makes a good observation: “The falsehoods in propaganda must be proportional
to the failures in the real world.” Vietnam won the war; this was a truth which negated the need
for any other big lie. For countries like Albania, which played a minor part in World War 2 and
the fight against Nazis in Germany, their minor role can only be justified by larger-than-life
claims about their pivotal role in World War 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you like to split hairs, then you might point out that the harvest is not the government’s property. In fact, it is the “property of the public.” “Everyone owns everything and the government manages it for them.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I was surprised by Dalrymple’s account of the leaders in Eastern Europe who openly criticize Mao in their writings. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that in a democracy the citizens never question that the government has absolute control over them; it would be a fool’s errand for the government to go around convincing people of something that they already accept to be fact. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In a brief extract of a book that the main character of 1984 is reading, Orwell writes about why war is essential and to be at war constantly is a core part of the modern state that he depicts in the novel. He says that War is the only “government policy” which can support an unending consumption without creating any progress for normal people. So, to be at war is to keep society stagnant; to leave power structures intact; to conspire to stay in power eternally. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Losing Control of Our Screens and Data</title>
   <link href="/2022/08/23/losing-control-screens-and-data"/>
   <updated>2022-08-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/08/23/losing-control-screens-and-data</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After nearly a decade of using the internet daily, it is clear that users have little control over
what is displayed on their screen.  The control has been ceded to capitalists wishing to sell you
&lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. I am not just talking about the algorithmic social media that is the rage these
days. (&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; Tik Tok is becoming more popular than Instagram because their algorithm is better and
Instagram is getting anxious about it.) I’m talking about &lt;strong&gt;advertisements.&lt;/strong&gt; Newspapers, radio and
television have never given the viewer any option about the advertising content that they
hear/see. On those mediums, it was easier to distinguish between content and advertising. When the
commercial break begins, I can mute the television. With newspapers, I can skim past pages that are
advertisements. When an ad is disguised as a search result marked by a greyed out “Sponsored” label
which is very small and designed to be hard to notice, the user has no choice but to engage with the
ad as if it were a legitimate result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/home/siddharth/personal/blog/public/img/screenshot-2022-08-23-23-44-36.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have gone to &lt;em&gt;frankly&lt;/em&gt; absurd lengths to ensure that advertisements are not seen on my home
network. I have installed an ad blocking DNS server, which requires &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; periodic maintenance. I
have VPN setups to ensure that this DNS server can be used even when I am on mobile data; where
network providers and the phone software forces you to use the provider’s DNS server. I have
installed the uBlock Origin plugin on my computer and I avoid websites which give you some
self-righteous message about how their content is paid for using ads and you should whitelist their
domain: “Our ads are not ads. They are the latest thingamajig and very secure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did we get here? How could a set of technologies aimed to create a network of computers turn
into this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One obvious (and low-hanging fruit-type) answer is capitalism. Capitalism is the overriding
philosophy on today’s internet. Most of the Internet is designed around the facet that it is a
conveyance for the age-old salesperson. There is something to be bought and the viewers are going to
do the buying. Why are they going to buy anything? Because capitalism connects the society’s value
system to things, and the more things you have, the richer you are perceived to be. (Have you not
had the experience of scoffing at someone who said they &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have a Netflix subscription?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inversely, if you don’t have things, then you are one of 2 things: poor or minimalist. Poverty has
always been the same. Today’s minimalism is the life of the average person from a few years ago; a
person who used anything they bought for more than 2 years; someone who liked to buy &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt;
instead of &lt;em&gt;subscriptions&lt;/em&gt; to things; someone who had all their photographs in a photo album or a 1
TB hard drive, instead of the latest cloud storage offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-best-phone-only-for-2-years-though&quot;&gt;The Best Phone (Only For 2 Years Though)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple (famously) spends a huge amount of time and effort on each of their phones. In the bazillion
biographies of Steve Jobs, one thing that gets focused on over and over is that the company is
detail oriented. Tim Cook, current Apple CEO, is known to negotiate contract prices upto the 6th
decimal point because that is &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; detail oriented they are. What happens to their products that
are built with such care and precision? They are chucked out every 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every 2 years, Apple releases a new iPhone. A lot of people with the old iPhone walk into an Apple
Store and trade their existing iPhone in for the latest one. They get a 50% discount on an insanely
overpriced phone. (They also get the social status of owning the latest iPhone. Apple makes a point
to make the backs of phones, the part that is most easily visible to everyone except the owner
iconic and different on every phone. Other phone makers have caught up to them in this
department. The more iconic the back of your phone, the more people will buy it for the social
status of owning it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens to the old iPhone? It is dismantled and used for the parts inside it by Apple. They
will use these parts to make the “best phone,” 2 years from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well. Why would a company that is so focused on details and building good products be so insistent
on getting its users to keep buying the new iPhone? &lt;em&gt;Money.&lt;/em&gt; This is probably banal. Apple wants to
make a lot of money? Duh, of course they do. I think this shows the deep-seated contradiction in the
philosophy of a company that claims to build the “best” products. If the product is that good, why
are you insisting that I change it every 2 years? If the product is that good, why do you stop
sending software updates after 5 years? Apple and its attention to detail is superfluous. Even if
Apple phones were shoddy products starting this September, people will continue to buy them because
it confers social status. The myth of “the Apple product” has been built over 15 years of nearly
constant propaganda; this myth precedes the product in the mind of the consumer. Nation states would
be put to shame by the overarching ads that Apple releases each year. Memorably satirized by The
Onion: “I will basically buy anything if it is shiny and made by Apple.” AirPods Generation 1,
anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am glad to see the latest generation of teens scoff at the origin stories of these large tech
giants. Their reaction seems to be, “Google was started in a garage? Umm, okay. Is that supposed to
be impressive or something?” and I like it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They seem to know something that I did not. I was enamored by Google’s ability to go from a small
company in a garage to where it is today. I was an ardent follower of the “Steve Jobs myth;” the
founding, the firing, the return, the iPod, the laptop comes out of an envelope, the iPod + phone =
iPhone talk: Sign me up for all of it! If this ain’t entertainment, I don’t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continue to admire Zuckerberg’s meteoric rise, his intention to keep control of a company that has
changed culture. (Maybe I should not admire it though, because the change has been &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/04/29/facebook-is-unnecessary&quot;&gt;pretty bad&lt;/a&gt; in
every case.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon of products being marketed as &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;paradigm-changing&lt;/em&gt; when they are
launched and becoming &lt;em&gt;outdated&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt; a year or two later is everywhere. This is true with
the ultra fast-fashion brand Shein. On Shein, consumers buy clothes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/fast-cheap-out-of-control-inside-rise-of-shein/&quot;&gt;as fast as Shein can produce
them&lt;/a&gt; or as fast as they go viral on &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/18/using-tiktok&quot;&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. These two businesses tie into each other. Consumer
choices are now controlled by how fast trends change on an online platform that is known for
dizzyingly fast trend cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;subscriptions-for-everything&quot;&gt;Subscriptions for Everything&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are subscriptions for movies, music, sports, gyms, and cosmetics now. But it doesn’t stop
there. In each of these cases, perhaps you are paying for a service or a good that is not already in
the hardware that is “yours.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New versions of old software are trying to convince you that they are somehow completely different
from whatever came before them. Microsoft Office is a good example of this. For decades now, Office
has remained &lt;em&gt;basically&lt;/em&gt; the same and I am grateful it exists because it has simplified computing
for a lot of people. There have been a bunch of new features which power-users use, but if you are
using Office to write something, print it, and then have people sign on it, the product has remained
unchanged.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Even Office is now different. Instead of selling a software license, Office now
wants you to buy Office 360, the Google Docs clone from Microsoft. Why? Weren’t most users of Office
happy to write things into Word files and then send them around on old-fashioned email? (Email is
one of the last surviving inter-operable communication technologies.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subscription model has caught on like the last raging wildfire somewhere in the world. BMW and
Mercedes are now selling subscriptions for hardware that is &lt;strong&gt;already&lt;/strong&gt; inside their car. Everyone
wants you to buy a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently found out that PocketCasts introduced a feature which enables users to put podcasts into
folders and categorize them. This feature is available only to premium users. And how much does
Premium cost? $1 a month. Does this make any sense? I don’t get it. Why can I not just purchase the
Folders feature for life? What is the service that PocketCasts is selling when I buy the Folders
feature? I like PocketCasts and I recommend it to everyone constantly. But seriously, what is the
feature that I am subscribing to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;goodbye-data&quot;&gt;Goodbye, Data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data subscriptions were an amazing find for Google. Google Drive sells storage in the cloud. You can
upload a lot of data and forget what you uploaded. When you “run out of space,” Google will prompt
you to pay for more (as a subscription, of course) and you will have little choice because the
initial 15 GB of data that Google gives you is so much that you would have used it with abandon and
you no longer know what is in Google Drive, Dropbox, and One Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are unwittingly using Google Photos, then your photos are being backed up all the time. If
you set up a new Android phone recently, the default is to “backup” all your photos to Google Photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of this is designed to make moving out of Google incredibly hard. Here is a
hypothetical scenario:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If Google were to decide that they are going to stop iPhone users from uploading photos to Google
Photos, how many users would switch to Android in the next few days? I would guess that a lot
would. Using iCloud instead is possible, but to get the advantages of facial recognition on
Google Photos, you would have to continue using it and not switch products.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If Google is
allowed to lock out iPhone users, they would almost certainly be able to prevent users from
exporting their data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Governments have “anti-trust” proceedings which can probably stop Google from doing this. But
Google has a distinct advantage. There are about 200 countries in the world, and there would have
to be suits in every single country against Google. In some countries, the legal process might be
quick and Google might be forced to comply within a few weeks. In other countries, legal
proceedings will drag on and on for at least a decade. While people wait for the “landmark
anti-trust ruling,” they will buy Android phones and send even more data Google’s way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think that any of this will happen. We live in the age where a change is defined as good or
bad by the outrage that it generates. So, Google will not want to do this. However, a user of Google
Photos will almost certainly consider good integration with Google Photos a major feature of any
future hardware that they buy. If a Linux / Windows / Apple computer can not integrate as seamlessly
with Google Photos as a Chromebook can, they will go for the Chromebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of scenario is playing out in a few different arenas; not just cloud storage of photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example that is closest to my heart is &lt;strong&gt;Kindle and Amazon.&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon is known for &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611&quot;&gt;large
fundamental changes&lt;/a&gt;. Kindle is a one-stop shop for nearly all books right now. I have a library
inside of Kindle, with books that I have already paid for. If Amazon were to stop sending software
updates to my Kindle and then they claimed to not support my Kindle version for books that were
published after today, then I would be forced to buy the latest Kindle.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Already, there is the
“supported devices” list on Amazon’s website. From an engineering standpoint, it should take little
effort to prevent anything published after a given date from being delivered to any device that is
older than a given version. This decision might not even be made in bad faith; it might simply be
because newly published books have some cool feature and the effort required to make the book
backward compatible is not justifiable because the number of people using these old devices is few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more and more real-life scenarios which will affect physical things, and not just the
connecting tissue between software and hardware like our screens. Internet of Things devices like
Google Home are configured to integrate with the lights in a house and its security system. If the
security system does not integrate with Amazon Alexa, tough luck. You will just have to stick with
whatever you already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I want to stay away from these kind of services. But I recognize that I will be in the
minority, as I have started feeling in the smart speaker boom. When I was buying home appliances,
the campaign at the electronics store gave away Google Home smart speakers to anyone who wanted it
and was buying something else. It is hard to ask people to refrain from taking something that is
being given to them for free. Certainly, high-minded arguments about privacy will not work. The
simpler economic argument that there is no “free lunch” is slightly more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the metaverse is where the entertainment of the future is going to come from, people will have
little choice or say in the matter. Much as the television and the Internet changed society without
a vote, the present status-quo will change and future technologies will all appear without any
debate. The &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/18/unstoppable-march-of-technology&quot;&gt;lack of technological progress&lt;/a&gt; is only going to be seen as a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t need and should not use “upload and forget” one-click solutions. We need tools that whose
operation is familiar and configurable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What we need … is tools–not colleagues or friends. And yet technology companies learned long ago
that their products are far more appealing–and more profitable–when humans manage to bond with
them. As robots increasingly come to replace humans in retail and food services, these humanoid
touches begin to seem especially sinister. Walmart, one of the companies that recently began using
robots in its stores, is already implementing training programs to help their employees transition
into other sectors, knowing that the number of retail positions will soon decline as machines take
over.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.112, God, Human, Animal, Machine (O’Gieblyn, Meghan)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some might argue that the product has actually become less easy to use in the past few years. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I had the chance to see this feature in action and I am stunned by how good it is at identifying pictures of babies and matching them with adults. When it worked with nearly 5 years of photographs, I could not identify a single mistake in its recognition. This feature &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; made me feel like I was missing out on something big by not using Google Photos. I can see the power of a Photos product which can identify people and tell you about them &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; when you are thinking about them. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I maintain a separate list of books locally. And I export all my notes to CSV files and store them myself. So, I am not worried about losing the notes or the library’s list of books. But I am worried about losing the books themselves. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Keyboard Logs</title>
   <link href="/2022/08/06/the-keyboard-logs"/>
   <updated>2022-08-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/08/06/the-keyboard-logs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been experimenting with keyboards for the past several years and in February this year, I
switched to a keyboard which I hope will be the last keyboard I &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; buy. The whole point of
switching keyboards all this while was to buy the right version of this keyboard, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ergodox-ez.com/&quot;&gt;the Ergodox EZ&lt;/a&gt;. It
is a split keyboard with an ortholinear layout. It is an expensive keyboard and can be customized to
an (almost) limitless extent. It has several extra keys which can be programmed to do whatever you
want them to such as function keys or macros. This post is a log of the keyboards I bought (and sold
off) during this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;basics&quot;&gt;Basics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some common terms which are used &lt;strong&gt;constantly&lt;/strong&gt; in the discussion of keyboards, and
mechanical keyboards in particular. I don’t want to re-explain these topics here.  I will link to
short explainers about each term:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;goal&quot;&gt;Goal&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/keyboard-logs/ergodox-ez.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to pick the right type of key switches for this keyboard. This keyboard can be customized
to do a lot of things, but the key switches inside it can not be changed inexpensively. So, I wanted
to get this key switch choice right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keyboard uses the “split” form factor with an ortholinear layout. I wanted to find out how much
the split layout improved my posture and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the ortholinear layout itself. I wanted to understand whether having the keys directly
above and below each other, instead of the typical staggered layout is helpful at all. Switching
from the staggered layout to the ortholinear layout is a large investment as it requires one to
unlearn years of muscle memory using standard staggered layout keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these goals in mind, I started searching for similar keyboards which were cheaper and could
give me a feel for what using the Ergodox would really be like. I found out about the Ergodox EZ
some time in 2020 when everyone started working from home and started talking &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; about their
work setup. My keyboard journey starts well before that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;first-keyboard-2014-2016&quot;&gt;First Keyboard (2014-2016)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/keyboard-logs/logitech-mk-270r.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;August 14, 2014: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.logitech.com/en-ph/products/combos/mk270r-wireless-keyboard-mouse.920-006314.html&quot;&gt;Logitech MK270r Wireless Combo Keyboard (Membrane)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking around for a keyboard in my second year of college, I saw that the Logitech keyboard combo
was widely used by my peers. (I had spent the first year of college using my laptop’s in-built
keyboard. I had stayed away from my laptop for the most part of my freshman year anyway, so the
keyboard did not matter as much.) This combo connected to the computer using a LogiTech USB dongle.
I saw it around almost constantly, and I felt better investing in a brand which I knew about
already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a membrane keyboard. This means that there is a single membrane between the switches. When
a key is pressed, it touches an electrical contact on the membrane, which in turn touches the
underlying circuit board and transmits the required signal. All the keys are working on the same
membrane and bending it when they are pressed. This means that the actuation force (the force
required to send the signal) is variable. It is also higher than mechanical keyboards (The
membrane’s resistance is quite high.) The force required to actuate each key is variable and depends
on the quality of membrane. But the actuation force varies between &lt;a href=&quot;https://deskthority.net/wiki/Membrane_keyboard#Pressure_actuation&quot;&gt;65 and 75 grams&lt;/a&gt;, with cheaper
keyboards requiring more force to actuate the keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actuation force is the force that you must apply on each key when you are pressing it as you
type. If you are typing a typical e-mail or a Slack message, it might be about a 100 words, which
might be about 400-500 characters. This would mean that you have to apply about 65 grams of force
500 times, or 32.5 kg of force for a single message. This number seems quite high. When I was not
typing too much with my membrane keyboard, I did not have any pain in my wrist or my fingers. My
setup in college was highly un-ergonomic and so I could not really blame my keyboard for any other
pain that I did have. (I did not use an office chair and I was mostly sitting without any back
rest.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, towards the beginning of 2016, as I finished my third-year in college and entered my
fourth year, I started feeling the stress in my fingers. In my third-year, I prepared for interviews
for landing internships and worked at my first remote internship. During this time, I noticed that
the membrane keyboard was &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; taking a toll on my hand. Every time I would stop typing or take
a break, I could clearly see that my hands were fatigued and I had to work through the pain for a
period of time. This intense period of typing during the first half of 2016 convinced me that I
needed a better setup and I started searching for this setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;getting-on-the-mechanical-keyboard-train-2016-2018&quot;&gt;Getting On The Mechanical Keyboard Train (2016-2018)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/keyboard-logs/tvs-e-keyboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;July 14, 2016: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tvs-e.in/keyboards-and-mice/gold-bharat/&quot;&gt;TVS-e Bharat Gold PS2 Wired Keyboard (Mechanical) (Cherry MX Blue)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanical keyboards seemed to be the universal answer to pain in the fingers and wrist induced by
typing. As I started looking for the models that were available in India, I started realizing that
all of them were expensive. In fact, I could not find anything which was cheaper than INR 10,000
during the time. I was in college and I did not want to spend so much money on a keyboard which may
or may not solve my pain problems. So, I kept looking. About a month after starting my search, I ran
into this TVS Electronics keyboard on Amazon. It seemed to be too cheap to be real. At INR 2000, it
was far cheaper than anything else I had seen on Amazon or on YouTube. (The Indian tech YouTuber
scene in 2016 was not as good as it is now, so I was able to find reviews and comparison videos only
from American YouTubers, where mechanical keyboards had been popular for a few years.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brand TVS is well-known inside India for making automobiles, but I have never heard about TVS
manufacturing any computer peripherals. So, I was suspicious of this product. There was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tvs-e.in/keyboards-and-mice/gold-bharat/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;
for the product which described it well. The version that was available on Amazon used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS/2_port&quot;&gt;PS/2
port&lt;/a&gt;, a port designed 30 years ago, in 1987! Keyboards had moved on to USB a few years ago and to
Bluetooth in the couple years before I purchased this keyboard. So, the technology was quite old. I
could not find many reviews on the Internet for this product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it seemed to be my only bet and after confirming that I would be able to return the
product, I ordered it off of Amazon. After using it for a couple days, I was convinced that the
product was legit and actually did use &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; Cherry MX Blue keys. In fact, the keyboard was
extremely good and I started using it exclusively immediately after purchasing it. I used it
throughout my pre-final and final year when I had to type &lt;strong&gt;a lot.&lt;/strong&gt; I typed both my Bachelors and
Masters thesis on this keyboard. I also used it for all of my college placement preparation: writing
CVs, practicing competitive coding questions on CodeChef, notes about my placement experience, a
large part of this block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For nearly two years until my graduation in May 2018, I used this keyboard everyday. I was living
alone in a hostel room for the whole of this period, so the sound that the Cherry MX Blue switches
made was not a problem. I did not move around during this period either (Indeed, there was very
little travel.) So, the weight of the keyboard was not a problem either. This keyboard remains one
of my favorite keyboards to use. The product I bought in 2016 still remains in heavy use in my
father’s home office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-to-japan-2018-2020&quot;&gt;Moving to Japan (2018-2020)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/keyboard-logs/gamdias-hermes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;October 24, 2018: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/GAMDIAS-Hermes-E2-Mechanical-Anti-ghosting/dp/B074V3XZ1Z&quot;&gt;Gamdias Hermes E2 7 color (Mechanical) (Cherry MX Blue)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As good as the TVS-e keyboard is, the one thing it is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; is portable. Owing to the danger of
bringing it all the way from India to Japan and damaging it &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; not finding a use for it, I left it
at my parents’ house before moving to Japan. I intended to buy a Cherry MX Blue keyboard after
arriving in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first payday in Japan, I went to an electronics store and bought this keyboard. It was a
Cherry MX Blue keyboard, which I managed to figure out using the translator application on my phone
and repeated confirmation with the store clerk. My only real consideration when buying the keyboard
was budget. I did not know the Gamdias brand very well, and I had not read many reviews about this
keyboard either. I decided in the store after comparing some keyboards and their prices. The other
keyboards were mostly targeted at the gaming audience and seemed to have too many backlights, that
could not be disabled. This keyboard also had an array of backlights, but they could be turned off
easily and this was the reason I chose it over the other options on display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing about this keyboard was that it had the JIS layout (and not the typical US layout). The
JIS layout is mostly similar to the US layout but there are some extra keys which are used only when
typing Japanese. Through some software tweaks on Linux and Mac OS, I was able to use this keyboard
effectively at home. Throughout 2018 and 2019, I was going to my office daily for work and I was
unable to use this keyboard there because it was too loud. This keyboard was pretty good for typing
at home, where I did a minority of my typing. Using this keyboard, for the first time, I realized
that all keyboards which use the Cherry MX keys are not created equal. Indeed, a mechanical keyboard
is made up of several parts and the keyswitch is a major one, but not the only factor to consider
when assessing the quality of a completed product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a (terrible) Apple keyboard at work, where I was typing a lot. That keyboard definitely gave
me some finger pain and I wanted to move away from that at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sold this keyboard on Mercari&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 3 years after I bought it for little lower than the price at
which I had bought it. (I am an employee at Mercari. Future references to Mercari will include a
footnote stating this.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;experimenting-with-the-split-form-factor-2019-2020&quot;&gt;Experimenting With The Split Form Factor (2019-2020)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/keyboard-logs/kinesis-freestyle-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;October 26, 2019: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-mac/&quot;&gt;Kinesis Freestyle 2 for Mac (Membrane)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to experiment with the split form factor. The idea with the split form factor is that the
keyboard does not have to be a single unit. It can be split into two pieces, which can be placed at
distance. This ensures that the hands don’t have to be squished close together into the typist’s
body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was constrained to using a membrane keyboard because I wanted to use the split form factor at
work, where I was doing a majority of my typing. (I had not started &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/09/book-review-take-smart-notes&quot;&gt;taking Smart Notes&lt;/a&gt; yet in 2019.)
There weren’t many membrane keyboards which had the split form factor. In fact, there were only a
couple that I can remember. Out of these, the Kinesis had good reviews. So, I bought a second-hand
one off of Mercari&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a marketplace app for second-hand goods. The price was good and there was
little risk in this purchase because if I did not like the keyboard I could simply sell off the
keyboard on Mercari once again, at a slightly lower price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used this keyboard at home for a couple weeks to become familiar with the layout. Getting used to
the split form factor was hard at first. The temptation to reach for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;H&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; on the wrong half
was strong. (I do not do “perfect” touch typing, where typists use only the assigned fingers for
each key. I would often “cheat” by using the left index finger for H or the right index finger for
G. This kind of cheating is easily forgiven on a non-split form factor because the keys are close to
each other; but it is unforgivable on a split keyboard, as it slows you down.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a month or so of usage, I was able to type on this keyboard at the same speed as I used to type
on previous form factors. However, there was a major flaw with the design of this keyboard: Although
it was using the split form factor, it did not change anything from the US keyboard layout. So, all
the modifier keys were on the extreme left of the keyboard (such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt;, often used in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ctrl+Tab&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Alt+Tab&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Esc&lt;/code&gt;, mapped to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Caps&lt;/code&gt;). The finger extension for my left pinky finger to reach
these keys was very large and strained my fingers. I had to take my left hand off the home-row when
I needed to use a modifier key. I had to take my right hand off when I wanted to use the mouse. This
flaw made the experience of using this keyboard beyond 2 months quite painful. I went back and forth
with this keyboard between my office and home for a few weeks each time; hoping against hope that I
would &lt;em&gt;get used&lt;/em&gt; to the layout and perhaps even get over the pain. Neither of this happened, and
typing on it remained a painful experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up selling this keyboard on Mercari&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Things changed quite a bit in terms of my work
environment in the beginning of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;trying-the-cherry-mx-brown-switches-2020-2022&quot;&gt;Trying The Cherry MX Brown Switches (2020-2022)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/keyboard-logs/filco-minila-air.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;April 2, 2020: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.sg/FILCO-Majestouch-Minila-Cherry-Keyboard/dp/B00F3V81VG&quot;&gt;Filco Minila Air (Mechanical) (Cherry MX Brown)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second week of February 2020, everyone in my office was sent home to continue working from
home full time. I was able to use my Cherry MX Blue switches constantly now, and this was quite a
good experience. But the loudness of the Cherry MX Blue switches created problems almost
immediately, &lt;strong&gt;even&lt;/strong&gt; though there was no on else in my home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Namely, I was unable to type during meetings. As it had become commonplace to have a Google Doc
opened and present it during a meeting, where everyone could take notes, this meant that I would not
be able to type unless I muted my own mic. So, I would not be able to type and speak at the same
time. This was a common pattern of my work back then, especially when I was brainstorming an idea or
a calculation with a coworker. I realized that the Cherry MX Blue switches were so loud that I could
not use them for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Meet’s technology was still being improved and it did not have the “background noise
cancellation” feature that it does in 2022. Even still, it seems unlikely that I would have been
able to get away with typing on a Cherry MX Blue switch during a meeting. Searching for a silent
version of the mechanical keyboard that I was using, I found the Red and Brown variants. I had heard
a about the Cherry MX Red and the Cherry MX Brown switches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MX Red switches are linear and do not have any tactile feedback. This was a no-go for me; half the
reason I was using a mechanical keyboard in the first place was the tactile feedback that I was
getting when I pressed a key. This tactile feedback let me know that I did not need to press any
longer. It had become a subconscious part of my typing experience and I did not think about it at
all anymore. Typing without the tactile feedback, even on a linear switch, would be hard, I
felt. The reason you need to apply a smaller actuation force on a mechanical keyboard is because you
get feedback when the key has been typed. If you take away this feedback, you are left guessing or
waiting for the screen to update you about whether you typed a key. This guessing process always
ends with typing more forcefully and getting it right all the time, rather than typing less
forcefully and not actuating the key sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking around for a Cherry MX Brown switch keyboard, I saw several large keyboards. The Filco
Minila Air keyboard is one that I saw at an electronics store and its small design intrigued me. Did
I &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; need the number pad? I used to use the number pad back then, but it involved taking my
hands away from the home row. I wanted to be a &lt;strong&gt;proper&lt;/strong&gt; typist, if at all possible. Getting rid of
the number pad seemed like a step in the right direction. The Minila Air had received good reviews
and seemed like a solid keyboard from a well-known manufacturer. So, I bought it and started using
it daily for work from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It solved my “can not type during meetings” problem. The MX Brown switches on the Filco were silent
enough that typing lightly during a meeting would go unnoticed. Even though it took me a few weeks
of practice before I could really type lightly enough reliably, I could see that the MX Browns were
significantly more silent compared to the Clicky MX Blues, which are &lt;strong&gt;loud enough to rouse people in
deep sleep with the characteristically sharp click sound.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MX Brown switches on the Filco also &lt;strong&gt;felt&lt;/strong&gt; better than the MX Blue switches on the cheaper
Gamdias that I was using before. Again, I felt that the switches were not the sole component that
mattered; the build of the keyboard and the manufacturer’s experience also mattered a considerable
amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An added advantage with the Filco Minila Air is its &lt;strong&gt;portability.&lt;/strong&gt; When I went back to India to work
for 3 months from there, I took it with me from Japan to India.  I also brought it back to Japan. I
brought the keyboard in my cabin baggage. I was afraid it would be broken in transit if I put it in
my checked-in baggage. This meant that I had to unpack the keyboard and keep it alongside my 2
laptops on 5 different occasions during the trip, 1 time in Japan and 4 times in India. The
experience of doing this in India was &lt;strong&gt;harrowing, to say the least.&lt;/strong&gt; (The severely limited supply of
trays in airport security check queues is a genuine crisis!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After returning to Japan, I knew that I was ready for the final step in my keyboard journey: An
ErgoDox EZ purchase with the Cherry MX Brown keys. Before going to that step though, I will digress
slightly and explain my brief experience in the build-your-own keyboard world in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;sidetrack-build-your-own-keyboard-misadventure-march-may-2021&quot;&gt;Sidetrack: Build-Your-Own Keyboard Misadventure (March-May 2021)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/keyboard-logs/soyuz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;March 20, 2021: &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.yushakobo.jp/collections/keyboard/products/soyuz&quot;&gt;Custom keyboard number pad kit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build-your-own keyboard world in Japan is extensive. I have a few coworkers who have “built”
their own keyboard. The process involves buying a circuit board, a microcontroller, the key
switches, and the key caps which will be fitted on top of the switches. Then, soldering all the
components together yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a small keyboard kit which, when assembled, would be a 10-key number pad. I don’t have any
use for a number pad, but I wanted a kit on which I could test whether I would be able to put
together a real keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This went &lt;em&gt;poorly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I had greatly overestimated my soldering skills (I thought I was “OK,” it
turned out that I was actually “terrible.”) And I had greatly underestimated the complexity of
working with hardware. In particular, the point at which I realized that soldering was not my cup of
tea was when I started soldering the microcontroller. The microcontroller has 12 pins and these are
small and extremely close to one another. So, one has to solder everything perfectly and ensure that
none of the soldered points are connected to each other, which would be a short circuit and would
hamper the microcontroller’s functioning significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After messing it up and trying to fix it, I decided to give up. I was left with the kit and some
soldering equipment which I had no use for anymore. The only thing I did learn from this process was
how keyboards look like under-the-keyswitches and the effort that goes into making a single keyboard
when they are made manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;buying-the-ergodox-ez-jan-2022&quot;&gt;Buying The Ergodox EZ (Jan 2022)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;January 22, 2022: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ergodox-ez.com/&quot;&gt;Ergodox EZ (Mechanical) (Cherry MX Brown)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here we are. About 7 years after starting this journey, I have finally reached a keyboard that
is sufficiently customizable and ergonomic for sustained daily use. I am continuing with the QWERTY
layout, despite evidence that proves that this layout is not very good and involves too much
finger travel. The keyboard version that I have bought does not have the names of keys printed
anyway, so the switch of the keyboard layout to something modern such as Colemak DH &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be in
the cards for me. However, I am not going to spend time on it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent a considerable amount of time getting my tooling to its current shape. There have been
misadventures along the way. They did not cost me much money, but they did take up some valuable
time that I could have saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I am glad to have started using mechanical keyboards and &lt;strong&gt;I can wholeheartedly
recommend the Ergodox EZ keyboard&lt;/strong&gt; to anyone who knows which switch they want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Book Review: Global Economic History (Allen)</title>
   <link href="/2022/07/29/review-global-economic-history-allen"/>
   <updated>2022-07-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/07/29/review-global-economic-history-allen</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Allen’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11569567-global-economic-history?from_search=true&amp;amp;from_srp=true&amp;amp;qid=uJtJAM2HGg&amp;amp;rank=1&quot;&gt;Global Economic History: A Very Short Introduction&lt;/a&gt; is a 200-page masterpiece. It packs a
huge amount of history. It looks far enough into the past to set the scene for the Industrial
Revolution and the economic gains seen as a result of it. Then, Allen retreats into the fundamentals
of economic development and goes over the main reasons some countries are perennially stuck in the
“middle income trap.” He has some advice for such economies and what they might be able to do to get
out of this trap. This book is solidly based in data. But Allen does not prioritize data over the
story. Economics is the story of real people who live in each of these countries. Allen never loses
sight of this, and always puts large economic shifts in context by stressing on how it impacts
everyday life. This emphasis on personal experience makes the book a study in the government
policies that work and the pitfalls to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topics is quite deep and consequently, this post is long. I have categorized it into multiple
sections for the reader’s convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduction: I start with an introduction of the world economy and the large shifts that have
been seen over the past few centuries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Standard model for economic development and the industrial revolution in Britain: In modern times,
this remains the largest fundamental change in the way people worked and the way their lives were
organized, with people moving from villages to cities and leaving farming for industries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 topics related to middle-income economies
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The middle-income trap&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Why literacy must be perceived as useful for people to send their children to school&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How imported technologies and their adaptation is essential for economic development&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The big-push industrialization model for economic development&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Africa’s woes: Finally, I talk (briefly) about the African region’s woes and some reasons for the
lack of development in that region since 1820, and why it remains the poorest region on the
planet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic history of the whole world is a nearly intractable subject. Allen begins with a table
that shows the difference between the present and the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Region&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;GDP per capita in 1820&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;GDP per capita in 2008&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Multiplier&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;UK&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1,706&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;23,742&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;13.91&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;US&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1,202&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;30,152&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;25.08&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Japan&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;669&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;22,816&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;34.10&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;666&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7,614&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;11.43&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;China&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;600&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6,725&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;11.20&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;India&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;533&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2,698&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5.061&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;415&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1,387&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3.34&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countries that were rich in 1820 continue to be the richest of the lot. Nothing surprising
there, those countries had a head start. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region that has grown the least
in the intervening 2 centuries. But the numbers look encouraging, right? Allen dives into the
details of what these numbers mean and what one should take away from the development paths that
these economies have taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few centuries, the trajectory is easier to visualize. Between 1500 and 1800, European
powers discovered many regions on the planet and colonized those regions. Most of the trade in the
world was done by colonial powers who imported products produced in their colonies. In 1750, China
and India dominated world production with a 33% and 24% share of the total production respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After industrialization kicked off in Britain, products were produced in Britain and exported to the
world. These products were much cheaper than those manufactured in the colonies (such as cloth from
China and India compared to the cloth made in Britain, using the cotton mill.) As the cheaper
products took over market share from China and India, Britain’s economy strengthened at the cost of
China and India’s development. Until the 1990s, their share of global production kept declining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The colonisers had another advantage:&lt;/strong&gt; Not only did they produce cheap goods using modern
technology, they also controlled the prices of competing goods. So, Britain could take a commodity
like salt, which can be cheaply produced in India, and use import tariffs to ensure that salt
imported from Britain is cheaper than salt produced in India. This diabolical use of colonial power
was the reason for the “head-start” which colonial powers gained. They were able to destroy their
competition and they could compel their customers to buy from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India, after independence, from 1947 until Liberalization efforts in 1991, the economy struggled to
grow. China was stuck under Mao’s disastrous implementation of communism which lead to the death of
millions. Starting in the late 1980s, China started catching up &lt;strong&gt;very quickly.&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, most of the
world’s improvement in the 4 decades between 1980 and 2020 can be attributed only to China’s
growth. India was never able to capitalize on this trend of East Asia’s economic strengthening in
the 21st Century, and thus, was never able to recover from the colonial collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking into the future, it is clear that China will soon overthrow the US as the largest economy in
the world. &lt;strong&gt;When that happens, the world would have come full-circle.&lt;/strong&gt; (India would have missed the
bus to make this cycle work and will be stuck in the middle income trap.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did the Industrial Revolution happen in Britain, and not in India or China or Germany? &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is
the key question of economic development. Allen tries his best to convince us that geography and
access to resources was the driving force of the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;standard-model-of-economic-development&quot;&gt;Standard Model of Economic Development&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard model of economic development was followed by US, UK, Japan, and partly, by the
USSR. The idea is that a country can not advance itself by only exporting surplus agricultural
produce, so it should take steps to ensure that it has comparative advantage on some products. It
should import what can not be produced cheaply locally and it should export what can not be
produced at a lower cost elsewhere. To produce more and more things locally and at a discount to its
global rate and shipping cost, it should import technologies from more advanced economies and
protect businesses in their early stage until these businesses can learn to innovate on the imported
technology and improve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go from being a primarily agrarian economy to a primarily industrial one, countries will
generally start with cheap capital. There is a need for &lt;strong&gt;a banking system&lt;/strong&gt; which will invest in
development inside the country.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This capital is then used to build the requisite infrastructure around the country: roads and
railways. During the building of this essential infrastructure, the country will develop &lt;strong&gt;local
industries&lt;/strong&gt; for manufacturing of materials such as steel and the &lt;strong&gt;operational knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; for
running railways, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As the infrastructure is coming up, countries will incentivize the creation of new businesses and
the manufacturing of more and more things domestically. During this period, the products that are
manufactured domestically will be inferior and expensive compared to the “state-of-the-art”
elsewhere. However, governments must implement &lt;strong&gt;import tariffs&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure that imported goods do
not compete with domestically produced goods. The only way to foster industry in the early days
is by protecting it from competition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As industries inside the country find their footing with manufacturing and are able to import
technologies and adapt them to local settings, they will figure out cheaper ways to produce what
was being imported from other countries. This will increase the competitiveness of their products
abroad and the economy will enter a virtuous cycle of innovation and competitive production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This standard model worked very well for Britain, because it had cheap capital and cheap coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model worked for the rest of Northern Europe as well. Their proximity to Britain and their
colonies bolstered their ability to catch up to the fast industrializing Britain. Some European
economies were even able to overtake the British economy in the industrialization race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked very well for the other independent economies that were trying to develop during the time
of Empires: The US was able to keep British goods out by implementing tariffs. The US also had
practically free land, as the British colonies on the East Coast started expanding into the Wild
West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked well for Japan: Japan had cheap capital and the ability to adapt technologies which were
imported from the West to fit local restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this model did not work for the colonies. As it is, colonizers do not want colonies to
develop &lt;em&gt;too much.&lt;/em&gt; Colonizers will produce many things cheaply in their own countries and start
pushing them into the colony. This prevents businesses in the colony (if these are allowed to exist)
from ever having the protective environment that is required to start producing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of building infrastructure, again, the colony is seen merely as a market for the
colonizer’s goods and nothing is manufactured locally. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146077.The_Great_Hedge_of_India&quot;&gt;The Great Hedge of India (Moxham)&lt;/a&gt;,
Moxham demonstrates how the British deviously used tariffs to ensure that salt produced in India
would be sold at the same rate as salt imported from Britain. When railroads were laid in India,
nearly 61,000 km of railway tracks were laid by the British using British steel. India was never
able to develop her muscles in the large-scale manufacturing industry, which is a requisite for
entering the next stage of economic development. &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is the reason the standard model never
worked for colonies and they had to start from scratch when they became independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things got much worse after World War 2. The standard model stopped working. The global banking
system had become too interconnected for capital to be invested in new economies and be cheaper
relative to the cheap labor that was available in these economies. Some misguided protectionism
after the war lead to stagnation and an utter lack of accumulation of knowledge or skills in the
developing economies. When the economy was opened up after this period of protectionism, countries
realized that they were forced to import most products that they needed due to the principle of
comparative advantage. All of this culminated in the stagnation that Allen calls the “Middle Income
Trap.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large institutions like the IMF, World Bank, European Union have made institutions
in African countries which have not paid off because these institutions want to push the “free
market” idea into small, maturing economies. Only large economies such as India and China were able
to ignore World Bank advice, while economies like Pakistan and Sri Lanka had to follow this advice,
and now, their economies are on the brink of collapse. This is covered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6372440-this-time-is-different?from_search=true&amp;amp;from_srp=true&amp;amp;qid=7Ly3j1Ib5B&amp;amp;rank=1&quot;&gt;Reinhart’s “This Time Is
Different.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard model also relies on the Minimum Efficient Size (MES) of innovations. For every
innovation, it is worth investing in the innovation only if the factory that uses it produces at the
MES.  When Latin America tried to apply the standard model in 1980, the MES of state-of-the-art
innovations had skyrocketed. A single factory of MES size would be enough to serve all the domestic
demand. This stifled the need for innovation and a monopoly was an efficient solution in this
situation. But a monopoly does not foster innovation or competition, and is bad for a country’s
economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;industrial-revolution&quot;&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Industrial revolution in Britain was a key turning point for the West. They had already gone
from being mere monarchies to colonizers; but industrialization gave them the incentive to double
down on colonization and squeeze colonies of any chance of development. Cheap coal, cheap capital,
and high wages came together to make Britain the center of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prohibitively high cost of labor and the relatively cheap cost of capital pushed research
forward in several domains and Britain ended up improving the production process of many goods. The
leading producers of these goods were often countries that Britain had already colonized, so they
were able to squeeze the colonies from both ends: reducing production in the colonies through
British brawn, while improving production processes at home through British brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen goes through an impressive list of innovations which all came out of Britain during this
period. While the list may be impressive in itself, it should always be kept in mind that
colonization and the attendant atrocities were the prerequisites for these innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cotton:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese and Indian cotton was surprisingly competitive in Britain, even as late as the
1770s. And in West Africa, British cotton was far too expensive. The spinning jenny and the mule
made sense in Britain’s high wage environment. They gave a total return of 40% when employed in
Britain. Whereas in France, the return was 9% and in India, it was a meager 1%. So, India saw no
mechanization of cotton spinning. As the installation of these machines kick-started future
improvements in cotton spinning, the setback faced in this period was of colossal proportions for
India and other countries where labor was cheap.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Looms:&lt;/strong&gt; Wages in America had surpassed Britain in the early 1830s. So, as expected, Power
looms were embraced with much more gusto in America than across the Atlantic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steam Engine:&lt;/strong&gt; The initial coal requirements for introducing a steam engine were very high. In
the cheap coal environment in Britain, this was not a problem at all. Research continued steadily
and significant improvements were made. In &lt;strong&gt;1730&lt;/strong&gt;, Newcomen engines required &lt;strong&gt;20 kgs of
coal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to generate 1 horsepower of energy. By the late &lt;strong&gt;1800s,&lt;/strong&gt; this number had gone down by
a factor of 40 to &lt;strong&gt;0.5 kgs of coal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; British innovators cut through the technological
frontier because they were the only ones who had access to the high initial requirements of
coal. If countries could not clear this initial barrier, they would be forced to import
technology from Britain at a premium. (This is what Japan did when railways were introduced in&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;British engineers are credited in Japanese railway museums with installing the first tracks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;and trains.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Railways:&lt;/strong&gt; Starting in 1830, the power of Steam engines was successfully applied to locomotives
which ran on iron rails. The network grew around Britain very quickly, increasing to &lt;strong&gt;10,000 km&lt;/strong&gt;
in 1850 and to &lt;strong&gt;25,000 km&lt;/strong&gt; in 1880. The locomotive was popular among passengers who wanted to
avoid bad, unpaved roads for long-distance travel. It was also a popular mode of transport for
general freight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ships:&lt;/strong&gt; The Steam engine transformed shipping. The sail lost ground and steam took over,
with ships carrying the coal required to power their Steam engines. Initially, the space required
to store the coal required for a cross-Atlantic journey was too high. However, as the weight of
coal required per horsepower plummeted, the steam engine became the most common way for powering
Atlantic crossings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While England had the first-mover advantage in the Industrial Revolution, the rest of the continent
caught up to Britain by the 1870s. Indeed, Germany and France had surpassed England in cheap steel
production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, during this furious period of innovation between 1770 and 1870, there were no major
inventions anywhere else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;escaping-the-middle-income-trap&quot;&gt;Escaping the Middle Income Trap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some countries are stuck in the “middle income trap.” A part of their population is always in abject
poverty and the doors of social mobility are permanently closed to them. Why do some countries get
stuck in this trap?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/global-economic-history-allen-middle-income-trap-2022-07-06-2103.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every country starts out with no real technology. They use the tools that have been used since
antiquity for the first part of their development. During this period, wages are low and
businesses have no incentive to invest in technology which will increase the productivity of each
worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the productivity does not rise, the total amount of product produced by the country does not rise
either&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; and the country is stuck in a trap. There is no “natural” way for an economy to get
out of this trap. The market is running efficiently by &lt;strong&gt;not innovating.&lt;/strong&gt; There &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be an external
stimulus to go from the “Vicious Cycle” to the “Virtuous Cycle” in the diagram above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few different paths that Allen describes. For each path, Allen describes a case where it
was successful in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first strategy is the most common method to get out of this trap. Some countries increase
workers’ wages. This creates incentive for business leaders to squeeze more product out of the
workers’ (now limited) time at work. This incentive will turn into innovative technologies which
are either invented or imported. This worked well in England where machines to spin raw cotton
into yarn kick started Industrialization.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second strategy is government investment. The government invests a huge amount of money in
businesses and forces them to modernize their infrastructure. This strategy was most effectively
used in recent years by China. The question remains, where should this money come from? For rich
European countries, this meant digging into their, coffers which had gotten rich through the
exploitation of their colonies. For poor countries or countries which did not colonize anyone, it
meant taking loans from foreign investors. There is a pitfall here though. When a country is
large enough and the central government is powerful enough to stamp out (unreasonable amounts of)
corruption and internal strife, foreign investors never gain enough power to exploit the
country. However, if the country is corruptible or its economy too small to make much of a dent,
it is ripe for exploitation by its debtors. Foreign debtors are greedy and can often push the
country into unwanted spirals of debt restructuring to the debtors’ benefit. So, being in debt
can be a dangerous strategy for some. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/world/americas/haiti-history-colonized-france.html&quot;&gt;infuriating story&lt;/a&gt; of France’ exploitative arrangements
with Haiti in order to collect the independence &lt;del&gt;debt&lt;/del&gt; ransom is a classic example of an
economy which was exploited by its debtors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The final strategy is brute-force improvement of productivity through increased work hours and
technological adaption. The adaption of imported technologies is important for economic growth
and there are many instances in the past where it is clear that countries that can adapt imported
technologies fair better than those which import technologies and try to use them as is, without
redesigning them for local economic conditions. Asian economies which flourished and reached the
top of the world economy after World War 2 are prime examples of this technique: Japan, South
Korea, and Taiwan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;incentives-to-become-literate&quot;&gt;Incentives to Become Literate&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literacy is good.&lt;/strong&gt; It informs the population, enables them to choose better leaders (until
recently, at least), and increases the opportunities that ordinary citizens get. In the TV show
Downton Abbey, an undercook learns mathematics and history from a local school teacher. Soon after,
we see that her confidence increases and she feels comfortable saying out loud that she does not
&lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to be an undercook all her life. &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is the character of social mobility: If you want to
convince a majority of your population that becoming literate is good for them, then they &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; see
the benefits first hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northern Europe saw significant increases of literacy by the 19th century. Most of these increases
were powered by the imperialism that had become essential for most European nations. As imperialism
advanced, these countries became rich and products that were imported from China were soon produced
cheaply at home due to industrialization. The demand for these cheap products went up and wages
increased as people saw that there was use for their money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As wages increased, parents sent their children to school and children studied as they could clearly
see that educated people had better opportunities in a fast industrializing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Literacy in 1500&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Literacy in 1800&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;England&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;53%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Germany&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;35%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;France&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;37%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Italy&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;9%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;22%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Spain&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;9%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts were taken to keep children in school because the economy demanded literate
participants. For e.g., in the American settlement, literacy was a considerable advantage after
America’s independence in 1776. State schooling and mandatory attendance were introduced in America
almost immediately after independence, and trade with Europe continued unhindered. Children went to
school and literacy spread because it was economically advantageous. On the other hand, in Mexico,
only 20% of the population, almost all of the White men, were literate. The remaining population,
mostly non-White peasants, did not see any economic advantage to becoming literate. This held them
back. While the highly literate men in America had access to journals and magazines about increasing
crop yield, the peasants in Mexico slogged away using methods that had been used by their
forefathers. (Due to the nature of colonization, even &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; there had been a demand for universal
education, it would most certainly not have been provided by the ruling class.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main takeaway for me was that it is important to *convince the population that the benefits that
literacy will accrue to the children far outweigh the costs to parents and the time spent by
children in schools.* Parents also need to be convinced that the sacrifice of free labor on the
family farm is worth it. This fundamental equation has been forgotten in some countries. Even in
India, where the government claims 100% literacy using a low bar for literacy (being able to sign
your own name), the government’s willingness to bolster the education system has been
half-hearted. At several points during the Covid19 pandemic, schools were closed while malls,
restaurants and factories were open. Most schools in India are not air conditioned and they are well
ventilated through open windows. Given the pandemic’s known patterns of spreading, keeping schools
open should have been the foremost priority for the Indian government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been noticed, over several years, that students who drop out of school in India rarely return
at a later stage in life. Their chances at social mobility are affected significantly, and they are
stuck doing low productivity jobs such as being a car mechanic or a repair technician: Their
literacy helps them with these jobs which involve a lot of traveling in the hot sun but no gaining
of knowledge or marketable skills. Their limited experience with formal education limits their
ability to grow further, such as setting up their own repair shop or employing a few people in order
to run a service business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advent of the gig economy has been seen as a boon by many, because most workers in the gig
economy need only a driving license and do not need any skills as such. But this could end up
becoming the reason for an increasingly literate society to regress back to its illiterate
origins. The temptation of quick money made by delivering orders for food delivery apps often
overcomes the long-term benefits of education. The Indian government should clamp down on the gig
economy by introducing strict requirements for contractual workers, including limits on working time
and minimum wages irrespective of demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;adaptation-of-imported-technologies&quot;&gt;Adaptation of Imported Technologies&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the key concepts in this book. Due to reasons that Allen goes into in detail, the
“Standard Model of Going from Middle Income to Higher Income” is no longer viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an obvious statement: Inventions &lt;strong&gt;can not&lt;/strong&gt; be transported as-is across time or space. The new
technology must be adapted to local conditions before it can be used widely and create economic
development. &lt;strong&gt;How many governments are nimble enough to notice this?&lt;/strong&gt; Not many, as Allen elaborates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan was a country which had a lot of cheap labor. Labor saving inventions were discarded
immediately, because they did not solve any existing problem. Instead, while the cotton mill was
powered by steam in England because coal was cheap there, it was powered by humans in Japan. While
mills were run for only 12 hours a day in England due to the culture of labor laws there, in Japan,
the mills were run for 24 hours through 2 shifts of employees. (Once again, as labor was cheap in
Japan, it made sense to hire people. Whereas in England, the limiting factor was labor and there was
no point in running the mill for 24 hours because the extra labor was too expensive for the final
product to be cost-effectively produced.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India, on the other hand, was a part of the British Empire. India did not implement the 24-hour mill
adaptation. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;even though&lt;/strong&gt; labor was cheap in India, the mills were idle for half the day. This
hampered the growth of the cotton industry in India, as the capital invested in these mills sat
unused for half the time and took twice as long to pay back dividends to their owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his discussion of why industrialization began in Europe and why England had an advantage, Allen
points that England had 2 things which were not there in any other Northern European economy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cheap capital (to invest in new technologies and machines)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cheap coal (to power the new technologies and machines)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two advantages were decisive and enabled the start of the industrialization. On top of this,
labor was expensive relative to capital and coal. So, businesses found it lucrative to invest
capital in machines and train their workers and increase each worker’s productivity, as compared to
hiring more workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;big-push-industrialization&quot;&gt;Big Push Industrialization&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw, the Standard model for economic developments is defunct now. So, what is the solution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen is optimistic: He says that Asia’s economies have grown through Big-Push Industrialization and
that other economies can, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of Big Push Industrialization is inherently unstable because it is based on a leap of
faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Procure cheap capital&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build everything that is required for industrialization simultaneously (i.e. Capital is invested
in steel production and automobile production at the same time.) &lt;strong&gt;Make a leap of faith that the
dependencies of every effort will be completed in time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Institute a planning authority that reinforces this faith. (i.e. It convinces car manufacturers
that the steel they require will be produced domestically by the time they have figured out how
to produce a car. It allocates funds to the steel industry to make sure that this promise is
actually met.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 Asian economies employed this model successfully and closed the gap to the West in a single
generation: Japan, China, Taiwan, and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;japan&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After World War 2, Japan closed the gap to the West in a single generation. Between 1950 and 1990,
average annual growth rate was 5.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The products that were being produced were steel and automobiles. State-of-the-art steel production
technologies were imported. These technologies were capital intensive, but making a leap of faith,
the capital was invested with the belief that there would be a market for the finished good. When
the steel was used to produce automobiles, these factories were forced by central planning to be of
at least Minimum Efficient Size. The produced cars were exported to America and caused a crash for
domestic automobile production in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would have been a terrible result for any other economy, as the US could have easily imposed
import tariffs and prevented Japanese cars from appearing on US roads. But Japan’s delicate position
in Asia as a US outpost guaranteed its freedom to trade its goods in the US.  After the Second World
War, America had emerged as the most competitive economy. Japan’s fortune in securing its place as a
seller in the American economy ensured demand for its cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;china&quot;&gt;China&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No modern success story comes close to China’s. Production per capita in China went from &lt;strong&gt;$284 in
1988 to $10,500 in 2020.&lt;/strong&gt; This 36-fold increase in 32 years is phenomenal and unmatched in any other
economy of comparable size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not &lt;em&gt;just statistics,&lt;/em&gt; either. The effect on people has been stunning too. The percentage
of population living below the global poverty line of $1.90 per day went down from 66.3% in 1990 to
0.1% in 2019 in China. Meanwhile, during the same period in India, the value went down from 50.6% to
22.5%.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching from percentages to absolutes, we see the number of people who are affected. This table
shows the number of people who were below the poverty line in 1993 and 2011.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;China&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;668 million&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;106 million&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;India&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;441 million&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;281 million&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1992, Central Planning was abolished in China. The remaining state forces guide the energy and
heavy industry economy, which continue to be central to China’s growth. Both of these have grown
constantly since the 1970s. Per capita income grew a whopping 6.7% every year between 1978 and
2006.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communal ownership of land meant that agricultural progress and its successes were more equitably
shared across China. In India, small farms were pushed out by businessmen who had easier access to
capital and could employ the latest innovations easily. China has managed to keep farms of all sizes
alive, while small farms in India have retreated back to a subsistence level of life. The government
has also had to step in and invest a large chunk of its capital into supporting farmers, the largest
voting bloc in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China comes closer and closer to the technological frontier, the state has been loosening its
grip over enterprises so that market factors can gain control and enterprises are nimble to changes
in the market. If this trend of adaptation continues, then China’s businesses and the Chinese
Communist Party should be able to navigate the next phase of the country’s economic development
successfully; possibly returning China to the place it occupied in the world, before Vasco De Gama
and Columbus set out to find the new world, as &lt;strong&gt;the largest manufacturing economy in the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;africas-woes&quot;&gt;Africa’s Woes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/share/widget?contextual=default&amp;amp;indicators=NY.GDP.PCAP.CD&amp;amp;locations=ZF-IN-CN-JP-US-GB&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most popular argument I have read about why Africa remains the least industrialized continent
relates to geography and its history. Allen puts forth a similar convincing argument: &lt;strong&gt;Geography and
Colonialism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geography matters a lot. And in particular, the proximity to Northern Europe mattered the most. The
ability to have a flourishing sea trade with Europe was the deciding factor for growth after the
Industrial Revolution because Northern Europe was the most advanced region on the planet and
reliable demand for your goods there would be a confirmed ticket into the global economy. However,
the sea trade between Africa and Europe never flourished because the distances were prohibitive. The
same fact affected South America. South America’s sea ports were farther from Northern Europe than
those on North America’s Eastern coast (such as Philadelphia.) So, if the same product was to be
exported from both ports, the demand would undoubtedly be higher for the export from Philadelphia
because it was closer to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colonialism in Africa started in 1800s and split up the continent by the late 1800s. The most common
problem was that European imperialists split up African countries into cities and tribal
regions. The cities were ruled directly by the imperialists, whereas the tribal regions had village
chiefs as before. The imperialists also set up low tariffs to ensure that European goods would be
imported and sold to Africans, and nothing would be produced locally. &lt;strong&gt;The effects of colonialism
were much worse in Africa than in any other part of the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land expropriation was also another huge problem for the African natives. Before the imperialists,
land in Africa was basically worthless. Little effort was required to cultivate the land, so most
communities were able to sustain subsistence levels of living without much effort. However, once the
Europeans had established their rule on the continent, they started taking land away from the
natives through imperialist decrees. For e.g., the British passed an act which gave 2/3rds of South
Africa’s population the right to lease only 7% of the land in that country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a combination of low tariffs and low wages have pushed Africa into a trap which it has found
impossible to get out of. &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/?locations=IN-ZG-ZF&quot;&gt;Wages remain low, productivity remains low too.&lt;/a&gt; Most of the cocoa in the
world is produced in Africa, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/cocoa&quot;&gt;export prices continue to be low&lt;/a&gt;. There is no incentive to improve
productivity or to employ technology instead of manual labor when wages are low. Africa’s story is a
depressing one: &lt;strong&gt;It is the story of a continent which was unable to escape the Middle Income Trap.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Using TikTok for 1 Month</title>
   <link href="/2022/07/18/using-tiktok"/>
   <updated>2022-07-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/07/18/using-tiktok</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;TikTok is the most talked about social media platform now. Articles about the impact it is having
are published regularly in mainstream publications. People are constantly writing editorials about
what it is, how it became popular, how it is owned by a Chinese company (and thus, controlled by the
Chinese government), etc. I had read enough of it that I wanted to give it a try. I wanted to be a
viewer on TikTok for a week (originally) to understand what it is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like. I ended up being on
it for about a month. This was because I was not completely convinced that I had used all the
features in the product after a week. Then, I gradually realized what was really going on: &lt;strong&gt;TikTok
is incredibly simple; it requires no interaction from the user except for scrolling down.&lt;/strong&gt; It is
built with a singular focus on convincing people to imitate the trend that is “going viral” at any
given point.  There are many moving elements around the screen, and some of them are integrations
with other businesses, which TikTok or the creator possibly makes money from. I think that TikTok is
popular today because it solved a content creator’s &lt;strong&gt;biggest problem&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;The requirement to be
&lt;em&gt;original.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Nothing&lt;/strong&gt; is original on TikTok. Everything is a copy of a copy of a copy of a
copy. But these are not copies. They are &lt;strong&gt;participants in a trend.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-first-day&quot;&gt;The First Day&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installing the app, signing up, and following some accounts, I saw that there were two tabs on
the app. There was a Discover tab at the bottom of the screen. The search bar at the top had some
searches which were marked as “trending.”  Every time I opened the app, it opened on the “For You”
page, which had a video from a user that I did not follow yet. The “Following” page which has videos
from the people that I follow was deliberately harder to access than this “For You” page, where
TikTok’s algorithm puts content it thinks you want to see (and &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; will keep you hooked.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplicity of the app was stunning at first. I don’t say this lightly. I like plain text and
spend most of my time inside a text editor or in Firefox’ “Reader mode.” While watching Video, I use
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-recommended-videos/&quot;&gt;YouTube Unhook&lt;/a&gt; extension, which removes everything &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; the video’s title and the video from
the screen. TikTok appeared simple to me despite my meticulous attempt to exclude moving elements
from tools I use daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no text in TikTok. You can not read anything; there was &lt;strong&gt;nothing to read.&lt;/strong&gt; You could see
the first couple lines of the poster’s description, but only upto the 10th word or so. This was
useless anyway because it generally contained the same hashtags: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#foryou #fyp&lt;/code&gt;. This makes literacy
and option for TikTok users. This is also unlike other platforms where long essays about the topic
du jour are common. So, TikTok is really just a stream of videos which one would consume, much as
they would watch TV. There were the quintessential “Like”, “Save” and “Share” button. Every video
was set to some music, and the name of the music was in a chyron at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can search for people if you want, but it was clear to me that most people were meant to stay
inside the For You page and discover videos there. For a few minutes, I was not sure what I was
supposed to do. I have not watched TV in a long time, and I am used to watching content on
demand. Being shown arbitrary videos and not doing anything to tailor the experience felt &lt;em&gt;weird.&lt;/em&gt;
This app was different: No input was required from me. &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is perhaps the most jarring feature of
this application for people who are used to a non-TV world where you don’t watch anything you don’t
want to and content flows &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; after you enter a prompt of some sort. &lt;em&gt;Even&lt;/em&gt; YouTube has text that
you can read, search strings that you must enter, and video tiles that you must click before the
content starts flowing. That TikTok requires its users to do &lt;strong&gt;nothing at all&lt;/strong&gt; is a hearkening back
to the early days of radio and TV: Turning on the device opens the firehose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-next-few-days&quot;&gt;The Next Few Days&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, I got used to the daily ritual. At some point during the day when I had a
couple of minutes free (such as when I was waiting for some food to heat up), I would open the
TikTok application. It would always open on the &lt;strong&gt;For You&lt;/strong&gt; page, which was the first thing about the
app I found to be annoying. I realized that the “Following” feature exists only to provide a
“familiar” ground for users who are coming from other applications. TikTok content creators do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;
expect to have a loyal following. They expect their content to “go viral.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would swipe left to the Following tab and see content from the people I follow. One thing that is
(probably) intentional is that consecutive videos are often set to the same music. They are from two
different creators, using the same audio, and trying to do the same kind of dance in the video. So,
each creator’s individuality rarely comes through: Indeed, that is not the point and the platform is
built to emphasize that to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no pretense of the videos being spontaneous. Every video is studied and well-rehearsed. The
&lt;a href=&quot;https://genius.com/Roddy-ricch-the-box-lyrics&quot;&gt;tempo&lt;/a&gt; of some of the songs is so high that it is nearly impossible to perform any dance satisfyingly
on the first or even the tenth try. A lot of the dances that are performed are halfhearted attempts
from a user who is in a public space and uncomfortably glancing around at involuntary spectators (a
cafe or a park or a school). TikTok has not yet gotten rid of this last facet of inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some users are using the platform to post vlogs (video blogs). These are a few minutes long and
well-edited; the cuts are fast and a lot happens in a single video. There is little the user can
notice well enough to comment on. (There is no “contemplative” sequence where the user might think
about the content that has just been shown to them. There are no monologues where the creator
&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; lets the viewer in. It is like being in the lobby of a busy office and watching a lot of
deal closures and people handshaking, but not knowing exactly what people are happy / sad / excited
about.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;solving-the-requirement-of-originality-problem&quot;&gt;Solving the “Requirement of Originality” Problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of social media was a boon for people who are hoping to become popular and make money off
that popularity. It was a bane for people who are &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; popular or are going to be popular
through traditional routes: reality TV shows, movies, music, models. The problem was that the
mid-range celebrity had to now do this on top of everything else that they are already expected to
do: Create content on social media, have a lively feed for brands to see, and a loyal following for
brands to want to tap into. The number of followers is important for people who want to star in
their big break movie or participate in a photo shoot for a large brand or appear on the cover of a
magazine. The public’s adoration online is a proxy for competence among the agents who are looking
for new talent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyre_Festival#Celebrity_and_social_media_promoters&quot;&gt;Would you be paid to promote the Fyre festival if you did not have a large
following?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This group of “new wave” celebrities has to constantly make new content to stay relevant. Repetition
or reposting will not cut it. They &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; create “original content” to retain their
following. TikTok solved this problem and gave all mid-range celebrities a way out of the content
creation rat race. What if copying was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; taboo? What if copying an ongoing trend was &lt;strong&gt;expected&lt;/strong&gt;
by users and &lt;strong&gt;rewarded&lt;/strong&gt; by brands? What if the stakes of &lt;strong&gt;not creating&lt;/strong&gt; a new trend were lowered
enough to make it not worth the time of mid-range celebrities to come up with new trends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who started the ALS ice bucket challenge? I don’t know. I know what the challenge is. I know what
ALS is. The challenge ostensibly served its purpose. And it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1xWx5y1H6C4&quot;&gt;provided&lt;/a&gt; some ready made content
creation opportunities for those who are forced, due to their profession, to create content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TikTok provides these readymade content creation opportunities on an hourly basis. A mid-range
celebrity can maintain their following by practicing the dance that is trending right now, and
performing it for their followers. They don’t &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to come up with the dance. While the creation
of content might still take the same amount of time, the forced need to be creative is done away
with; as is the risk of messing up and offending your followers, a route many a celebrity have taken
with the wrong choice of words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;bucking-the-traditions-of-social-media&quot;&gt;Bucking the Traditions of Social Media&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few days of intense use&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I realized that this app gets rid of most of the “fluff” that is
expected from content on other social media platforms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Content should be original&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Content should have inherent meaning or purpose. The purpose can not be solely “I want this to go
viral.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Content should be discoverable through the user’s preferred path. Companies will build elaborate
search infrastructure. What if users understood, through product design, that searching was
discouraged? Please do not resist.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Content should be spontaneous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what remains? &lt;strong&gt;The main purpose of all content on TikTok is to “go viral.”&lt;/strong&gt; On TikTok, even
virality’s definition is constantly changing. Trends used to be a few weeks long. Now, trends come
and go in a couple days. So, if you were to not check your phone for a weekend, it is totally
possible that you completely missed a trend. Also, you will never know that the trend ever existed
because the next trend is probably already popular and users are posting content from that trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a strange way, TikTok actually makes the “Fear of Missing Out” on social media less
“world-ending,” even for heavy creators and users. When you don’t know what you missed, there is no
reason to be really guilty about not using the app for a few days. However, TikTok’s algorithm is
known to reward consistency. If you consistently provide free content to TikTok so that they can
show it to people and make money off it, they will put you in their feeds. So, the FOMO for users is
reduced significantly, while the FOMO for creators might be reduced only marginally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;absurd-and-unnecessary-sexualization-of-content&quot;&gt;Absurd and Unnecessary Sexualization of Content&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of content on TikTok is strangely sexual; that is, the content is much more sexual than the
demands of the content are. A dance that can be performed anywhere is performed at the beach. A
video that can be shot sitting still is shot while the subject is cutting a fruit in the kitchen. A
video that can be shot at any time of the day is shot when the subject is out on a run or in a
gym. A lot of content on TikTok is created by women. I am not sure whether it was my bias when
selecting people to follow or whether the content creators on TikTok are mostly female; mirroring
the general fact that men are heavier users of video platforms such as YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hypersexualized nature of content on the platform has been noticed by others. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/8YIpx&quot;&gt;alarmist
article from the conservative-leaning Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; was the only systematic study of the type
of content shown on the “For You” page that I could find. It mentions that TikTok has loosened its
policy and started allowing more sexual content in its feeds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Policing content has been complicated by the company’s decisions in recent years to loosen some
restrictions in the U.S., including around skin exposure and bikinis, according to several former
executives and content moderators.  The result has been more sexualized videos on the platform, the
people said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final comment that I would like to make is the apparent dissonance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/GsmHOoSAElA?t=325&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;feminist-leaning content
on TikTok.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is undoubtedly a sign of the increased prevalence of feminist viewpoints in wealthy
pockets of society. But how can one explain the self-objectification that is prevalent on TikTok?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remain confused by this question. Amia Srinivasan, the feminist thinker, who recently published
her collection of essays “The Right to Sex” tackles this in her essay, “Talking to My Students About
Porn”, Srinivasan explains how girls and women in the 2000s are outspoken about being feminists and
well-versed in identifying the injustices that are happening around (and to) them under the auspices
of patriarchy. They are articulate in their expression of dissatisfaction with the
status-quo. Despite this improvement in the feminist consciousness level among women, their sexual
conditions are worse than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The young women Orenstein discusses in Girls &amp;amp; Sex would have known, unlike my younger self, exactly
what to say. They would not have been ashamed, as I and all my friends were, to call themselves
feminists. How should we understand the relation between this raised state of feminist consciousness
among young women, and what appear to be their worsening sexual conditions: increased
objectification, intensified body expectations, decreasing pleasure, and shrinking options for sex
on their terms? Perhaps girls and young women are becoming more feminist because their worsening
circumstances demand it. Or perhaps, as Orenstein suggests, feminist consciousness is for many young
women a mode of false consciousness, which plays into the hands of the very system of sexual
subordination they take themselves to be opposing. Does a discourse of sexual empowerment and
autonomy mask something darker and unfree?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Amia Srinivasan in her essay “Talking to My Students About Porn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-does-tiktok-exist&quot;&gt;Why Does TikTok Exist?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money.&lt;/strong&gt; Why do gossip magazines exist? Why do “storytime” channels exist on YouTube? Why do
celebrities participate in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtl-Lc1y4YU&quot;&gt;72 Questions&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick look at the way TikTok makes money shows us who the real users are: The brands who pay
creators to promote their products. TikTok is a private company and not much is known about the
business, except for what can be garnered from the public statements of creators on the app. The app
remains free of ads as of July 2022.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of discourse on the Internet about how the real user is the advertiser and the users
who are using the product are pawns whose data is sold to the advertisers by the platform. I won’t
belabor the reader by repeating this discourse. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/sorry-everyone-on-the-internet-youre-always-the-product-77235&quot;&gt;This article from 2017&lt;/a&gt; explains the basics well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On TikTok, as on other platforms, content creators are paid for promoting products and
brands. These brands including fast-fashion brands like SheIn (which deserves a separate post of its
own) or other clothing brands like Sephora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-traditional-celebrities-takeover-is-not-coming-to-tiktok&quot;&gt;The Traditional Celebrities Takeover is Not Coming to TikTok&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every new social media platform that came around was quickly taken over by celebrities and news
outlets. Facebook and Twitter feeds are almost always full of posts from these media outlets and
personalities who employ large teams churning out content professionally and at a volume no
individual user or group of individual users can hope to match. &lt;strong&gt;Why hasn’t this happened on TikTok
yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the reason lies in the fact that there is no “reading” on TikTok. Unlike Facebook, Twitter
or YouTube, TikTok creators are not incentivized to send people out of the app. So, while TikTok
itself might show “promotions” which might send users out of the app (briefly), the same feature is
not extended to users. The description is too short to convey anything of value and it is incredibly
hard to create news or celebrity content that will sit well between two videos of a subject dancing
in the foreground and a fast-paced Pop song in the background. The cost of bad content is steep
because &lt;strong&gt;the next video is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; just a flick away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Goodbye Pi-hole. Hello CoreDNS.</title>
   <link href="/2022/06/12/goodbye-pi-hole-hello-coredns"/>
   <updated>2022-06-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/06/12/goodbye-pi-hole-hello-coredns</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I understand the economics behind advertising. Advertising can be used to subsidize
content. However, I refuse to accept that Bloomberg.com needs to show advertisements to a paying
subscriber.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This comes down to personal preference: If you believe that advertisements are a
net good and support the work that you are viewing “for free”, so be it. I do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; believe that. If
I must pay for content that is ostensibly “free” by having my attention distracted by an
advertisement which I did not ask for and am not interested in, then I reserve the right to use
every tool in my arsenal to avoid seeing the advertisement. All of this is just a preamble to a
recent change I made in one of the central components that I use to browse the Internet: my DNS
server. I switched from Pi-hole, a popular adblocking DNS server, to CoreDNS and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/blocker&quot;&gt;a plugin for ad
blocking&lt;/a&gt; which I wrote. This is a post about why I decided to &lt;strong&gt;reinvent the wheel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-should-you-run-your-own-dns-server&quot;&gt;Why Should You Run Your Own DNS Server?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/dns-diagram-2022-06-12.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNS (Domain Name System) is a key part of the infrastructure that makes up the backbone of the
Internet. It is also the most decentralized part of it. Most people use a DNS server which is a few
kilometers away from them. Internet Service Providers (ISP) will generally send default
configuration to their clients which will point them to DNS servers run by the ISP. This allows the
ISP to make a list of websites that their users are using and possibly use it as leverage when
negotiating with service providers &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.netflix.com/en/news/how-netflix-works-with-isps-around-the-globe-to-deliver-a-great-viewing-experience&quot;&gt;about preferential treatment&lt;/a&gt;. However, the clients that users use
to browse the Internet (their web browser or their computer’s operating system) have the ability to
override this setting and specify their own DNS server. Public DNS servers have been on the rise:
Google’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;8.8.8.8&lt;/code&gt; and Cloudflare’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.1.1.1&lt;/code&gt; are popular alternatives. These DNS servers have a
significant improvement: They are far more reliable compared to your local ISP’s DNS
server. However, data about your Internet traffic continues to be sent to &lt;em&gt;someone.&lt;/em&gt; To make the
situation worse, DNS traffic is mostly served over UDP. UDP is an insecure protocol which does not
protect information in transit. (Not “HTTPS,” if you will.) So, your ISP &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; has access to the
list of websites you are visiting. The solution to all of these problems is &lt;strong&gt;hosting your own DNS
server on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.com/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; computer&lt;/strong&gt; inside your home. (A recent improvement over the old design of
UDP-based DNS is &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/&quot;&gt;DNS-over-HTTPS&lt;/a&gt;. This ensures that DNS traffic can not be snooped upon, in transit.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there’s one advantage: &lt;strong&gt;Your DNS request, which contains the name of the website that you are
visiting, does not leave your home.&lt;/strong&gt; Your ISP has no clue where your traffic is going. (They can
figure it out using the IP address that your packet is headed for, but this is harder and ISPs have
a tendency to aim for the low-hanging fruit and not spend &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much time trying to track their
users, if the information is not handed to them on a platter.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another advantage: &lt;strong&gt;If you don’t like the domain inside the DNS request, then you can stop
the request in its tracks and prevent the client from fetching what it wants to fetch.&lt;/strong&gt; Your browser
loads a page (for example, a news website). The news website has a script which will call an
advertising server and request the ad which will be placed in the box in between paragraphs. If you
could identify &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; these requests to the advertising server and block them somehow, then the
website will not be able to show you ads!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/dns-blocking-diagram-2022-06-12.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea is to create a list of the IP addresses that are used by advertising servers around the
world and block any request which is bound to these servers. This is hard and not reliable enough
because IP addresses change a lot and the process for changing them can be easily automated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another idea is to list the domains which these servers are on and block any DNS request for these
domains! This approach is convenient and reliable: Changing domains is hard and even if domains are
changed, if you don’t want anything on the domain, then you can simply add the new domain to your
blocklist. (Changing domains is hard primarily because each new domain has to be registered with a
domain registrar and this requires a small fee. The fee must be paid and payment to vendors on
demand is hard to automate. Also, so few users are using ad-blocking DNS servers that the
return-on-investment for an automated domain changing system is limited.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we have a good approach. But we are missing one key component: The list of domains which we want
to block. There are many excellent lists out there and I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://oisd.nl/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. It lists about 1
million domains and it is updated frequently. It is an aggregation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://oisd.nl/includedlists&quot;&gt;other lists&lt;/a&gt; and works well. (I
have used it along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts&quot;&gt;another list&lt;/a&gt; for the past several months, and I have not had any domain
which I wanted to send traffic to blocked due to a domain being mistakenly added to the list.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we have a list of domains that we want to block and the approach that we are going to use to
block the domains (a DNS server which can look at this list and block requests which match a domain
in the blocklist.) Now, &lt;strong&gt;we need to search for the software which will implement our solution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-coredns&quot;&gt;Why CoreDNS?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many options. The most popular one is &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/&quot;&gt;Pi-hole&lt;/a&gt;, I used it for a few months and realized
that I could not continue using it because I disagreed with its GUI-centric design philosophy and
the effect that this philosophy had on its purpose: being a good DNS server. CoreDNS is a DNS server
which puts plugins front-and-center and encourages its users to write their own plugins. It is
written in a programming language that I like and am familiar with, and I don’t mind maintaining a
plugin in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pi-hole&quot;&gt;Pi-hole&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pi-hole is written in the programming language C. I chose it, as I believed that it was built for
running on a Raspberry Pi. (I did not research how it was built or why it would run well on a
Raspberry Pi.) It was fairly easy to set up on a Raspberry Pi. There were some manual steps during
the setup process and it could not be fully automated. However, this was not a big problem for me
because I did not believe that I would need to repeat this setup process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started noticing problems with Pi-hole almost immediately after setting it up. The main problem
seemed to be with its statistics reporting module. The sane way to report statistics is to provide
an API endpoint which can be scraped periodically. This API endpoint should either take the starting
time for statistics or have a configurable time period, which can be passed as a parameter to the
request. Pi-hole had a strange 24 hour pre-configured time window. I was not sure why it was 24
hours or why it is pre-configured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was convinced that this was going to be a deal-breaker for me. The only thing I wanted my DNS
server to report was the number of requests that it blocked and the number of requests that it
forwarded to the upstream DNS server. This value &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be wrangled out of Pi-hole and I figured
out how to do it. I had to dive deep into Pi-hole’s C code. There isn’t that much of it and I was
able to read it all over a few hours. I had to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aicyflame+is%3Aclosed&quot;&gt;2 pull requests&lt;/a&gt; to use the existing
configuration variables. These configuration variables were not respected by the application code; a
bad sign for a well-maintained codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these patches, I had managed to get the statistics that I wanted. Perhaps, I should have
stopped here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the more I thought about &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; Pi-hole was really doing, I realized that its only reason
for existence was statistics collection. Indeed, the whole repository was a large wrapper around
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound&quot;&gt;Unbound, a full-featured DNS resolver.&lt;/a&gt; All Pi-hole did was maintain a few counters which it
incremented based on the requests that it received/blocked. The statistics that it collected were
supposed to be displayed on a GUI dashboard. This dashboard is the reason for the mysterious “24
hour” value above. The code for these counters was not stellar either: There were many global
variables and there seemed to be very little of the neat dependency injection that I am used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;did not&lt;/strong&gt; like this design. A blocklist-enabled DNS server should do one thing and one thing
well&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: Serve DNS requests and block the ones that the user does not want to serve. To plaster a
GUI onto this server and change the code inside to fit it to the needs of the GUI is a bad idea, in
my opinion. If users want a GUI, then they should use the statistics that are reported by the DNS
server and make their own GUI. At the very least, the GUI should be an optional part of the DNS
server and no code or decisions made inside the DNS server should be to please the GUI user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pi-hole did not follow any of these principles. Most of the code inside the repository was primarily
to make the GUI better looking. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL/pull/1312&quot;&gt;One of the patches&lt;/a&gt; I made ended up creating a bug for most users of
the Pi-hole GUI because it changed the way that time slots were stored. Instead of storing
statistics for the “24 hours until now” when the server starts, I proposed storing the “24 hours
from the start of the server.” My approach would make sense if the server had to store the
statistics only to report it to the user as a number. If the statistics are part of a GUI, then when
the server starts, the user will see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/issues/4459&quot;&gt;a jarring empty graph&lt;/a&gt; with the current time on the left side of
the horizontal axis, with the future 24 hours with no data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/found-database-entries-in-the-future/55333&quot;&gt;This bug&lt;/a&gt; which my innocent PR to improve statistics reporting had caused put me over the top. I
decided to change my DNS software because I could not live with this C code which was not designed
in a way that I approved of and had a lot of code to satisfy GUI users, when I knew for a fact that
I was never going to use the GUI bundled with a DNS server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coredns&quot;&gt;CoreDNS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coredns.io/explugins/&quot;&gt;CoreDNS&lt;/a&gt; is a DNS server written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.dev/&quot;&gt;Golang&lt;/a&gt;. It is not a recursive DNS resolver. Indeed, it does not
do anything related to the recursive process required to resole DNS queries. However, it does
everything that is essential before and after this core part of the DNS resolution process. &lt;strong&gt;Most
importantly,&lt;/strong&gt; CoreDNS is built with plugins in mind; it provides first-class support for preexisting
plugins as well as plugins written by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another advantage to keep in mind is that CoreDNS has excellent built-in support for metrics
collection. It is designed to be run inside environments like Kubernetes, where metrics collection
is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; an afterthought. Specifically, CoreDNS integrates with the popular monitoring server
Prometheus. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://coredns.io/manual/plugins/#writing-plugins&quot;&gt;plugin API&lt;/a&gt; is intuitive. Every DNS request passes through a series of plugins. By controlling
the order in which these plugins operate, it is possible to change the input or the output of these
DNS requests. And any plugin can return a response to the user. All the heavy-lifting required to
keep track of plugins, integrate with each plugin and call them at the appropriate time, identify
whether the plugin is going to respond or simply fall through to the next plugin is done by
CoreDNS. Plugin writers have to care about a single function: This function receives a DNS request
as input, and the plugin writer’s responsibility is to either set a response to this request or to
return an error code indicating that the request should not be passed to the next plugin in the
plugin chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another (incidental) advantage is that I have been using Golang at work for the past 4 years. My
familiarity with the programming language is quite high and I was happy to write and maintain a
CoreDNS plugin. I hoped to learn more about the nitty-grity of DNS implementations, and common
pitfalls that one might fall into along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, over 2 days, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/blocker&quot;&gt;CoreDNS plugin&lt;/a&gt; to block domains based on a file and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/pihole-on-raspberrypi/compare/13ed35e71d9cd6159a148fea164f45ec70878995...851cf76e0c413180e866c8ad6f20f193ede7ab68&quot;&gt;Ansible configuration&lt;/a&gt;
to deploy this plugin alongwith the main CoreDNS application to my Raspberry Pi. The process of
writing the plugin was good. I started with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coredns/example&quot;&gt;coredns/example&lt;/a&gt; plugin provided by CoreDNS’
authors. This plugin shows other plugin writers what to think about and how to architect their
plugin. After a few hours of understanding how plugins really worked, I was able to get a working
prototype with a hardcoded list of domains. Switching out the hardcoded source of domains with a
file on the local file store was easy. The most confusing part of the process was understanding
where the order of plugin execution was defined. I understood this process after reading the
excellent blog post from CoreDNS’ authors: &lt;a href=&quot;https://coredns.io/2017/06/08/how-queries-are-processed-in-coredns/&quot;&gt;How Queries are Processed in CoreDNS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-options&quot;&gt;Other Options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS&quot;&gt;AdGuardDNS&lt;/a&gt; is the closest alternative to what I built. The DNS server is a fork of CoreDNS and it
uses a bunch of plugins built and maintained by AdGuard. I don’t have a good reason for not using
this. One of my friends uses this on their Raspberry Pi and they recommended it to me. I looked into
it and decided not to use it mostly on a whim: &lt;a href=&quot;https://adguard-dns.io/en/welcome.html&quot;&gt;AdGuard&lt;/a&gt; is a business that sells an AdBlocker and VPN
software.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The DNS server is a part of their offerings. While the DNS server is open source
right now, there is some discussion about how future features might not be added to their open
source offering, prioritizing the paid alternative instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We use AdGuard DNS functionality as a part of other AdGuard software, most of which are distributed
on a pay-to-use basis. We might also develop a paid version of AdGuard DNS based on the current one,
more advanced and with more features.
– &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS#why-is-adguard-dns-free-whats-the-catch&quot;&gt;AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS’ README. Section: “Why is AdGuard DNS free? What’s the catch?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/execjosh/mydns&quot;&gt;My coworker @execjosh’s mydns&lt;/a&gt; is another blocklist-enabled DNS server. It has a lot of logic which
was not a part of my CoreDNS plugin because all the request handling was outsourced to DNS. I used
mydns as a reference for implementing the tricky parts of DNS: Setting the reply and understanding
more about DNS question types/classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;improved-metrics-collection&quot;&gt;Improved Metrics Collection&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, did my monitoring problem get solved? Yes. &lt;em&gt;Bonus:&lt;/em&gt; I did not have to write any code to solve
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CoreDNS comes with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://coredns.io/plugins/metrics/&quot;&gt;metrics&lt;/a&gt; plugin. This plugin reports metrics in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/&quot;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; format. Having
worked with Prometheus servers inside Kubernetes for the past few years, I am familiar with this
format and I marvel at its simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the number of blocked and forwarded requests from a Prometheus-compliant metrics endpoint is
&lt;em&gt;very very simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plugin=&lt;/code&gt; part of this output, I can see that 5191 DNS requests were blocked by the
server. 218,955 DNS requests were forwarded to the upstream DNS server (an Unbound instance running
on the same Raspberry Pi.) Forwarded requests faced some errors like “Non-Existent Domain”
(&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NXDOMAIN&lt;/code&gt;) or “Server Failure” (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SERVFAIL&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to run Prometheus on the Raspberry Pi, I would be able to collect these metrics easily and
use Grafana to visualize them. However, I don’t think that I will be doing that. The Raspberry Pi
uses flash memory and is severely limited in terms of disk read/write throughput. The DNS server
itself will rarely read from disk; it needs to read the blocklist file from disk periodically. I am
interested in only one metric from the CoreDNS server, so I believe that I will continue to use an
external monitoring tool such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.mackerel.io/&quot;&gt;Mackerel&lt;/a&gt; or a local &lt;a href=&quot;https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/tut/rrdtutorial.en.html&quot;&gt;Round Robin Database&lt;/a&gt;, which is more typical for
networking infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Notes and Review - A Burning (Majumdar)</title>
   <link href="/2022/05/29/book-review-majumdar-burning"/>
   <updated>2022-05-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/05/29/book-review-majumdar-burning</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A Burning is ostensibly about 3 people. Their lives are entwined in rather banal ways: teacher, a
former student, a young woman helping a slum dweller learn English, a transgender beggar who is
learning acting, an acting teacher who has never had a real audience. Their hopes and dreams are
conventional: The young woman gets into a good school and manages to escape her past and moves
solidly into the middle class. The slum dweller hopes to learn acting and make it big in the movie
industry. Under this shroud of normalcy, and sometimes using it as a tool, Majumdar captures the
depressing nature of the life they lead. And these characters stand-in for a whole group of people;
the group that has missed the social mobility bus; the bus was packed in the 1970s with first-time
engineers and doctors and lies overturned on the side of the highway today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived for 5 years in West Bengal during college. The college was situated inside an insulated
cocoon where the outside world rarely interfered. Every time I went to Kolkata, I had to go through
Howrah Station. This railway station has been around since colonial times and it has remained mostly
unchanged during that time. The abject poverty that is prevalent in the state and the stark income
inequalities which are prevalent across India crystallized into a solid object which I had to
wrestle with, every time I went through the railway station on my way to a waiting Uber
driver. Majumdar has captured all of this terribly well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the astute observations about poverty as a way of life, and the irrational character of
social mobility, this novel is surprisingly dispassionate. The chapters titled “Interlude” are
testament to this feature: The stories inside these chapters are the most touching renderings of
poverty I have ever read. In particular, the story in which 2 young men are demanded to pay an
exorbitant entry fee to enter a mall, a fee that seemingly does not apply to plump women who look
rich, has remained in my mind ever since I read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So Raju and I stepped away from the entrance. We looked at each other. Neither of us wanted to say
it. So Raju clapped my back and I smacked his shoulder, and we went to the syrup-ice stall and had
some orange syrup-ice. Then we went back to work. Him to his house painting, that paint-smelling
turban on his head again. Me to my electrician’s shop. It was giving me pain in my wrist, pain in my
thumb. At least the syrup-ice was delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is the shadow of discrimination that inequality inevitably creates. While many of my
middle-class and upper-middle-class acquaintances strongly believe that India has come a long way
from the days of unemployment and poverty in the late 20th century, the improvements have been
captured by a few segments. There has been limited society-wide improvement in the decades since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three characters have an arc of social mobility. This arc is defined by the sacrifice that they
have to make. In the case of the soon-to-be politician, it is the witnessing of a mob lynching,
fueled &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; by communal hatred. In the case of the soon-to-be actor, it is the abandonment of a
benefactor and friend. The main character sacrifices her life to “answer” the demands of the public,
that blame be placed upon &lt;em&gt;someone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[In the courtroom, the judge announced his ruling,] “And, on the other hand, we have the word of a
hijra&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, an individual who begs on the streets for money, saying the defendant taught her
English. Be that as it may”–the judge takes a deep breath, … –“it is clear that the defendant
has long been disloyal to the values of this nation. The defendant has spoken clearly against the
government, against the police, on the Internet, on Facebook dot-com. This lack of loyalty is not
something to be taken lightly. It is its own strong piece of evidence. There is a case to be made,
as well, for soothing the conscience of the city, of the country. The people demand justice.” He
goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sacrifices are irrational. Towards the end of the book, that last sacrifice made by the
protagonist enraged me. How can one person be sacrificed at the altar to pacify the demands of a
nation for justice? Yet, what right do I have to be enraged? The first decade of the 21st century in
India was ridden with terrorist attacks across the country. After each attack, security was
increased and people (sometimes, communities) were sacrificed. The nature of these sacrifices is the
same and if I am enraged by the fictional one, then I &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; battle with the injustice inherent in
the non-fictional ones too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final notable feature of the novel is that the main incident in the novel, the burning of the
train, takes up so little of the story. It is described. And the main character’s feelings about it
and where she was in relation to the attack are also described. But we never get to see the damage
that it has done. Our perspective is forcefully limited to the daily lives of the 3 main
characters. Unfortunately, it includes such useless sources such as the nightly shows that PT Sir
watches on his TV or what Lovely’s friends tell her about their opinions. In this, I think that the
author has pointed towards the horrifying nature of life in a world of information abundance: &lt;strong&gt;What
has happened &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be important. What others are saying about it is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; more important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As tragedies engulf countries around the world in the form of inflation, food insecurity, heat
waves, and war, there is a sense that this is business-as-usual. Today’s tragedy is the latest of a
series of vignettes; certain to fade away when the next one appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; One nice part of the novel that I appreciated was that one of the characters who is in the
process of learning English, speaks in broken English throughout: (even in her inner monologues)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even a dog which is looking like a wolf is enjoying the ride in AC comfort. All of them are ignoring
me. The public is wanting blood. The media is wanting death. All around me, that is what people are
saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This character, Lovely, is learning English and she makes the kind of mistakes that are
characteristic of a beginner in India, prominently, the usage of the continuous tense everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gaslit on Twitter</title>
   <link href="/2022/05/16/gaslit-on-twitter"/>
   <updated>2022-05-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/05/16/gaslit-on-twitter</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gaslighting is a catch-all term. I understand it as the act of relentlessly bombarding a consumer of
information with a large amount of irrelevant statistics and facts to such an extent that the victim
can no longer convincingly explain (even to themselves) their fundamental beliefs. There is a lot of
talk of “gaslighting” in media environments where there is a single source of news. In India,
nightly news shows are a great example. It is also relevant in environments where a news source is
seen as biased. The biased news source’ reporting is criticized using a bunch of unrelated facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 28th and 29th of March 2022, there was a 2-day strike call in India. This news was reported
by the New York Times, and crucially, it was included in the “Daily Briefing” newsletter’s Asia
edition on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/briefing/biden-russia-oscars-will-smith-israel.html&quot;&gt;28th March, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I had not heard about the strike. (Not surprising, as I don’t
live in India and have been more out of the loop than usual lately.) None of the people I know in
India mentioned it to me over the previous weekend. When I read about the strike, I did &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; think
that NYT was reporting a lie. I accepted it as fact and went to a few Indian news websites to read
more about the strike. Quickly, I started questioning what was going on and why real people (not
“trolls”) were saying absurd things online. I am not the first person to go through this
disorienting experience and I won’t be the last. I want to talk about why I felt disoriented, how I
battled with this feeling, and how I managed to resolve my disorientation by doing some research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;part-1-is-it-true&quot;&gt;Part 1: Is It True?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is nothing quite so humiliating and disempowering as trying to prove the truth.
– &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/nknYtlOvaQ0?t=348&quot;&gt;Masha Gessen on “Why obvious lies make great propaganda”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started scrounging around the websites of some well-known Indian news websites. I checked the
website homepages for NDTV and Times of India. These two did not have any mention of the strike on
the homepage. A 2-day strike call across all of India is a &lt;strong&gt;big deal.&lt;/strong&gt; It can potentially shut
down the economy completely and significantly affect people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;For e.g.&lt;/strong&gt; Banking and public transport unions had called for a strike. This could have affected
anyone who was planning to take a bus to the train station on one of those two days or was planning
to withdraw cash from a bank for a crucial purpose such as the purchase of a home or jewelry.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; newsworthy. &lt;em&gt;Even&lt;/em&gt; if these news organizations had information which suggested that
the strike’s effects would be limited, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is front page news. Not being able to find the word
“strike” on the NDTV homepage is confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of searching around for the terms using a search engine, and specifically the
query &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;site:ndtv.com india strike&lt;/code&gt;, I saw that the strike was very much real and happening across
India. It was being covered by both the news organization whose home page I had checked; However,
the links to these specific pages were not included on the homepage. So, the only way to reach these
pages was from an external search engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had confirmed that the strike was indeed happening. To find out more about its immediate effects,
I went to Twitter. I was hoping to find some people who were as stunned as me by the (ostensibly
deliberate) under-reporting of this story. At the very least, I wanted to find some users
complaining about or reporting some of the disruptions caused by the strike. I &lt;strong&gt;did not&lt;/strong&gt; find that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;part-2-heres-the-thing-about-twitter&quot;&gt;Part 2: Here’s The Thing About Twitter&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is not very relevant when it comes to learning about what Indians are thinking.  Looking at
just the raw numbers, it becomes apparent that a very small percentage of the total population is on
Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Statistic&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Count&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Percentage of Population&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;India’s population&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.40 billion&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;100%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Number of people on the Internet in India&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;624 million&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;44.5%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Number of people on Twitter&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;34 million&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2.43%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.43% need not necessarily be unrepresentative. But clearly, the exclusion of nearly half the
population that does not have access to the internet makes the sample of users on Twitter an
unrepresentative sample of the population.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some other biases when it comes to the segment of the population that is on
Twitter. Namely, they are almost certainly literate and at least partially proficient in
English. (This last assumption might not hold true for much longer, as Twitter seems to be branching
out into regional languages.) These add up to a good assumption that most people on Twitter are not
using public transport daily (either because they can afford taxis, have private transport, or do
not need to go anywhere on a daily basis because they are working-from-home) and that they probably
never go to brick-and-mortar bank branches, doing most of their banking online. So, their opinions
about a strike which would affect these two segments of daily life are of little value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I went to Twitter because this is also the only platform where open discussion is
possible, except for group chats that one is a part of. These group chats are generally echo
chambers and seldom contain opinions that I forcefully disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, I did not find reaffirmations of my belief that this story was being
under-reported. Quite the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became clear soon enough that a New York Times tweet, one that mentioned the article about the
strike in India, had become a flashpoint for all strike-related conversation on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A two-day nationwide strike in India, involving both public and private sector workers, has
disrupted transport and other services across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Workers are protesting the government’s economic policies, including a privatization plan.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/world/asia/india-modi-general-strike.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes&quot;&gt;General Strike Throws India Into Confusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1508414880579211277&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (March 28, 2022)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this tweet, there was much derision targeted at the NYT.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Really ! When did this happen in my country ? Guys stop googling to write news , be on ground to
write news.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some attempts at humor. But the meat of the derision clarified the biases of the
population that is on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cars on the roads? There can not possibly be a strike of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Take a look at Kolkata today buddy. Wipe your eyes once again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--quoteend--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Traffic in Kalyan&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offices and shops open? There can not possibly be a strike of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Business as usual, shops are open, so are offices. Roads are jam-packed with vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Where is this so called bandh?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why was I wading through all this? To find some mention of whether public transport and banking
services were open, as the strike was targeting only those. One user reported that buses in Mumbai
were on the road and plying as usual. This is the kind of useful discussion starter that I was
expecting on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where is the strike ? My kids went to school and are back . Even my maid came to work by BEST&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the tweets were just derisive towards the NYT; some mentioned articles about media biases
against Asian and other lower-income countries; or about how the NYT did not have a reporting team
in India and did not know what was going on on-the-ground. No one was engaged in any kind of &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;
fact-finding about the strike and whether it was affecting &lt;em&gt;someone else.&lt;/em&gt; Indeed, the
self-centered-ness of some of these users is quite shocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;part-3-what-happened&quot;&gt;Part 3: What Happened?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting from the strike clarifies its impact. Here’s a catalog of the impacts with the relevant
sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banking services were affected nationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“As per our reports, in the Southern Grid functioning in Chennai, during our strike yesterday and
today, about 6 lakh cheques/instruments worth about INR 5,000 crore could not be sent for clearance as
branches did not function due to the strike,” All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) general
secretary CH Venkatachalam said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At the national level, about 20 lakh cheques worth about INR 18,000 crore could not be cleared, he
claimed&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The informal sector and small-scale industries were not impacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said the strike called by a joint forum of
trade unions has been a “total flop” in the informal sector.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In a statement, it also claimed there was no impact visible even in various industrial areas where
small industries are having manufacturing activities&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerala, a Southern state in India, seems to have been worst affected. This is not surprising;
decades of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)#Kerala_2&quot;&gt;CPI(M)&lt;/a&gt; rule in Kerala have created strong trade unions in the state. The same is true in
West Bengal, where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Front_(West_Bengal)&quot;&gt;Left Front&lt;/a&gt; was in power for 35 consecutive years between 1977
and 2011. (There is a common joke about West Bengal and strikes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;State-run KSRTC buses did not operate while taxis, auto-rickshaws and private buses kept away from
the roads across the state. Commercial vehicles including trucks and lorries are also not running
expressing solidarity with the strike.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, the essential services including milk, newspapers, hospitals, ambulances were not
affected.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participation seems to have been significantly lower than the expected 200 million formal and
informal workers that the unions were expecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amarjeet Kaur, All Indian Trade Union Congress General Secretary, told PTI that they are expecting
participation of over 20 crore formal and informal workers with mass mobilisation of workers across
the country.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what happened:&lt;/strong&gt; A bunch of trade unions issued a strike notice to nearly 200 million workers
across India. This notice was reported upon by various news organizations within and outside
India. This reporting did not have any unusual bias in favor or against India. The strike notice was
not as effective as the unions initially expected. The strike’s impact was felt by a segment of the
population, especially those in the states where unions are strong and the history of strikes is
long. However, the people online who were sharing their opinion and experiences on Twitter were
mostly unaffected by the strike. This lead to a belief that there was no strike and that reporting
was reflecting the foreign media’s anti-India bias. These people did not take any effort to confirm
whether the anecdotal evidence they had at hand was representative of other population
segments. Once people started railing on NYT, Twitter became an echo chamber where no other opinion
could break through. Once this pattern took hold, the story was no longer “Strike notice not as
effective as unions initially predicted.” It became: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-in/video/watch/nyt-misleads-readers-about-india-strike-article-s-title-blows-the-strike-out-of-proportion/vi-AAVDoz3&quot;&gt;“NYT blows strike in India out of proportion.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>"Absurd Customer Service" - Part 2, Suggestions</title>
   <link href="/2022/05/01/absurd-customer-service-part-2"/>
   <updated>2022-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/05/01/absurd-customer-service-part-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am not one to balk when it comes to writing rants and leaving it at that. However, when publishing
rants, I think it is worthwhile to also think about the problems and try to figure out whether there
is some solution to the problems that one is ranting about. Often, there is no such solution. If an
easy solution did exist, there would be no need to find catharsis through the process of writing a
rant. In the case of the Absurd Customer Service problem though, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some solutions. Some of
these are practical and can be adopted in our daily lives. While others are absurd; for the
absurdity of the solution must mirror the absurdity of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is the second post in a 2-part series about absurd customer service experiences. You can read
&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/04/30/absurd-customer-service-part-1&quot;&gt;the first part here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;customer-service-agents-are-people-empower-them-to-make-decisions&quot;&gt;Customer Service Agents Are People. Empower Them To Make Decisions.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of good service, I will cite Amazon. Okay, I know. Amazon is an example of how
capitalism has gone terribly wrong because their treatment of warehouse workers is questionable and
they are openly opposed to unions. But I will cite Amazon’s Customer Service anyway because there is
an important aspect of customer service which has been bulldozed by technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you contact Amazon’s customer care and explain your situation to the person on the other end of
the phone line or the chat message, they are &lt;em&gt;listening.&lt;/em&gt; This basic act of empathy and attention is
rare, with customer service being staffed by poorly paid, unmotivated agents who are not being paid
enough to care and are being forced to work inhumane hours. After listening to the situation that
you have gotten yourself in, the customer service agent is able to &lt;em&gt;make decisions.&lt;/em&gt; They &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;
decide to issue a refund for your order. They can contact the seller and ask them to replace what
you ordered. Their resolution depends on your situation, but all of this stems from the fact that
they trust your version of events and the customer service experience is biased to be good for the
customer and biased against the seller. (Sellers will definitely complain about this bias. If I were
to become an Amazon seller, I would probably cite Amazon as an example of bad customer service.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This organization-level trust in the customer service agent is crucial. If you don’t trust and
empower the people in the trenches to make decisions, you will frustrate the customer. As an
organization, you have the power to strong-arm shady suppliers. The customer does not have this
power. Customer retention can not be the reason you choose to have great customer service. Amazon
does not provide good customer service because they are afraid of their customers going away. (You
are going to a go to a store to buy a USB charging cable? &lt;strong&gt;What, are you crazy or something?&lt;/strong&gt;) This
move to provide good customer service must be driven by a profound desire to offer good service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;customer-service-via-email&quot;&gt;Customer Service Via Email&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most companies have moved away from the helpline number which can be called to talk to someone. This
is okay. This is not the problem. If you have a customer support email with a median
turn-around-time of 2 hours, it does not even matter whether you have a helpline number or
not. Everyone wants to explain their situation to someone and be &lt;em&gt;heard.&lt;/em&gt; If you give them a single
email address and respond reliably to your customer’s queries, they will still remain overwhelmingly
happy with your service. Do not rule out the phone: What can be explained in a 10 minute phone call
can take up 100s of lines of text. &lt;strong&gt;Nevertheless, moving away from the phone is okay. Moving away
from providing useful service is not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies have also taken to using chat bots. I think this is a bad move. Chat bots and chat
with customer service agents gives the illusion of real time communication. But most people reaching
out to customer service are probably not in standard situations which can be listed up and supplied
as input to a chat bot software, or can be &lt;strong&gt;resolved quickly&lt;/strong&gt; by an agent. It will probably take
time to understand the situation, make a decision, get approvals for the decision, and communicate
it to the user. All of this can &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be completed in a 5-minute chat session in which you can not
move away from your screen. And hopefully, you won’t close the tab that has the open chat with
customer support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;stay-away-from-the-absurd-stay-away-from-the-shiny-new-thing&quot;&gt;Stay Away From The Absurd. Stay Away From The Shiny New Thing.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, old-school capitalists were known for their conservative beliefs and their deep
suspicion of the “new thing on the block.” Now, the equation is reversed. Capitalists want to employ
the shiny new thing, as soon as it comes out. Everyone abandoned e-mail for Slack and helplines for
SalesForce. Where are we now? 100s of unread threads on Slack every Monday morning and customer
service inquiries which never get answered despite having a “reference number” automatically
generated by your ticketing software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a semi-popular adage about technology: &lt;strong&gt;When any new technology comes out, don’t be an
early adopter of it and don’t be the last person to adopt it either.&lt;/strong&gt; You have to choose your time
and start using the technology somewhere in the middle; at a point when it has gotten sufficient
traction to be well-understood and sufficient time to mature into a cost-effective product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until a few months ago, I believed that this kind of cost-benefit analysis was built into our
economy. After all, decision makers demand huge amounts of data, analysis, and well-built
presentations before deciding to delve into something. &lt;strong&gt;Why, then, do we end up with bad systems?&lt;/strong&gt; I
have come to the conclusion that when it comes to the shiny new thing, the new thing is so shiny
that many decision makers will look past the blemishes just under the shiny surface and claim to see
the &lt;strong&gt;vision&lt;/strong&gt; at the core of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has reached cult-like levels with crypto-currency and decentralization:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency and Web 3 are the shiny new things. Yes, they have some problems right now. But hey!
It’s early days. We are heading towards a glorious decentralized future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;re-your-mobile-number-dont-ask-dont-tell&quot;&gt;Re: Your Mobile Number. Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this is the hard one. For customers, don’t share your mobile number with the shops that you
shop at. Why would you share your mobile number with a random cashier when you would think long and
hard before sharing it with a potential mate? What is the value addition for you? Why do you want to
give this information to a shop? How do you know the shop is not selling the database that it has
built up of names and phone numbers to some sales agency? Our mobile numbers are the &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; direct
ways to reach us; there is no filter. Do Not Disturb services offered by operators are famously
bad. I think that we would love being in a world in which every email and every phone call we get is
actually something that we are interested in. With email, we have methods to filter out the ones
that we don’t want. Unfortunately, these mechanisms do not exist for mobile phones right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of mobile telephony also makes it very hard to switch your phone easily. You would almost
certainly have to spend several hours changing your phone number at the places that matter to you
(banks, security services, online 2-Factor Authentication). We want to avoid doing this as much as
possible. And the simplest way to do this is to simply not share your number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possible method that I have heard of is to have some sort of a throwaway number which you
can use everywhere that you don’t want to give your main phone number. But I think this is more
cumbersome and fiscally wasteful. Now, you have two phone numbers to keep track of and there is no
way to know when you will need which number. So, you have to carry both numbers along all the
time. That is suboptimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that organizations and businesses want to track their customers. They want to find out
who is a loyal customer and give them deals or maybe they want to entice them to come back by
sending them a message perilously close to their birthday or Valentine’s Day. In these cases, they
&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need some method of tracking customers and their purchases. But I think that this can be based
on the points-based reward system. A basic point system would award you points based on your
purchase, which can be kept track of preferably using some sort of paper card. You get extra points
for your birthday, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system works very well. I can say this from my experience in Japan. Perhaps due to restrictions
on the storage and sharing of personal information, most shops in Japan will ask you if you want a
point card whenever you purchase something there. If you say no, they leave you be. (They will ask
you the next time you shop there.) If you say yes, they will give you a small piece of paper or a
coupon which can be used on your next purchase there. This is surprisingly effective. I have point
cards from some of the chains that I use regularly for furniture, electronics, coffee beans. And I
specifically look for these shops when I have to make some kind of purchase. This is the perfect
situation for a customer; they are able to enjoy the benefits of being loyal to a chain of stores
without divulging any personal information to the chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;technology-is-not-a-silver-bullet&quot;&gt;Technology Is Not A Silver Bullet&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think everyone needs to repeat this to themselves at least once a day. That is not hyperbole; it
is a real suggestion for people who are making decisions about the adoption of new tools. Most
cities in India have watchmen standing at the gates of apartment buildings. This has been a fixture
of apartment buildings of all sizes since the early 2000s. In this landscape, there is hardly any
security threat which the watchmen can’t identify or act on. Yet, a business such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyGate&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; is
able to thrive. Why is that? Why should someone who has come to your apartment building to deliver a
package to &lt;em&gt;your house&lt;/em&gt; have to be approved on a mobile application before they can deliver the
package that is &lt;strong&gt;addressed to you?&lt;/strong&gt; This redundant verification is futile. It assumes that the
watchman who is standing at the gate will not be able to make a judgment about whether the person
and the package are legitimate. It is interesting to note that most buildings which introduce this
application do not actually cut costs by getting rid of the watchmen who are guarding the building
at the gate. &lt;strong&gt;This kind of application is introduced simply because &lt;em&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt; is the solution. No
one has noticed that there is a problem yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no simple way to convince people that the introduction of new technology is always a bad
idea when it does not solve an existing problem. There are some people who want to venture out into
the unpaved land and explore new ideas. I certainly do not want to &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; new technology simply
because it exists. It is a waste of my time. And it is a waste of yours too. So, before you adopt
the latest technology in customer service, ask yourself if you are solving a problem with it or
whether you are indulging your desire to be known as a cutting edge organization. *No matter what
technologies you introduce, the core requirement for good customer service will always be empathy;
not a computer screen or a case reference.*&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>"Absurd Customer Service" - Part 1, The Problem</title>
   <link href="/2022/04/30/absurd-customer-service-part-1"/>
   <updated>2022-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/04/30/absurd-customer-service-part-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over a series of several occasions last year, I experienced the absurdity rife in modern customer
service. I don’t think that things have always been like this. Customer service was a pain and you
would often by stuck on 30 minute phone calls trying to explain your situation to the other
person. But there &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; a person at the other end. And after those grueling 30 minutes, they &lt;strong&gt;would&lt;/strong&gt;
understand your situation and do something to rescue you from it. My experiences did not conform to
this pattern. It looks like this problem is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/phone-scam-phishing-finance-apps/&quot;&gt;widespread enough&lt;/a&gt; to warrant feature articles in
magazines.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Indeed, in all the cases that I encountered, the problem was eventually resolved in a
miraculous and bizarre fashion; with my interventions seemingly making no impact on the course of
things. My experiences were with multiple businesses and in different industries: telecom, banking,
and retail. But I think that there are some common trends which can be pinpointed. These trends have
made the experience of “reaching out to customer support” in India a painful and exasperating
experience. In this, the first of a 2 part series, I briefly recount my experiences. Hopefully, the
reader has not been through similar experiences and can read them simply as an amusing recounting of
events that will never happen to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;telecom&quot;&gt;Telecom&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience with the Telecom industry, I wanted to switch plans for a mobile phone connection
from Postpaid to Prepaid. This is a routine process and any business worth their salt will be
careful to establish a well-defined process which can be followed by all the people working at its
brick-and-mortar stores. The business in question was Airtel. Airtel is one of the largest players
in the telecom business in India and they have been around for a while. So, I did not expect any
issues at all. But despite multiple visits to a physical store, the process was simply not getting
done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clerks at the store had no clue about what was going on. They were sitting in front of a
computer screen and reading out the errors that were being shown to them on the screen. Indeed,
their presence was merely aesthetic as they seemed to add neither warmth nor value to the
communication I was having with the computer. All of this went up a notch when, in a burst of
frustration, I called Airtel’s customer service line 121.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The menu of options is confusing, beyond belief. The main purpose of this menu seems to be to drive
the user away from the phone to the app store and to get them to install the “Airtel Thanks” mobile
application&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Ironically, the reason I was calling the customer service line was because I had
already lodged a complaint through the mobile application. However, this complaint seems to have
disappeared into the vast ether of the universe because I could not get it in the list of complaints
on the &lt;strong&gt;same&lt;/strong&gt; app. I did not receive any other communication about this complaint either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the phone, after having listened to endless automated voice guidance read out in a sooth voice
that is not at all representative of the listener’s frustration and after delving through some of
the options and repeated ventures down the incorrect road, I figured out how to get to a human. The
customer service line is not staffed with many people. So, often, there are long waits before you
get connected to a human being. This wait generally lasts a few minutes, minutes that one can
productively use to contemplate the futility of their efforts in a universe that has been around for
billions of years and will continue unchanged for billions more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of this wait, I was connected to a person whose official designation &lt;em&gt;I believe&lt;/em&gt; was
“Customer Service Executive Extraordinaire Emeritus.”  In typical corporate jargon fashion, this
title is meaningless and serves only to divert you from the exceptionally bad service you will soon
receive. After explaining what I wanted to achieve to the person on the other end of the line, she
told me straight away that there was nothing she could do. The only people who could help were the
people at the physical stores. So, her counsel was to simply return to the store.  &lt;em&gt;Somehow&lt;/em&gt; this
conversation would affect the scheme of things and when I next return to the store, the people there
would be able to achieve what on 3 prior excursions they had failed miserably at. I wondered if this
customer service agent is a believer in a religious sect where doing the same thing over and over
again and expecting a different result is the central tenet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing as she could not help with my original goal, I figured that I might as well lodge a complaint
about the store where the clerks seemed to be uninformed about the process and uninterested to check
the operation manual, which I am sure they … Well, Airtel &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; did not issue them with a
operation manual. My naive belief was that Airtel would want to know about the bad experiences
their customers were having. What happened right after this convinced me that they did not have any
such desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her that I would like to file a complaint about an Airtel store. She asked me for the
address. I told her the address. She was unable to find it. I spelled it out. She was still unable
to find it. I sent her a pigeon that had a note tied to its legs with the secret code that she
needed to enter into her computer to find the store. I guess the pigeon reached her because she
&lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; then able to find it. Alas, this was useless. I am not exaggerating here. It was &lt;strong&gt;literally&lt;/strong&gt;
completely useless that she had been able to find the store. To prove my point, here’s the
conversation that followed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, I would like to lodge a complaint about that store.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer Service Representative:&lt;/strong&gt; I see. You will have to visit the store to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; Um … really?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSR:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, that doesn’t make sense. Can you put in a note for someone to check with the store manager
and see why the clerks there don’t know the procedure and whether they can learn the new procedure?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSR:&lt;/strong&gt; We can’t contact the store directly&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; WHAT?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSR:&lt;/strong&gt; We are unable to contact the store directly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you mean?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSR:&lt;/strong&gt; We are unable to contact the store directly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;… the conversation continued in this vein for a few more lines. Then,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSR:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, if you want us to talk to the store manager, then there is an option.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, what is it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSR:&lt;/strong&gt; You can go to the store, call 121 from &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; phone, and connect to a customer service
representative. When you are connected, you can ask someone at the store to talk directly with us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; Um, okay. Thank you. &lt;em&gt;(I guess?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that’s what happened. In summary, Airtel is a telecommunications business which provides mobile
connectivity to hundreds of millions of people. It has stores across the vast landscape of
India. These stores have managers and others working there. Airtel has no way of contacting the
stores directly. Indeed, there seems to be little or no contact between Airtel and the store, except
through the computers that are sitting in front of every single person at the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all this, all I could do was laugh at the absurdity of what I had experienced. I felt much
like what I imagine Kierkegaard must have felt like when &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/D9JCwkx558o&quot;&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I grew up I opened my eyes and saw the real world and I began to laugh and I have not stopped
since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; We were able to switch the mobile number from Postpaid to Prepaid by visiting a different
store and following a procedure that we had heard about more than 3 years ago. The people at this
other store also had no idea about this procedure and did not inform us about it or that this was
the procedure to follow. Airtel’s consistency is worth appreciating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;banking&quot;&gt;Banking&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second experience was with the banking industry. This case was slightly more complex. When my
credit card was renewed, I was sent a new one. It was sent to my home address in India. There is no
limitation in India that the credit card &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be collected by the person whose name is printed on
the card. It can be collected by anyone at the household, as long as they are in the correct
address. As my family was still living at my home address, I believed that there would be no
problems in receiving the credit card. That was a huge mistake. &lt;strong&gt;HUGE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, this time around, the card was dispatched from the bank’s central dispatching
center. It was sent via courier, which is very common. My home address is in a city and it is very
accessible. Delivery people from most courier companies come to my neighborhood daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first delivery attempt was logged as “Door locked,” at a time that I had already confirmed
people &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; indeed present at the house, I sensed that something fishy was afoot. I wish I could
say here that I was able to foresee what the problem was and fix it instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is not uncommon for delivery people in India to fill in “Door locked” as a reason for not
delivering packages without even visiting the home where they are supposed to deliver it, it is not
common enough to be the first thing that one suspects. On further inspection of the scant details I
could get from a ghastly tracking page for this courier company (You have not heard about it.), I
realized that the contact number on the package was my mobile number; a number on which I was unable
to receive calls. My guess was that the delivery person was calling the phone number on the
package. On not being able to reach the phone number, they decided that the recipient was definitely
not at home and probably dead. So, they &lt;em&gt;understandably&lt;/em&gt; filled out “Door locked” as the reason for
not delivering the package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I tried to contact the courier company’s customer service. They had no phone line. (Their
website had been wiped of any mention of contact or phone numbers by a highly trained team of web
developers.) There was a single email ID which they apparently wished all their customers to contact
them on. An email to this address elicited a quick response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject:&lt;/strong&gt; Re: Delivery person did not come to my home (Tracking ID: [REMOVED])&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Dear Sidharth,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.We are forwarding this case to the team and assure you
of expeditious closure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Along with this, we have forwarded the request to deliver the shipment on priority and will try to
deliver it at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In addition to this, we have forwarded the alternative number([REMOVED]) to the team. Meanwhile, we
request you to contact the merchant([REMOVED]) to update the contact number.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Best Regards&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;[Name]
Customer Experience
[Courier Company]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content of this email was encouraging. It &lt;em&gt;sounded&lt;/em&gt; like someone had read my email, understood
my situation, and taken some action. This basic requirement of a “human response” was satisfied!
But, as the astute reader might have guessed, this was not to be. My credit card remained
undelivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first package was returned to sender after 3 failed attempts due to the spurious reason “Door
Locked.” The package was sent out a second time with the same courier company, and the whole dance
was repeated one more time. Realizing that my interventions were futile and could serve to only hurt
my well being, I decided to lay-off for a period of time and not say anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the package was returned to sender a second time, there were no updates. The bank had
contacted me to say that they had been unable to contact me at my address. However, what they really
meant was that they had called me and I had not picked up. Curiously, the bank did not include any
information about how &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; might contact them. Seeing as they could not reach me on my phone number,
the logical step would be to provide another means of contact. Well, logical to me. To the bank, who
knows. Maybe they believe that a person’s identity should be confirmed by &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; their ability to
answer phone calls. Perhaps they have done extensive studies and conducted multiple security audits
and concluded that while people engaging in identity theft might be able to physically impersonate
another person or enter the victim’s home and receive packages on their behalf, most identity
thieves were &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; able to answer phone calls on behalf of the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a last ditch attempt, I emailed the general customer support email address of the bank. I told
them that the delivery company they were using did not have coverage in my area and that they should
use another company. (I might as well try something new as my original story seemed to have no
traction with any Customer &lt;em&gt;Service&lt;/em&gt; Representative.) This email did not elicit a response. There
was an automated response which assigned me an incomprehensibly long “case number.” I wonder why
they bother issuing these case numbers. And I wonder why these case numbers are so long. Are they
really dealing with billions of customer service cases? Is that not a sign of dysfunction in and of itself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few days, one fine evening, I received an SMS on my contact number saying that the credit
card will be delivered to my home in 30 minutes by a different courier company. I had done nothing
to trigger this change in courier company. Indeed, about 30 minutes later, the package was
delivered. Here again, the bank’s belief in mobile telephony was reinforced! When the person arrives
at the door to deliver your package, an SMS is sent to you with a 2-Factor Authentication code. If
you are unable to provide this code to the delivery person, you are not you. Of course, it follows
that if you are able to provide this code, you &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be the intended receiver. *Why believe in
government documents that establish your ID when you have a mobile phone capable of receiving text
messages?*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;retail&quot;&gt;Retail&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final set of examples is from retail. It is a well known fact that retail jobs are the worst of
the bunch because store clerks have to often deal with adults without &lt;em&gt;emotional regulation,&lt;/em&gt; prone
to fits at the register, offloading on the poor person standing behind the register. So, my empathy
for people in these jobs is quite high. However, the capitalist machinations operate these people
have made them do some very strange things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first instance was at a cafe inside a mall. After buying something, I went to the register to
pay. There the clerk told me that they did not accept cash; that they accepted &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; credit or
debit cards. While the inverse of this is something that most people might have experienced, I had
never experienced anything like this. After a few seconds of being surprised by this strange
request, I told him that I did not have a card of any sort and that cash was all I had. At this
point, another person working at the cafe came to his side, and they conferred briefly. After this,
he said that he would be happy to accept cash and opened the register. &lt;strong&gt;What do I see inside the
register but … paper money?!?!&lt;/strong&gt; Why did the people who run this cafe start this absurd campaign to
accept anything but cash, when their register was clearly stocked and cash is recognized legal
tender across the country? I can not say; I can not even imagine a case in which this would make
sense. Maybe they &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to pay the 3% service charge that companies like Visa and MasterCard charge
for the trouble of facilitating credit cards and operating a large network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second instance of retail absurdity is really many instances of the same experience. Whenever
you buy &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; and go to pay for it, the likelihood of being asked for your mobile number is
high. I think, in current day metropolitan India, it is basically 100%. Across a wide variety of
shops selling clothes, footwear, and food, I was asked for my phone number at almost every
turn. Being rather adamant about not sharing my phone number, I have caused lines to form behind me
as I try to convince the person at the register that I don’t want another random human being to have
to call me and tell me about the availability of money that I will never borrow or insurance that I
will never buy. I explain to them how it will waste both of our times and how the activity of
entering my phone number into the computer screen wastes the cashier’s time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phone number requirement in daily life has reached absurd proportions now. On a recent trip to
a mall parking lot, the age-old parking slip had been replaced by … you guessed it … a mobile
number. Every vehicle parked inside the parking lot &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have a registration number. But once
again, &lt;strong&gt;the mobile phone seems to have superseded the vehicle’s unique registration number as an
identifier for the vehicle!&lt;/strong&gt; Absurdly enough, the phone number was collected at entry and at exit by
a person. It was not used to speed up the process or reduce the number of people who staffed the
parking lot. I tried to provide the person with an arbitrary mobile number. This worked, so long as
I remembered the mobile number when I exited the parking lot. So, the question I had after the
experience was, &lt;strong&gt;why change something which gives you neither a monetary benefit nor an improved
experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Well, perhaps, customer service absurdity has warped the minds of executives at
the top of these companies enough that they don’t even recognize that they are inside a capitalist
society anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A cursory search for this problem lead me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbevis/2019/05/16/the-decline-of-customer-service-in-america/?sh=4bb5d2a92fde&quot;&gt;this article from 2019&lt;/a&gt; that tries to persuade businesses to use technology to connect customers with humans, rather than with computers. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That is the real name of the app. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I am being frivolous here by suggesting that the collection of mobile numbers does not have monetary benefits. There are reports of companies which build up databases of names and phone numbers and sell them to cold calling firms which will use the database to sell loans / products etc. Surely, the mall earns more from the patronage of a returning customer than from selling a phone number database? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Facebook is Unnecessary</title>
   <link href="/2022/04/29/facebook-is-unnecessary"/>
   <updated>2022-04-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/04/29/facebook-is-unnecessary</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone agrees that Facebook makes them feel worse. It accelerates the “Fear Of Missing Out”
anxiety that is quite strong &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; when you don’t know &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; what your peers are doing on a
Friday evening. But people continue to flock to Facebook. Yes, Facebook is losing teen users&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,
but this is not a precipitous drop. In any case, these teenagers are going to other platforms which
are arguably worse than Facebook for reasons that I will outline in this post. What is so
interesting on Facebook? Why does it exist? What is it for?  These are incredibly complex questions.
I will leave that hardest-of-all tasks to the technology philosophers. Instead, I will focus on the
one thing that became clear to me after a recent conversation: The existence of Facebook is an
anomaly. Facebook’s target user base will never need to use Facebook: Facebook is meant to “connect
people.” Their belief is that if you know what is on your friends’ mind, then you are connected to
them. The better you know someone, the more connected you are to them. The more you will be able to
appreciate the posts they make, both personal and political. &lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt; the better you know someone, the
less you need a tool such as Facebook to keep that relationship alive and healthy. So, you don’t
need Facebook to connect with the people whom you are closest with in the world.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;So, …,
what gives?&lt;/strong&gt; Why are you on a platform where you are connecting with a bunch of people whom you know
only vaguely and care about at the superficial level? I have some thoughts about this dichotomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;types-of-posts&quot;&gt;Types of Posts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the premise that posting on Facebook is a right. Broadcasting what is happening in your
life is your choice and some people choose to exercise this right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you share what you have done or what has happened in your life, I think you can classify the
post into one of three buckets. (I know this is a simplification.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genuine Excitement:&lt;/strong&gt; Something has happened in your life that you are genuinely excited
about. Excitement is subjective and it is hard to quantitatively judge anything. Why someone is
genuinely excited about something is besides the point. If they are sharing something that they
are genuinely excited about, then the post falls in this bucket. I posted on Facebook about
getting my first internship in 2015. I was excited about that opportunity back then and I believe
that I will classify that post into this bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling of Accomplishment:&lt;/strong&gt; Something has happened in your life that you have been working
toward for a long time. You had doubts about whether you would get here, but you have finally
achieved whatever goal you were looking for. Once again, subjectivity abounds. What seems a
“matter of course” to me, could be the hardest thing for someone else. We all start from
different places and subjectivity precludes us from making any judgment about what content falls
in this bucket. But the poster &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; feel this accomplishment and should classify their post
into this bucket. I posted on Instagram after graduating from university. It was 5 years of
struggling through a program that I did not particularly like and a lot happened during that
time, and I wanted to share the accomplishment which I felt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bragging:&lt;/strong&gt; Something has happened in your life and you want to brag about it. Settle down,
this is not “Shots fired!” Showing off is just a part of how we operate. It’s not some anomaly
which needs to be tamped down on. I disagree that it is a worthwhile pursuit. But that’s my
opinion and nothing more. On Facebook, this is simply one of 3 possible buckets that you might
classify your post into. On Instagram, things get murkier. There’s not much space to say anything
because Instagram shows a small segment of your caption by default.  Most of the viewer’s screen
is taken up by the high-resolution picture that you have uploaded. &lt;strong&gt;I contend that Instagram is a
platform where most users would classify most of their posts into the “Bragging” bucket.&lt;/strong&gt; A few
years ago, I bought my first iPod and my first headphones. I posted a picture of the headphones
resting on my window sill to Instagram from the iPod. I was bragging about these things that I
had now. Looking back at my Instagram, I can see that it was a clumsy attempt at bragging about
something, but I can’t bring myself to classify the post into the other two buckets that I have
defined here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note here that I talk about classifying your own post. So, the onus is on the poster to decide what
they are doing on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;where-does-the-frequent-poster-come-from&quot;&gt;Where Does the Frequent Poster Come From?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiencing Facebook, one thing was clear to me. &lt;strong&gt;It is &lt;del&gt;fun&lt;/del&gt; addictive.&lt;/strong&gt; The number of views on a
story, likes on a post, or comments on an announcement continuously increase. The product is
designed to draw the user’s attention to these numbers. 3 years ago, I went on a trip and posted a
picture from the trip to my Instagram story. I posted rarely enough back then that this triggered a
notification to almost everyone who followed me. (The “… has posted for the first time in a long
while. Check it out now!” notification.) Within minutes, about 20 people had seen the story. This
number kept growing for the next several hours. For the 24 hours that this picture was visible, I
could barely stop myself from opening the application, tapping on the story, scrolling down, and
checking the list of people who had seen the picture. I have had similar experiences with posting a
life update on Facebook, or a comment on a hotly debated post from my friend. The anxiety and
excitement of waiting for a response and getting ready to re-engage is exquisite. It &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; similar
to the adrenaline rush that you would get when you were in a dangerous situation or right before you
are pushed down a slide in an amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My self-regulation was not good enough to prevent this kind of usage of Instagram. I was
(thankfully) vigilant enough to realize what was happening and managed to cut out Instagram
posting. A few years later, I completely got off Instagram. But most people don’t take this
approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the high from a single story becomes duller and duller, more highs are needed. And so, users
start posting more. &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is how the frequent poster is born: They start out as a standard user of
the platform; and then, the platform’s incentives and product design force them into posting more
often to get the same feeling as they got from a single post when they started using the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-about-comments-and-discussion&quot;&gt;What About Comments and Discussion?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen Facebook posts which fall into each of the three buckets above. And I have seen the
comments on those posts. More often than not, the comments section turns into a heated debate about
some obscure, tangential subject which is barely even related to the post. It seems to me that the
likelihood of this happening is proportional to the abstractness of the topic of the post. The more
concrete a post, the less people want to engage with it in the comments section. Why does the
comments section feel like a halfhearted addition? &lt;strong&gt;Because it was.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the movie Social Network shows and as early users of Facebook know, the original point of the
platform was to simply post updates about your life. The comments section feels like a tacky add-on
which is there for the minority of friends who want to say something, as opposed to the majority who
want to catch up on others’ life updates. The Facebook mobile app (even now) barely allows you to
read all the comments at once in chronological order. It will show you the latest few comments below
the post. If you want to see the first comment, you have to begin doom scrolling up to the end of
the planet. It seems obvious that the product is designed to keep people scrolling on the feed,
rather than go into a single post and check the comments on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-do-people-use-these-platforms-then&quot;&gt;Why Do People Use These Platforms Then?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posing big and profound questions like this is easy and fun. Answering them is impossible. I can
only point to some of the other things that are happening in society, just as we are starting to
notice that people of all ages and backgrounds &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; these platforms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone is in a more urban setting now, than a few decades ago. I am extremely glad about this:
It is an indication of the economic progress that middle-income countries have made. But urban
settings have long been characterized by lax barriers on individual freedoms and &lt;strong&gt;cold,
disconnected lives lead in a crowd.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are the type to long for the warmth of a rural
setting, then you might wax nostalgic about this. I have no such longings and I think that
urbanization is a &lt;em&gt;net good&lt;/em&gt; which improves our lives. Nevertheless, the disconnection of an
urban life must be balanced by the connection that one pursues on social media.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organized institutions are declining. This is a phenomenon that has been documented in
America. Rotary clubs and organized religion have lost their grip on the population. There are
few institutions where people congregate for the sake of congregation. (Developer conferences have
become caricatures of the corporate networking events which they tried desperately to not emulate
in the early days of the Internet.) Whether this phenomenon is occurring in other countries at
the same rate is an open question.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capitalistic work is inherently alienating. While earlier forms of work and toil involved
some pride in the product of the work, most forms of work in capitalism are alienated because the
mere worker never gets to see the final product or the financial gains that were achieved through
their work. This is not a bad thing: I am glad to not have to “see myself in the products I
make.” But what if this &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; a bad thing? What if the activity that a lot of adults spend most
of their time doing &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; necessarily be something that produces something they feel proud
about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;do-you-need-facebook&quot;&gt;Do You Need Facebook?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all at crossroads all the time. We make decisions about which search result to click on and
what post to like. What about the Facebook crossroad? Do you need it? I don’t think anyone &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt;
Facebook or Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indulge me by letting me state the obvious: These tools exist now and they are not going
anywhere. The whole world is not going to stop using them at the drop of a pin. These companies are
run expertly by capitalists who have built systems to ensure their survival. What does one person’s
mutiny achieve?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It achieves nothing.&lt;/strong&gt; The refusal to use Facebook or Instagram is an ideological one for me. I
think that it is superfluous to my way of life and to the connections that I wish to build with
people. If you are not affected by the bragging &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; if you are friends with people you really care
about and don’t mind receiving the same information twice (once directly from a friend and once
through Facebook) &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; you like seeing the periodic heartwarming post that the algorithm serves you
&lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; if you use it to catch up on updates from a news service or a film actor &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; etc etc etc
… then it might be a great tool for you. &lt;strong&gt;You are the target user.&lt;/strong&gt; For everyone else, &lt;strong&gt;Facebook
is unnecessary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;

   <title>Monthly Recommendations (February 2022)</title>
   <link href="/2022/02/28/2022-february"/>
   <updated>2022-02-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/02/28/2022-february</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The month of February is before the end of the financial year and the month that many governments
release their budgets for the next financial year. They also talk (at length) about the policies
that they are going to implement.  To commemorate this annual exercise in long-term decision making,
this month’s list of recommendations is about &lt;strong&gt;politics and government policy.&lt;/strong&gt; We see examples of
government policy gone wrong and those that worked out well. There is an interesting new theory
about conservatism and the feeling of disgust (not just at &lt;em&gt;liberal&lt;/em&gt; ideas, but a more &lt;em&gt;generic&lt;/em&gt;
form of disgust.) And there is an article about degrowth from Vox, which has been making the rounds
periodically since 2019. It is worth looking back on this article periodically to understand how
futile unilateral action can prove to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liberals and Conservatives React in Wildly Different Ways to Repulsive Pictures (McAuliffe)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/the-yuck-factor/580465/&quot;&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.today/2020.07.24-032124/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/the-yuck-factor/580465/&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). Mar. 2019&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Political pundits offhandedly talk about liberals, conservatives, left/right, left of center,
and so on. They keep stressing that we are all on some kind of spectrum between the extremes, and
that our feelings about each subject are different. There is &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; agreement that political
ideologies are sticky and that they are formed based on the household and the environment that
one grows up in. There are exceptions, but it seems safe to assume that &lt;em&gt;few people&lt;/em&gt; break out of
their original political ideologies to make a dramatic shift.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We like to portray ourselves as rational beings who started with a blank slate and ended up at
our current political ideology through a process of reasoning. Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prri.org/research/qanon-conspiracy-american-politics-report/&quot;&gt;conspiracy theorists&lt;/a&gt; like to
claim that their beliefs are based on evidence and facts. Jon Haidt’s theory says that the
apparently rational reasons we have for our political ideologies actually come &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; we have
decided which side to support. Based on this theory, Haidt’s view is that conservatism is “easier
to sell.”  There is a very strong temptation to believe this. Most people you know are probably
conservative on social or economic policy issues, characterized by beliefs such as “Government
spending is too high; taxes are too high; ‘culture / politeness / chivalry’ is dead because the
current generation does not value ‘relationships / seniority / …’; society is changing &lt;em&gt;too
fast&lt;/em&gt;.” Haidt’s reasoning is flawless and likely the way things are. Yet, I hold out hope that
there is nothing structurally tempting about conservatism and that there is still a way for
politicians to sell liberal ideas and have success doing it. So, I found this article about the
relationship between conservatism and the feeling of disgust to be a great avenue of research
which might help us understand if conservatism is explained by something much more fundamental
than our environment: &lt;strong&gt;The evolutionary requirement to prevent contamination.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York’s Real Estate Tax Breaks Are Now a Rich-Kid Loophole (Melby)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-nyc-taxes-hdfc-coops/&quot;&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.today/2021.10.11-135933/https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-nyc-taxes-hdfc-coops/&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). Oct. 8, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Badly done policy is hard to spot. I think the reason for this is that governments write policy
documents and they &lt;em&gt;happen to be&lt;/em&gt; the only ones with the resources to read the complete document
and come to conclusions about its effects. Think tanks have agendas and donors. Polling firms
have biases. Also, in most cases, the effect of a policy is not clear until several years after
the policy has been implemented. (There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/child-tax-credit/&quot;&gt;notable exceptions&lt;/a&gt;.) Once implemented, the government
has little incentive to improve their implementation, irrespective of who is in power. Because if
the same party is in power, then it is an admission that their original policy was not the best,
an implication that the opposition will pounce upon. And if the opposition is in power, it is an
admission that the original policy was good and simply needs to be made better. Both of these are
anathema to politicians who want to win the next election. These are the conditions that lead to
drawn out political matches, which the media covers with play-by-play coverage and politicians
use to improve their standing among their base.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As policies are hard to analyze thoroughly, they will contain loopholes which can be exploited
&lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; by large corporations, who have the resources to scour the documents for a thorough
understanding. This has lead to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXeaNZFUXgE&quot;&gt;a fetishization of “short-and-sweet” policy&lt;/a&gt; which doesn’t have as
much fine-print. But there is no implicit guarantee that a smaller bill will &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/c4dNH-Nb2Ow&quot;&gt;be devoid of
loopholes&lt;/a&gt;. This article chronicles one such policy which ended up benefiting exactly the wrong
group of people: Children of rich parents with low personal incomes. Other loopholes which have
made news in the recent past are related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/how-billionaires-pass-wealth-to-heirs-tax-free-2021/&quot;&gt;billionaires evading the estate tax&lt;/a&gt; and demonstrate
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax&quot;&gt;the lengths that the people go to to get out of paying taxes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘It’s a Godsend’: 9-Cent Taxi Rides in Rural South Korea (Sang-Hun)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/11/world/asia/south-korea-100-won-taxis.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.today/2021.09.11-111448/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/11/world/asia/south-korea-100-won-taxis.html&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). Sept. 11, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Government policy can also bring about radical changes. There are many examples to be found in
the Asian economies which caught up to the West in the few decades after the Second World War
(Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and now, China). This article about South Korea’s “car-less
population rescue policy” is a great example of how this spirit of good government policy remains
alive, despite all the opposition that it is facing from a disengaged voterbase and a
progressively shortening attention span. Public transport is outsourced to businesses that would
like to make a profit on each customer. But when there are very few customers, it becomes hard
for governments to incentivize the building and operating of public transport networks. This is
happening both Japan and Korea, where the population is rapidly aging and most of the population
is concentrated in the urban areas which grew rapidly in the 20th Century. One solution is to
make private transport more attractive for rural residents by reducing taxes. Korea has gone in a
completely different direction by providing affordable rides from remote locations to the closest
towns and bus stops.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This article also shows something very refreshing for people who are living in a bleak policy
landscape, where the government’s priorities seem to be completely out of sync with the citizens’
priorities:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When Statistics Korea conducted a nationwide survey in 2010, a lack of public transportation was
one of the biggest grievances for older villagers in rural South Korea who had neither cars nor
children who could drive for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It shows that the government listened to people and their complaints. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt;, despite being the
“way” that democracy is supposed to work traditionally, is becoming increasingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyone Seen Tether’s Billions? (Faux)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether&quot;&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.today/2022.02.09-234616/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). Oct. 7, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency is weird and it is hard to explain to laypeople and aficionados alike that
Bitcoin has become a speculative asset, with no future as a store of value, like a stable
currency. The cryptography behind cryptocurrencies is great. When the Bitcoin paper became a big
deal in the early 2010s, I read it and re-read it to understand how something that was
decentralized could hold any value. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; was a pivotal moment for the storage of value. Then,
things went south.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Stable coins are an instrument that is nearly the same as a government-backed currency, but
mints the benefits of the current “completely decentralized crypto-currency” frenzy. Tether was
one of the biggest stablecoins. This article is an investigation to find the cash that is
supposed to be backing the stablecoin. It is an interesting piece that delves into the
&lt;em&gt;non-conforming&lt;/em&gt; characters that were involved in the development of this stable coin (and more
generally across the crypto space.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we save the planet by shrinking the economy? (Piper)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22408556/save-planet-shrink-economy-degrowth&quot;&gt;Vox&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.today/2021.08.04-141251/https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22408556/save-planet-shrink-economy-degrowth&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). Aug. 3, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“Modern-day economies have grown too much and the people in them buy too many things / drive
too much / eat too much meat / throw away too many clothes / et al. So, to reduce emissions,
these people should be told to reduce their activity and return to life as it was a few years /
decades / centuries ago.” That is a short summary of the degrowth movement. Activists lobby
governments. Governments produce reports. World leaders go to annual &lt;a href=&quot;/climate-change/global/policy/governments/2021/10/30/climate-change-fever/&quot;&gt;climate conferences&lt;/a&gt;. Claims
are made about having kept &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/13/cop26-the-goal-of-15c-of-climate-heating-is-alive-but-only-just&quot;&gt;the “1.5 degrees Celsius” goal barely alive&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t know what that
means. Most nations don’t want to do anything except pay lip service and get some “leading the
charge” prestige. This is true of corporations as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In this environment, a small group of activists suggest degrowth as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; solution. Their goals
are revolutionary: They think that people will voluntarily give up the luxuries that they have
gotten used to. This is a strange thing to imagine and I am certain that it will not happen. But
I struggle with the fact that the vegan movement &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; caught steam and is becoming more and more
popular, especially in the advanced economies. Nevertheless, economies &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; grow and nations,
where large parts of the population are still stuck in abject poverty, &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; reach the standard
of living that is common everywhere else. If this growth leads to some warming, so be it. There
are gradations of outcomes and we have to choose between a set of trade-offs which ask us how
much we value the eradication of poverty against the loss of land and the increase in sea
level. I prefer the former. The degrowth movement is an expression of the frustration that some
activists have started feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Worth adding to this is David Simon’s counter to the “Less is More” cult:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are still people, getting up in newsrooms and saying “It’s alright, we are going to do
more with less.” No, you do less with less. That’s why they call it less.

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Notes and Review - Exhalation (Ted Chiang)</title>
   <link href="/2022/02/13/book-review-exhalation-chiang"/>
   <updated>2022-02-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/02/13/book-review-exhalation-chiang</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ted Chiang is a path breaking philosopher and fiction writer. I started saying that after reading
his short story “Story of Your Life.” His second book, “Exhalation”, is a collection of short
stories from 2019. It covers an even wider range of topics than his first collection. Chiang has the
ability to zoom out of the present moment and write about human nature without providing solutions
or trying to pose arguments about complex questions; instead, his writing makes the reader think
about what they would do in that situation, and that is the primary method he uses to engage the
reader in a discussion. This ability to inhabit someone else’ life for a period of time is the
reason I read fiction, and the characters in this collection are put in situations where you &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt;
to be riddled by the dilemmas and struggles that they are facing. The striking aspect of Chiang’s
short stories is the amount of time that one remembers their premise and key questions for. The key
questions in a handful of his short stories have remained with me despite having last read them 3
years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection has 9 short stories of varying length. The shortest story is only 4 pages, while the
longest one is nearly 100 pages. To review this collection without giving away spoilers, I will
focus on the recurring themes and the various ways in which Chiang approaches them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;capitalism&quot;&gt;Capitalism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “The Lifecycle of Software Objects,” one of the problems faced by the platform that hosts virtual
pets is that people don’t spend enough money on it once the initial craze fades. This tanks
profits. But the platform still has a small group of “dedicated users” who are always around and
very attached to their pets. (Remember IRC?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any “rational organization” would simply stop the platform once it stops making a profit. Or they
would find some way to make-up for the deficit: Tiered services, advertisements. However, who wants
virtual pets that show ads and recommend products to their owners every 3 minutes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the problem that is being faced by many organizations today. Platforms like Twitter,
Instagram, Facebook, Goodreads offer free services, which are very useful. But they do not make
enough of a profit to justify their own existence. And so, they have been infused with elements that
no one likes and that infusion significantly degrades the experience of everyone who uses the
platforms. This drives away even those users who think the platform is useful; worsening the doom
loop. The network effect has been a key way to keep users using the product despite a deterioration
in the UX through advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the story, the virtual pets have to engage in questionable activities to sustain
themselves. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is what platforms are already doing and will continue to have to do in the
long-term, if they are survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;time&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in his previous collection, Chiang is obsessed with our experience of time and the possibilities
that prescience or time travel would introduce&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Chiang’s writing has been a huge influence in
my thinking about anxiety, excitement, and uncertainty, emotions which are byproducts of not being
able to time travel and not being prescient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the story “The Merchant and the Alchemist’s Gate,” the author poses a question that has been
stuck in my head since I read it: *If you could travel in time, would you travel to the past or go
into the future? And would you travel within your lifetime or would you go outside of it to find out
how things turned out for everyone?*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, there is no “right” answer here. Chiang doesn’t expect us or his characters to have
a “right” answer. They think about this question and arrive at different answers depending on their
position in life. Personally, I have found myself primarily wanting to travel to the
future. Sometimes it is to the very end of my own life, to find out what happens and feel less
anxious about the present. On other occasions, I don’t want to travel into the future at all,
because I am eagerly looking forward to those experiences&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, he provides an analogy for loans and credit: You are stealing from your future
self.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;freewill&quot;&gt;Freewill&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the story “What’s Expected Of Us,” the author deals with his obsession over freewill. He does so
more directly than he did in his previous collection. The story is a warning and it is incredibly
brief: only 4 pages. The brevity of the warning is disorienting and scary because the thing that it
warns of has consequences of colossal proportions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chiang’s view, the age-old philosophical question about whether we have freewill or not is not
worth thinking about because our belief that we have freewill is essential to our continued
survival&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; our sole motivation. If there is no freewill, the story posits that a third
of everyone will lose the motivation to do anything and consequently, stop feeding
themselves. &lt;strong&gt;That&lt;/strong&gt; is how key our conception of having freewill is, for our continued survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the certainty that is projected in this story, I felt that Chiang had finally found a
resolution for his freewill obsession. I guess we will find out if that is the case when he comes
out with his next piece of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conditioning&quot;&gt;Conditioning&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s Expected Of Us” touches on the effects of losing a conditioning element that we have become
used to. Namely, our belief that we have freewill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dacey’s Patent Automatic Nanny” is an amusing story about a little boy who responds only to
machines, after being taken care of by a mechanical nanny for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the story “Omphalos,” Chiang reassures us that thinking about philosophical question such as “Who
created us?”, “What is the meaning of life?” is unnecessary because we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be fulfilled by our own
lives and we don’t need to look outside ourselves. However, we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; conditioned to look to the
majority for approval and breaking out of this shell and looking for fulfillment independently of
external input is a method to answer (or, realize that we don’t need to answer) these philosophical
questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect of being conditioned or losing some conditioning is different in each of the three cases,
in turn devastating, amusing, and enriching!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;memory&quot;&gt;Memory&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3bFCqK81s7Y&quot;&gt;TV show Black Mirror&lt;/a&gt; introduced us&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to the disadvantages of having a documented record of
&lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that we have ever done. What if we could record the accurate truth in one part of the
world and continue as usual in another part, and then, compare the experiences of each community?
Chiang tries to answer this through the story “The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling.”  In it, a
tool that can maintain a “life log” is put on a parallel track with the introduction of writing into
an oral culture. (What does not exist now but will become available in the future is put on a
parallel track with the anthropological knowledge that human beings migrated from being a
predominantly oral culture, to one which believed in recording knowledge on parchment.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is poignant: Writing is a reliable way to document events, whereas stories are
&lt;em&gt;unreliable&lt;/em&gt;. Both of them have a purpose. Unreliable memory is not inferior to reliable memory. In
fact, unreliable memory is good as it allows us to filter out the things that we don’t want to
remember. It allows us to tell our story with key milestones that might be misremembered without any
malice, because these versions fit better into the larger arc of our life. (A mishap in our past
might have put us on the path to a future success. Once we have experienced both the mishap and the
success, it is comforting to think of the mishap as a force which was driving us towards the success
we did achieve, rather than as an obstacle which prevented us from achieving something else.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If every experience you ever have is perfectly documented, it becomes impossible to engage in this
self-deception. Knowing what happened accurately does not tell you what change it produced in
you. It muddles the process of thinking of yourself as someone who has changed, as someone who has
overcome hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story made me think about my journaling habit. Was it healthy to have a journal which
documented contemporaneously the problems that I was facing? I concluded that since I give myself
the physical space to write &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; 3-4 sentences each day and ensure that the journal is not
searchable, my unreliable memory is not hindered by this reliable recounting of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;truth&quot;&gt;Truth&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the story “The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling,” Chiang theorizes that there are two types of
truths: &lt;strong&gt;What is right and what is precise.&lt;/strong&gt; What is right is based on principles, it is not a lie
if the right thing doesn’t match what happened in reality, it is simply the way that you experience
something yourself. Whereas what is precise is factual, it describes what really happened and must
be attested to by witnesses (other than the principals in an event). In cases where the documented
record is incomplete, it will be impossible to find out the precise truth. But this should not
hamper us from learning from the incident because we &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; still know what was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;parenting&quot;&gt;Parenting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this collection, the story that I liked the most was “The Lifecycle of Software Objects.” It is a
story about virtual pets that fleshes out the far far future.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If you are attached to a virtual
pet (i.e. a software object) and then that virtual pet comes to inhabit a humanoid robot, what are
your responsibilities towards it? For example, &lt;em&gt;Can&lt;/em&gt; you pause the program for a period of time, in
an effort to &lt;em&gt;protect&lt;/em&gt; your pet from something bad? Or is this unthinkable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever Chiang says in this story is applicable to parenting. The protagonist struggles with the
same kind of dilemma that parents probably struggle with: &lt;strong&gt;How do you raise children so that they
can be a good person without telling them &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what to do at each point in life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, in this story, I saw a side of Chiang’s writing that I have not experienced before. He
writes touching dialogue; reminiscent of the things children ask their parents when they are very
young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Later on, after she’s brought the mascots back from the playground to Blue Gamma’s island, Jax tells
her about his conversation with Tibo. “Tell him about fun we do time he gone. Tell him about field
trip zoo fun fun.” “Was he sad he missed it?” “No he instead argue. He said field trip was mall not
zoo. But that trip last month.” “That’s because Tibo was suspended the whole time he’s been gone,”
Ana explains, “so he thinks last month’s trip was yesterday.” “I say that,” says Jax, surprising her
with his understanding, “but he not believe. He argue until Marco and Lolly too tell him. Then he
sad.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“No,” says Jax. He stops and walks back to her avatar. “Don’t want play.” “What? Sure you do.” “No
playing. Want job.” Ana laughs. “What? Why do you want to get a job?” “Get money.” She realizes that
Jax isn’t happy when he says this; his mood is glum. More seriously, she asks him, “What do you need
money for?” “Don’t need. Give you.” “Why do you want to give me money?” “You need,” he says,
matter-of-factly. “Did I say I need money? When?” “Last week ask why you play with other digients
instead me. You said people pay you play with them. If have money, can pay you. Then you play with
me more.” “Oh, Jax.” She’s momentarily at a loss for words. “That’s very sweet of you.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;None of the digients was raised on bedtime stories, so text doesn’t fascinate them the way it does
human children, but their general curiosity–along with the praise of their owners–motivates them to
explore the uses that text can be put to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Ted Chiang in “The Lifecycle of Software Objects”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broken English of the virtual pets here is very similar to the way children talk when they are
learning a language. It is the most endearing section of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He even sneaks in a reference to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fourweekmba.com/alignment-problem/&quot;&gt;Alignment Problem&lt;/a&gt; faced by people who are building artificial
intelligence systems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You won’t believe what my Natasha did today! We were at the playground, and another digient hurt
himself when he fell and was crying. Natasha gave him a hug to make him feel better, and I praised
her to high heaven. Next thing I know, she pushes over another digient to make him cry, hugs him,
and looks to me for praise!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Ted Chiang in “The Lifecycle of Software Objects”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short story collection is well worth the few hours that you would spend reading it, and the
several hours after that, which you would spend thinking about the themes and subjects that Chiang
broaches.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the list of short stories in Exhalation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Dacey’s Patent Automatic Nanny&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Great Silence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Omphalos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In fact, the first story is about this topic and it got me very excited about the rest of the collection. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is the kind of kooky stuff you will start thinking about once you read this collection too! “Reader, beware!” (For me, “Reader, rejoice!” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Although not completely fleshed out, I think the thinking goes something like this: If you could travel in time, then you would travel into the future, borrow money from your future self, come back to the present, invest in a “sure thing,” and earn the money that you are going to lend to your past self. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Chiang explores similar themes in “Story of Your Life.” These themes were muddled in the movie adaptation, Arrival (2016). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I realized that Chiang gave the collection a symbolic happy ending even in the order in which the effects of conditioning are presented. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Black Mirror episode “The Entire History of You” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I agonized over whether my assertion here that realistic virtual pets, as described in this short story, are not going to come about in the “near future” was a wise one. Being pessimistic about the adoption of new technology and tools though, I am willing to make this assertion. (Despite having the ability to share high quality video feeds when talking with someone, we don’t use it often or for long periods of time due to the unsolved fatigue of video calls. TODO Link post here.) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:7&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you like Chiang’s writing, I would recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-ted-chiang.html&quot;&gt;this conversation&lt;/a&gt; in which he talks about climate change, fears about AI, and the overwhelming power of capitalism. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:8&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Thoughts About The Beatles Documentary</title>
   <link href="/2022/02/11/beatles-get-back-special-presentation"/>
   <updated>2022-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/02/11/beatles-get-back-special-presentation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found out about the Beatles documentary from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/756/but-i-did-everything-right&quot;&gt;podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;. The host was talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07q95KiVguc&quot;&gt;a clip&lt;/a&gt;
showing the Beatles legend, Paul McCartney, composing the song “Get Back.” The stunning part of this
video was that he had started from nothing. He was idly strumming chords on his guitar, early in the
morning. Ringo Starr and George Harrison were sitting across from him; they appeared disheveled,
tired, and sleepy. The final Beatle, John Lennon, was nowhere to be seen. I watched this video a few
times; hoping to get a glimpse of something around McCartney which gave him the inspiration to come
up with the melody. I wonder if other viewers were watching the video looking for a similar kind of
revelation. But there was nothing. McCartney had created the song out of nothing; like a vaguely
remembered dream converted into a beautiful melody. I learned more about what the documentary was
and where the footage had come from. (Admittedly, I went through this information gathering process
in a frenzy.) This past week, some theater chains in Japan capitalized on the mania of Beatles fans
by airing a 1-hour special, &lt;strong&gt;The Rooftop Concert&lt;/strong&gt;, for a limited period of time. I watched the
special, and here are some thoughts about my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching the special was a jarring experience: &lt;strong&gt;It shows London in the late 1960s in
high-definition, color video.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, all of the footage I have seen from before 1990 has been grainy and monochrome. Color
movies have been around since the 1940s; but I had not seen any documentary which was shot in color
&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; high resolution until now. The reason I attributed for this is that all of the media that we
consume from the 20th century was recorded off a TV screen, possibly originally recorded on tape
using the VCR and later digitized. The resolution supported by satellite TV sets back then was much
lower than our modern standards of “High-Definition.” So, the only way to get higher quality footage
would be to go back to the original tapes with raw footage; digitize those tapes; re-edit the
documentary in the same manner; and release the HD digital version of the same documentary. It does
not make much economic sense to do this for most documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first couple minutes, we see footage from around London. I was tempted to believe that this
was a period movie. This temptation is strong almost throughout the hour-long performance. It is
especially strong when either spectators or the view on the street is shown. On the street, people
are shown standing around during their lunch hour and listening to the performance on the roof of a
building on Savile Row, the street on which the Beatles had a studio where they recorded their
albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so used to seeing the Beatles perform through videos on YouTube that the scenes which included
them were the most comforting of the bunch. They perform 6-7 songs on the roof of their
building. There is much drama surrounding three police officers who are trying to get them to turn
down the racket, owing to noise complaints from other residents and businesses in the
vicinity. There are some “taking the crowd’s temperature” interviews happening on the
street. Questions are posed to the spectators who are standing around listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hour-long special used IMAX technology, which meant a larger than normal screen and particularly
sharp, surround-sound audio. This made the whole experience a lot of fun. I had resigned myself to
being able to listen to bands from the 20th century &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; on domestic audio equipment. The full
version of this documentary, about 8 hours long, has already been released on Disney+ (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hotstar.com/id/tv/the-beatles-get-back/1260073692&quot;&gt;Hotstar&lt;/a&gt;,
if you are in India). So, I caught myself thinking about whether it was worth going to the theater
to watch something that was already available to me online, on demand.  However, just as quickly, I
realized that I was comparing two completely different experiences.  (Irrespective of how good or
bad a movie is, I have never regretted watching it in the theater. So, your mileage might vary.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was taken aback by how &lt;em&gt;familiar&lt;/em&gt; London looked. I have never been there myself, and all my prior
knowledge of it has been through either news footage or TV shows set in Britain. Particularly
familiar was the attire of everyone on the street. Even the cars that were on the street and mundane
details like the glasses that people were wearing: Everything just seemed &lt;em&gt;familiar&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;period&lt;/em&gt;
appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not explain this familiarity, or my heightened sensitivity to it, because my understanding
was that fashion has changed significantly since the 1960s. One possible explanation is that our
expectations of each period have been conditioned by frighteningly &lt;strong&gt;accurate&lt;/strong&gt; portrayals. This
conditioning has made &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; historical footage neither surprising nor disorienting, as they simply
serve to confirm one’s prior expectations of the period being depicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions on the streets brought out a very interesting phenomenon, to whose existence I had not
paid the requisite attention. The Beatles were not universally liked. They were very popular, but
many people thought that their music was too similar to &lt;em&gt;pop music&lt;/em&gt;; too simple; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In6gCrGeZfA&quot;&gt;“very indulgent,”
as Bob Dylan&lt;/a&gt; quipped. Liking the Beatles was a &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; rebellious act in the 60s, I presume. Only
slightly because their lyrics were wholesome and there was little of disrepute or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9gLmBgUTV4&quot;&gt;“Satanic
influence”&lt;/a&gt; there that someone could reasonably complain about. Indeed, two adults say that they have
not heard the Beatles themselves, but that their children buy their records. Liking pop music,
ironically, is always frowned upon by &lt;em&gt;someone.&lt;/em&gt; There were two elderly people who were unhappy
about the racket. One of them complains about having been woken up from her sleep. That, I thought,
was a funny touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drama with the policemen leaves one feeling conflicted. They were doing their job in trying to
stop the performance. When the policemen reach the roof and are standing behind the band, &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; the
band is performing, McCartney turns back and looks at them multiple times. His demeanor clearly
shifts after the first time he looks back and notices that the police are trying to shut them
down. This renewed perception of the performance as an act of rebellion seems to energize him. He
starts smiling, and is clearly willing to taunt and defy the policemen, should it come to that. As
their last song, Get Back, comes to an end, he adds a few impromptu lines about how the police don’t
like them performing on the roof and might even arrest them for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have one final thought about the 1-hour special: The questions that were asked on the street were
&lt;em&gt;cringe worthy.&lt;/em&gt; The conversation always seems to run something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you know what you are hearing?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt; It is the Beatles, right?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Do you like it? / Would you buy their records?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, absolutely. I love them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, like this (probably worse):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you know what you are hearing?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt; No&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; It is the Beatles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, okay&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you like the Beatles? / Would you buy their records?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, I will try it out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time the interviewer said “The Beatles,” I cringed. I think that this idea to ask people on
the street about the performance was the documentary producers’. Perhaps, they wanted to show that
the band was well-liked, and that this stunt would pay-off big time. However, for a band as popular
and well-known in the 1960s as them, I thought that it was superfluous to repeat this conversation
several times and get people to approve of their music. At times, it felt like pandering to a future
audience; an indirect way of saying “The Beatles were a big deal back then. We knew that. You should
know that too, viewer in the future.” I did not get any kind of wholesome message. The producers
could have been secure in the Beatles’ position as a genre-changing musical force.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Monthly Recommendations (January 2022)</title>
   <link href="/2022/01/31/monthly-recommendations-2022-january"/>
   <updated>2022-01-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/01/31/monthly-recommendations-2022-january</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the first recommendations post of the year, I have picked out some of the best New Yorker
stories that I read as I worked through my issue backlog from early 2020. I have given up on reading
the New Yorker at the pace at which it is published. However, the articles that are included in each
issue are rarely “current affairs” related and can basically be read and re-read years into the
future. Lately, the role played by magazines in our reading diets has become clearer to me: They are
published at a much faster pace than great fiction or non-fiction; while they are written by the
very same people who will eventually produce those great works; so magazine pieces offer us a window
into upcoming great work. (I think.) So, this month I have a mix of dealing with grief, bad
governance as seen through the eyes of an official, compared with the impact of bad policy as seen
through the eyes of a journalist, the “mad science”-y feel of triggering avalanches intentionally to
avoid larger avalanches, and a disturbing article about the effects of late-stage capitalism on
workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On The Warpath: A profile of John Bolton (Filkins)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/06/john-bolton-on-the-warpath&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/2020.12.14-163255/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/06/john-bolton-on-the-warpath&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). 6 May, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;How do the people inside government really work? Several meetings with people who have radically
 different view on subjects; an exchange of opinions which will most probably end with no one
 changing their mind; access to decision makers and the people in charge being closely
 controlled. Most of this portrayed on TV shows about the government: Veep, about the peculiar
 American system; and Yes, Prime Minister, about the more common Parliamentary system. This
 profile is another confirmation that this is really how governments work in reality too. Bolton
 was one of the people in Trump’s cast of national security advisors. Bolton’s main feature was
 that he was &lt;em&gt;hawkish,&lt;/em&gt; which is a polite way of saying “war-mongerer,” as far as I can
 tell. His appointment seems to have simply fueled the lone wolf mentality that was prevalent in
 the Trump administration right from the beginning. This quote from an official under him is
 priceless:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Under Bolton, there are fewer meetings, less collaboration; he often disappears into his office
to immerse himself in documents. … “He reads the memos. There just isn’t a lot of feedback.”
Some former officials believe that Bolton’s insularity could be dangerous, particularly in a
crisis, when various arms of the government and the military have to mount a quick and
coordinated response. “It’s chaos under Bolton,” the former senior national-security official
told me. “The national-security adviser is supposed to facilitate the President’s directives and
coordinate national policy among the various government agencies. That process has completely
broken down.” The official added, “Bolton hasn’t set any priorities. No one knows what the
policies are–what’s important, what’s less important. …”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Principals’ meetings–crucial gatherings involving the President, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and
the heads of intelligence agencies–have become rare. “I don’t remember the last time there was
a fucking principals’ meeting,” the official said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I don’t think anyone wants to hear &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; about their government’s functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Science can be used to study practically anything because the application of the scientific
 method is not constrained by the field that one is applying it to. This article is about the
 application of the method to the prediction of natural disasters. Avalanches are fascinating
 because it’s hard to imagine how they begin or how they can get as terribly big as they
 generally do. They also happen to form almost entirely mysteriously with everything happening
 below the surface with precious little to monitor. This article is about the patrollers whose
 job it is to forecast avalanches (in an effort to protect skiers) and to trigger small
 avalanches which will not cause any harm to avoid the large avalanches which are generally
 devastating. There is a lot of science behind all this including scales to measure the risk of
 an avalanche and the mechanics of accumulation of snow on a slope. This article was a fun
 read. (I don’t do any winter sports, so it was mostly just fascinating that this kind of rigor
 existed in what I had considered to be &lt;em&gt;basically&lt;/em&gt; a random event which no one could predict.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is an article foreshadowing an unusual and scary phenomenon that will occur in late-stage
capitalism. As businesses try to reduce their costs progressively, almost everything will be
automated. While there is widespread debate about how &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; will be automated, it is certainly
more than the state we are in right now. It follows that large groups of people will probably
lose jobs in the future. Ezra Klein has repeated in multiple podcast episodes of The Ezra Klein
Show that the loss of people’s jobs is not just a problem which economists need to deal with, it
is problem that society has to think about &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the coming wave of job losses. The reason for
this is that the jobs that people are involved in are more than just a source for money: It is
the source of dignity for workers. When this source is suddenly taken away from them, they’ll
face the kind of disillusionment that leads to societal collapse. Most countries are not thinking
about this problem because it still seems far off. Whether this problem will even occur is up for
debate because Japan is facing a severe shortage of labor because of an aging population and a
dropping birth rate. The dropping birth rate seems to be common and unavoidable as even China,
the latest to enter the late-stage of its development, is facing an identical
problem. Nevertheless, how will economies that are putting their eggs in the capitalism basket
deal with the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As the withdrawal of America from Afghanistan played out over the last few weeks of August 2021, two
prominent, prior American withdrawals came to mind: America’s partial withdrawal from Afghanistan
in 2003, to focus on the war effort in Iraq; and America’s subsequent withdrawal from Iraq about 8
years after the overthrow of Iraq’s leader Saddam. Both these withdrawals ended up relegating the
countries to various
states of ruin. Afghanistan’s new Taliban leadership seems committed to &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; form of governance
that doesn’t allow regional militias to have undue influence over the general public. Iraq’s
government barely saved the country from becoming a failed state, and is in the painful process of
recovery; especially because it is unable to provide even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c7AuSQdvow&quot;&gt;the basic necessities of life to its
people&lt;/a&gt;. America’s withdrawal from Syria was orchestrated by Trump as part of his policy to end
long-running wars and it was an equally large catastrophe. This article focuses on the confusion
within the American military hierarchy and the crucial misunderstandings between Trump, who was
in charge of policy, and the rank-and-file generals, who were
in charge of communicating upcoming policy decisions to their Syrian allies.  The article
highlights the damage that was done to Syria’s future. It is unclear who is to blame for this
misunderstanding; even if the blame &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be pinned on someone, it would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlJmW3sFPEI&quot;&gt;futile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I have stopped using Instagram and Facebook. This has led to no
communication with people who are exclusively on one of those 2 platforms.  I have known
(subconsciously) that my refusal to use these services for reasons that involve &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; well being
or &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; ideology is a selfish and subversive refusal to stay &lt;em&gt;connected&lt;/em&gt; with these people. This
article was an uncomfortable account of what it feels like to be on the other side of this
divide. It also made me think more about how drastically our expectations about communication
have changed in a relatively short period of time. “Stay in touch” was a corporate euphemism for
“Remember that we worked together because it might be mutually beneficial in the future.” Now,
this phrase has become commonplace &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; among friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Video Calls Are Tiring</title>
   <link href="/2022/01/29/video-calls-tiring"/>
   <updated>2022-01-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/01/29/video-calls-tiring</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Video calls are ubiquitous. Skype and its modern counterparts were the go-to tool for connecting
people who were not in the same physical space. In the era when travel was possible, convenient, and
exciting&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, these tools were stopgap solutions; to be employed &lt;em&gt;until the time that&lt;/em&gt; you could
refill your “physical presence” account balance with people. Then, COVID19. Everyone was stuck at
home. Travel became impossible. Video calls became the only way to meet some people. At work, the
number of people that I interact with on a daily basis whom I have never met in real life has gone
up from 0 in March 2020 to 5 this past week. I don’t think my experience is an outlier. The
necessity of using this tool could not be escaped; neither could the feeling of tiredness that would
always follow its use. What is the source of this tiredness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental characteristics of a video call have remained depressingly constant since the
initial days of Skype: a small rectangle with your face and a large rectangle with the other
person’s face. Consider this quote from a 2011 article in the New York Times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But the disconcerting thing, he said – as others have mentioned – is that the current technology
means one is rarely looking eye to eye. “When someone doesn’t look us in the eye, the brain deduces
this as someone being less likable, less confident and less honest”
– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/21/your-money/21shortcuts.html&quot;&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/21/your-money/21shortcuts.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens, the “current technology” of today, 2022, still does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; let you look eye-to-eye. To
exacerbate the problem, there has been a wild expansion of the primary use-case, “establishing
business relationships,” which was being considered in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video calls replaced every activity that called for congregation: work, school, happy hour, dance
classes. They are &lt;strong&gt;a poor replacement&lt;/strong&gt; for congregation; no one is on that side of the debate
anymore. Conversations about video calls replacing in-person meetings were in vogue in 2011, and
they were in vogue early in the pandemic, when work-from-home was reducing work travel and giving an
unprecedented amount of flexibility to employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adults might be surprisingly good at using these tools for work. Children are not doing well using
them for school. I will repeat the oft-repeated truism: “Video calls lack the &lt;em&gt;human touch&lt;/em&gt;.” Every
uttered sentence is quickly transformed into a cold, emotionless gob of words, devoid of facial
expressions and hand gestures, making the communication of a simply sentiment tortuously hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the &lt;em&gt;best worst solution&lt;/em&gt; for the problem that faced &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; everyone. But people in jobs
that involved meeting people for 8 hours a day noticed early on that &lt;strong&gt;they were tired&lt;/strong&gt; after meeting
a lot of people online. And more so than they would have been had they been meeting the same people
in person. I felt the same way during the workdays when I had meetings for several hours at a
stretch.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial explanation of this tired feeling was external to the primary communication tool. The
blamed was pinned on other plausible sources of anxiety: the news cycle was crazy and we were
bombarded with depressing information (China, Italy, New York, …); spaces at home were not
designed to be conducive to a comfortable work day anyway; we &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; did not have the right
equipment, and other arguments in this vein. This went on for some time. However, these explanations
were not enough. People were tired and the reasons had nothing to do with external factors. They
started looking within and at the tools that they had taken for granted until then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was soon an explanation that involved &lt;strong&gt;performance anxiety:&lt;/strong&gt; online performers and live
streamers who had been broadcasting for a long time said that &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; video calls are performances and
everyone is on a stage. Moreover, this online stage is worse than a physical stage because it is
equipped with a mirror which shows you what you look like.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This explanation made sense to me. Even though I did not think of video calls as a performance, I
saw that I was transfixed by the small rectangle that I was broadcasting. This small rectangle had
no new information; I should not have been looking at it at all. Nevertheless, it was the natural
resting place for my vision on the screen and I kept returning to it every few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this explanation of performance anxiety, I want to add 2 supplementary points. I believe that
these exacerbate our anxiety and self-consciousness, and make our experience of video calls
unnatural and tiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;strange-proportions&quot;&gt;Strange Proportions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the unnatural size of the opposite person. My phone screen is 5 inches tall and 3 inches
wide. The average human face is approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reference.com/science/average-size-human-head-62364d028e431bf3&quot;&gt;10 inches tall and 7 inches wide&lt;/a&gt;. To deal with this
problematic difference in proportions, wide-angle cameras take to cropping the feed
appropriately. This gives rise to a mash-up of strange proportions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the speaker is sitting too far off, a small face surrounded by empty space. And if the speaker is
holding the phone too close, an impossibly large face that takes up the whole screen. There is no
way to win. I noticed that I always ended up with a video feed which is great for the first few
minutes of a conversation when I was assessing it with curiosity. As the conversation continued and
I focused on what the speaker was saying rather than where they were or what they were up to, the
strange proportions became unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are recommendations to fix this: “Keep the camera fixed. It should line up with your line of
sight.  Sit in a chair at a comfortable distance from the screen.” This advice is easy to follow
when you are at work inside your house. But when you are on a video call with family, it is hard to
stay in a single place and maintain unchanged posture for long periods at a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;expectation-to-not-look-away-from-the-screen&quot;&gt;Expectation to Not Look Away from the Screen&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking away from the screen &lt;strong&gt;during&lt;/strong&gt; a video call is taboo. When meeting someone for the first time
at work, I will tell them that I am looking away from the camera because I am writing on a notebook
in front of me and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; because I am being rude. The expectation to not look away is strong. It is
a sign of politeness online, where the other person can’t see what you are staring at off-camera. My
assumption is that the other person will assume the worst thing about an innocuous off-camera look:
namely, that I am reading a tabloid article on my phone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In real life, we rarely stare at another person’s face for a long period of time. Even when two
people are talking, there are often things around them and looking at these things for a brief
moment or moving your head around is a natural way to break up the monotony of an unchanging
physical stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This realization came to me through Japanese lessons. When the lessons were conducted in real-life,
I rarely looked at my instructor’s face when I was working on assignments or answering questions. I
would spend most of the time looking at blank walls, trying to come up with the vocabulary or the
grammar for describing a particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the lessons shifted online, there was no expectation (either my own or my instructor’s) that I
would stare at the screen/camera because I had never done that before. During these online lessons,
I would often stare outside a window to my left or at the wall to my right. These 1-hour lessons
were not as tiring as similar one-on-one meetings at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, unbeknownst to myself, I started applying the same tactics during my one-on-one meetings
too. Through this exercise, I consciously weakened the expectation that I wouldn’t look
away. Looking at your surroundings is a part of being natural offline. There is no reason there
should be any expectation that we are stiff and monotonous online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video conferencing software will often put the “shared screen” of the other person front-and-center
and hide the person’s face in a sidebar. Google Meet used to do this by default before. If both
people are staring at the shared document, they are not staring at each other’s faces. This is a
good start, however it is not a sufficient solution because the underlying expectation about not
looking away from the screen is just as strong as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tiredness was coined early in the pandemic: &lt;strong&gt;Zoom fatigue.&lt;/strong&gt; Technology philosopher &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/a-theory-of-zoom-fatigue&quot;&gt;L M Sacasas&lt;/a&gt;
theorizes that Zoom fatigue is related to the way we perceive each other’s bodies on a video call. A
video call &lt;em&gt;pretends&lt;/em&gt; to be equivalent to a physical meeting, despite being a terrible imitation:
there is neither the comforting, shared physical space as in real-life conversations, or the
intentional disembodiment of the telephone. The physical cues that our evolutionary history has
trained us to look for are expected, but missing. Video calls are good for communication, but they
are decidedly bad for people.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom fatigue does not have &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.stanford.edu/2021/02/23/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions/&quot;&gt;a simple solution&lt;/a&gt;. One solution is to stick to the “intentional
disembodiment of the telephone.” A better solution is to start by sharing video and subsequently,
switching to only audio.  (It is hard to get the timing right.) The solution that I prefer is to cut
through the pretense that video calls are &lt;strong&gt;“real-life conversations with caveats.”&lt;/strong&gt; If we start
thinking about them as &lt;strong&gt;“telephone conversations with a few perks,”&lt;/strong&gt; video calls will be less tiring
and more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;… and not ridden with the anxiety of getting an RT-PCR test result in a foreign country. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Being at a company where I was not required to turn on my camera for all meetings, I resorted to turning my camera off and pacing around the room whenever I could. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Google Meet implemented a feature which would fix this problem: It allowed people to hide the video feed that they were streaming. This feature is not persistent, i.e. you have to hide your feed in every video call, which can get tiring in itself. Other applications such as WhatsApp and Facetime which are more commonly used in family settings don’t have any such feature yet. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;

   <title>Nostalgia vs. Anxiety on Social Media</title>
   <link href="/2022/01/16/nostalgia-vs-anxiety-on-social-media"/>
   <updated>2022-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2022/01/16/nostalgia-vs-anxiety-on-social-media</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When Facebook came on the scene, the most attractive features on the platform for me were photo
albums and life events. These two features in combination gave the user the ability to build a
timeline of their life. Every trip that you go on, place that you visit, and dinner that you eat
&lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be documented for the present and archived for the future. The photos and events were arranged
as milestones that the user &lt;em&gt;chose&lt;/em&gt; to retain when they told their story.  The digitized nature of
this data enabled the creation of works that were out of reach for the ordinary scrapbooker or the
amateur video editor: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/8WIdJs0v3LM&quot;&gt;personalized Facebook “Lookback” videos&lt;/a&gt;, which were generated for
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/4/5376396/facebook-look-back-video-lets-you-relive-the-last-ten-years-of-your-online-life&quot;&gt;Facebook’s 10th anniversary&lt;/a&gt;, were the biggest “proof-of-concept” of a world which was digitizing at
a fast pace. I feel that Facebook was at “peak utility” back then. &lt;em&gt;Nostalgia&lt;/em&gt; was the currency that
the platform traded in effortlessly. Product managers at Facebook intuitively understood the value
that they were creating in their users’ lives. Looking at the Lookback video is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; like looking
back at photo albums from a decade ago because in the latter experience there is no
curation. However, Facebook’s usage is on the decline. Platforms that focus on creating &lt;em&gt;Anxiety&lt;/em&gt; in
their users’ minds are on the rise. Did something fundamental change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really liked&lt;/em&gt; my personalized Lookback video released in 2014 and I must have watched it at least
a dozen times, noticing new details every time I re-watched it. Facebook used technology to build
something that could not have been built without it; they produced something for everyone which was,
until then, out of reach for amateurs. I can say this without any qualification: Facebook &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; at
its peak utility at that point in time. I wonder if I would have continued to use Facebook if it had
stood out as the only platform that focused on nostalgia, among a gaggle of platforms that focused
on making people anxious by showing them what everyone was else doing &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;; a wave of
products that ostensibly began with Snapchat Stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most popular platforms of today are good at sharing “the current moment.” They deal in the
currency of &lt;em&gt;Anxiety.&lt;/em&gt; They force their users to share the present, which fuels an urgent need to do
&lt;em&gt;something interesting.&lt;/em&gt; Why did social media become a place where archiving lost its value and
sharing the present with a large audience was the primary objective?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popular platforms of this new era are Tik Tok, Instagram, and Snapchat. Tik Tok is the only
platform that tries to get its users to produce content that is widely shared and holds for a
relatively long period of time&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Instagram and Snapchat are completely invested in the “right
now.” Their investment in the “now” is different from the historical goals of Facebook. On Facebook,
you share what’s happening now for the benefit of the future. When you create a Life Event on
Facebook, that event stays there forever, just as the event changes you, the event changes your
Facebook timeline. When you add a photo to your Instagram Story, it disappears in 24 hours. Nothing
you do on these platforms has any lasting impact anymore. Archiving has become a thing of the
past. Even in the cases where content &lt;em&gt;goes viral,&lt;/em&gt; the phenomenon has a dizzyingly short
lifespans&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no question about the currency that is valued higher in capitalism. &lt;em&gt;Nostalgia&lt;/em&gt; has its
place in society, but &lt;em&gt;Anxiety&lt;/em&gt; is where the money is at. When things are going to disappear in 24
hours, you probably want to consume them right away, procrastinating for a few hours. A newspaper
that publishes every 10 minutes will have significantly higher turnover than one that publishes
every day, as long as people are interested in the content and the content producers can work at
that rate. With everyone signing up to produce and consume content, both those conditions are met in
the “push notification newspaper” world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anxiety&lt;/em&gt; (in my opinion) is the manifestation of scarcity that is sensed in a system. There are
limited seats in a movie theater and if you really want to watch a movie, watch it as soon as you
can and book the ticket as soon as they are available. Artificial scarcity marketing techniques work
well for brick-and-mortar businesses like Apple (which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef_BznBwktw&quot;&gt;used to have cash sales&lt;/a&gt;) and even publishing
houses that used to release books that people would wait for several hours to get their hands
on. (Rowling’s Harry Potter series comes to mind.) “Don’t put things off because you might lose the
opportunity to &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; experience them.” This insight into the effect that enforcing scarcity would
have on their users’ minds was the driving principle behind the product that started this modern
wave of platforms: Snapchat Stories.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archiving the past has been delegated to other platforms like Google Photos and Apple’s
iCloud. These services also attempt to create artsy videos using your pictures, grouping them by
location and the people that you are with. The data that Google or Apple have about your pictures is
an insignificant subset of the data that Facebook had about the same pictures.  These auto-generated
videos can’t be compared to what Facebook created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook had the ability to figure out what was important to &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;. Facebook &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; about your most
liked post. The more life-changing your announcement, the more people are going to engage with it;
the more people will congratulate you, and so on&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Apple and Google have no idea about the
importance of any life event or even about the presence of a life event behind a set of pictures,
that were taken in close spacial or temporal proximity. The effects of this ignorance are clear when
one sees iCloud’s attempts to build videos. &lt;strong&gt;Every video looks the same.&lt;/strong&gt; They are templates
rendered with different photos. There’s no &lt;strong&gt;personalization.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s no understanding of how
important a set of pictures was &lt;strong&gt;to the user.&lt;/strong&gt; Even the name of the auto-generated video is just an
amalgamation of the month that pictures were taken in and the places where the pictures were taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will the value of archiving rise again? After all, the Sepia tone filter is a mainstay on most
Camera applications today and people still post old pictures to Instagram Stories on Mothers’
Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think archiving will make a significant comeback. Human nature has not changed. I will not
argue that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the thought process behind nostalgia has changed as people understood how to use the online
tools that were at their disposal. Online tools prefer things that can be safely publicized. The
ability to share content is key for the creator of &lt;em&gt;successful&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; online content. Private
experiences have their own space, but those spaces are an afterthought in modern
platforms. &lt;strong&gt;Experiences that create Nostalgia are private. Experiences that create Anxiety &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be
publicized.&lt;/strong&gt; A Lookback video is interesting to the subject and the handful of people who are
closest to them. A Snapchat highlight about their recent trip to Europe is mildly interesting to
almost everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new platform might come around which tries to work with nostalgia and convince its users that
&lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; feelings about the past are more important than &lt;em&gt;others’ admiration&lt;/em&gt; of the
present. Personally, I am pessimistic about the return of nostalgia because the success of modern
platforms has convinced me that &lt;strong&gt;we&lt;/strong&gt; continue to disregard Seneca’s advice from over 2000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t take pleasure in the majority’s approval.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Everything is relative to the average attention span of the modern user which is at a dismal low. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/us/devious-licks-tiktok.html&quot;&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/08/us/frozen-honey-challenge-tiktok.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&quot;&gt;trends&lt;/a&gt; evade explanation with their absurdity. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ironically, Snapchat lost to Instagram because it could not address the scarcity problem that it was facing: the scarcity of users. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I am putting this here as a historical view of the platform’s operation. I haven’t used the platform lately, so my views about the posts that gain likes and engagement might be outdated. However, I believe that the basic assumption that more people will congratulate you the larger the importance of an event still holds true, irrespective of how behavior might have changed online. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Success has different yardsticks of measurement. Here, I will simply equate success (in the mind of the content creator) to the number of likes that a post eventually gets. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Letter 7. Letters From A Stoic (Seneca) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Monthly Recommendations (December 2021)</title>
   <link href="/2021/12/31/monthly-recommendations-2021-december"/>
   <updated>2021-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/12/31/monthly-recommendations-2021-december</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is no specific theme for this month’s recommendation list. It is an assortment of the articles
I read over the past year which had one thing in common: I wanted more people to read them and
decide what they thought about the underlying institutions and people that these articles
described. So, we have two articles about the tennis world: one about an athlete within the world
and another about the incentive structure of the sport; one article about a non-contrarian CEO with
some interesting ideas about running companies that he does not divulge, and another one about a
politician with new realizations that helped him confirm 3 nominees to the US Supreme Court even
though the confirmation of a single Supreme Court nominee was hailed as a big achievement just a few
years ago on &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/m-qUfg6TjG8&quot;&gt;the TV Show, West Wing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naomi Osaka and tennis journalism’s ugly history of demeaning its players (Abad-Santos)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/22534957/naomi-osaka-french-open-wimbledon&quot;&gt;Vox&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.today/2021.12.31-150413/https://www.vox.com/22534957/naomi-osaka-french-open-wimbledon&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). 17 June, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Naomi Osaka decided to take a break from tennis after she was fined for refusing to appear at
post-match press conferences at the French Open. The moment she announced this was &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/EqboAI-Vk-U?t=31&quot;&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; in
Google’s Year In Search 2021 video. It was a major event in tennis; it was a major event in
sports in general: A player decided to stop playing the sport because they could not deal with
pressure from the journalists who cover that sport.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I don’t agree with the viewpoint of this article from Vox. Vox has been noticeably moving to the
liberal left in the past year, especially since the departure of the two founders and more of the
founding staff. This article seems to be another indication of this. Sports has &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; been just
about the game that is being played. It has always been about the human element: People play
these games and it is these people we are interested in, more than anything else. This was
important for me in understanding the disgusting behavior of the spectators at the US Open 2018
final between Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams who were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2018-09-08/naomi_osaka_derails_serena_williams_in_dramatic_final.html&quot;&gt;booing the victor&lt;/a&gt;. If it was all about the
sport, people would not be booing anyone because they got to see a good fight.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If the athlete decides to just leave and not talk to anyone until they have had the chance to
re-watch their performance and talk to their coaches/PR consultants to decide what they are going
to say, the apparent “raw” element of sports is lost. This shift might not be a bad thing, but if
this really does happen, the group of spectators will also change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Few Tennis Pros Make a Fortune. Most Barely Scrape By. (Steinberger)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/magazine/tennis-players-association.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.today/2021.07.05-082124/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/magazine/tennis-players-association.html&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). 29 June, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The incentive structure inside the professional tennis world is messed up. There are multiple
tiers of competitions in which professionals early in their career must compete and win to get
spots in the noticeable tournaments. These early tournaments are tiring and often played without
any sponsorship. A player that does manage to travel and compete in these early tournaments will
face the daunting task of defeating a well-rested seeded player in the more popular
tournaments. This system is beneficial to players who have already made it and perhaps answers
the question about why the established players from 10 years ago are still the established
players of today (Nadal, Federer, Williams). The New Yorker published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/futures&quot;&gt;fictional take&lt;/a&gt; of the
same problem, showing the state of a player who depends on benefactors to pay for his practice
and travel, and develops a relationship with the donor’s offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These Chinese Millenials Are ‘Chilling,’ and Beijing Isn’t Happy (Chen)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/03/world/asia/china-slackers-tangping.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.today/2021.07.10-061529/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/03/world/asia/china-slackers-tangping.html&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). 3 July, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Opting out of the rat race is not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a personal choice in China. It is an interesting
problem for a government to solve. Governments have been working to increase the workforce
participation rate for several decades. But if they work their population too hard, the efforts
are bound to boomerang and blow up in the government’s faces. This is a good indication of what
late-stage looks like in the socialism/capitalism hybrid that the Chinese economy is based
on&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We have already seen what late-stage socialism looks like in Europe with the
pro-status-quo, anti-immigrant sentiment that has been growing over the past few years. In
America, late-stage capitalism has manifested as dizzying inequality between executives and
workers. India’s capitalism-based economy seems to be heading towards the inequality
scenario. Looking to other economies, identifying parallels, and trying to prevent them is a
worthwhile exercise that policymakers seem uninterested to engage themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does Palantir See Too Much? (Steinberger)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/21/magazine/palantir-alex-karp.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.today/2020.10.30-150748/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/21/magazine/palantir-alex-karp.html&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). 21 Oct, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The present is the time of the contrarian CEO. Just look at Elon Musk and his cavalier usage of
his Twitter account to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-can-t-stop-taunting-the-sec&quot;&gt;poke fun at regulators&lt;/a&gt; despite being burned before. This article is a
profile of Palantir’s founder Alex Karp. Karp is a contrarian CEO, who thrives on the mystery
that he is able to generate. He is also non-conforming in the way that he runs the company. He
talks about how the “team” is more important than everything else; which is similar to a lot of
other software companies and not contrarian at all. But one of the advantages of his “let us
maintain the mystery about Palantir” routine is that it makes it impossible to tell whether he is
running the company in the standard fashion or if he is doing something truly contrarian. This
article is a fun read simply due to the eccentric nature of the CEO. (Take for instance, his
“inability to be norm-conforming and marry.” Or his flight to Germany to study German and read
the writers and thinkers he was drawn to in their mother tongue.) The way that Karp talks about
himself and Palantir in this article makes it seem like a cult. This &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be the very effect
that Karp is going for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabler-in-Chief (Mayer)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/20/how-mitch-mcconnell-became-trumps-enabler-in-chief&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.today/2021.01.03-174602/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/20/how-mitch-mcconnell-became-trumps-enabler-in-chief&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). 20 April, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The American political system is ridden with veto points which can be exercised by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/19/politics/joe-manchin-build-back-better/index.html&quot;&gt;a single
person&lt;/a&gt;. This also means that a single person who is able to keep their party’s policymakers
together in an unbreakable coalition is extremely valuable. Former Senate majority leader Mitch
McConnell from the Republican party was just such a man. He was able to keep &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the Senators
from his party united towards a single goal, a staggering number of times during his 5-year term
as the majority leader (since 2015). The one time that he had some doubt about whether he would
be able to keep his caucus together was when Obama nominated a Supreme Court justice in his
election year. On this occasion, McConnell decided to keep this from &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; being voted on. Even
during the last few chaotic weeks of the Trump presidency, McConnell managed to confirm 1 Supreme
Court justice and prevent the impeachment in the “second impeachment trial” of Trump after (and
despite) the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Capitol_attack&quot;&gt;events of January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;. His understanding of the rules and procedures of the
Senate were unparalleled. His realization that the electorate will blame the party in power for
losses, even if they were caused due to a filibuster from the minority was genius and the key to
most policy that did not go through the American system whenever the president is a
Democrat. This article delves into the “McConnell” psyche by talking to people who worked
alongside him and got a chance to look at how he makes decisions. The most memorable quote about
McConnell, unfortunately, is one that shows a total lack of policy-making principles:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;He [McConnell] never had any core principles. He just wants to be something. He doesn’t want to
do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Some policies that are included in this such as limits on for-profit education institutions are worth adopting in nearly every economy that wants to improve education opportunities for their citizenry. — &lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/monthly-recommendations-2021-12-something-else.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Notes and Review - Meditations on First Philosophy (Descartes)</title>
   <link href="/2021/12/26/meditations-first-philosophy-review"/>
   <updated>2021-12-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/12/26/meditations-first-philosophy-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Descartes has a gift for reasoning that I will not attempt to summarize in the few paragraphs of
this review. Descartes’ essay is worth reading if you have ever wondered about the philosophy behind
his saying “I think, therefore I am.” It is worth reading if you have a few hours to yourself and
you want to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;. It is challenging, and some of the philosophy went over my head. Despite that,
I got a basic understanding of what he was trying to do. He attempts to reason from scratch to prove
the existence of the “soul” and of “God,” for he believes that if he is able to prove their
existence, then even the most irreligious person would follow his reasoning and become religious. I
was not completely convinced by his logic in this regard, with regard to his &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; of God’s
existence. But I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; convinced about the reasoning behind his quote connecting doubting, thinking
and existence&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In this review, I have explained both Descartes’ lines of reasoning and the
doubts that arose within me when I followed these lines “without prejudice”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;descartes-reasoning&quot;&gt;Descartes’ Reasoning&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;doubt-and-denial&quot;&gt;Doubt and Denial&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, Descartes tells us to do something &lt;em&gt;apparently&lt;/em&gt; elementary: Deny anything that might have
even a shadow of doubt associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For e.g., Is your body your own? Let’s go down this rabbit hole just as Descartes tells us to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you’re asleep, you might dream yourself to be inhabiting another body&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you’re dreaming, the dream appears as real to you as reality does when you’re awake&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your mind thinks that your body is your own&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your mind thinks that the body you inhabit when you dream is &lt;strong&gt;also&lt;/strong&gt; your own&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another mind could think that your body is its own when that mind is dreaming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hence, your body &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; belong to another mind!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There! That’s a shadow of doubt. So, deny the original question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Is your body your own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; No; for there is some doubt whether my mind is the only thing that owns it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds ridiculous; but according to Descartes, this is how philosophy should be done. We must
start with nothing and reason to something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-mind-exists-i-exist&quot;&gt;My Mind Exists. I Exist.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the above example, it is clear that your body is not your own. What about your mind? Here,
Descartes makes his first major claim. Your mind &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; your own as it produces thoughts. A thought
can exist separate from the mind that produced it. And thus, that is what I am: &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am a thinking
thing, with a mind of my own, that I use to produce thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; I am. But what about my existence? For it is quite obvious, that I could be
&lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; but not exist. (&lt;strong&gt;E.g.:&lt;/strong&gt; I know what a building with 1000 floors is. But that building
does not exist. So, I should prove the existence of that building separately.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, do &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; exist? &lt;strong&gt;Yes!&lt;/strong&gt; Rejoice! I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; exist because it was &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; who thought and judged
my existence. To produce a thought, there &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be a thinking thing that produced it and that
thinking thing is &lt;em&gt;me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;god-exists&quot;&gt;God Exists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us accept the following axioms&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A thing that is not perfect can’t produce a thing that is perfect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Something cannot come into being from nothing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, look into yourself, and follow the following line of reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have the idea of God: a perfect, infinite being&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am not perfect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am finite&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thus, my mind, a thinking thing, can’t produce the thought of a perfect and infinite being for it
is neither perfect nor infinite&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hence, this thought must have been placed into my mind by a being that is perfect and infinite&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I choose to call this being God&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God Exists!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there you have it. That’s the line Descartes takes to prove his hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-doubts&quot;&gt;My Doubts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said in the introduction, I was not convinced by the author’s reasoning. Here are some of the
doubts that entered my head as I read this essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-nature-of-thoughts&quot;&gt;The Nature of Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me go back to something that a reader might question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To produce a thought, there &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be a thinking thing that produced it and that thinking thing is
&lt;em&gt;me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Descartes says the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Something cannot come into being from nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said before that Descartes wants to start from scratch. And yet, when I made the above statement
to explain Descartes’ reasoning and when Descartes said something similar, I am accepting that to be
true.  Where did this “thought” come from? Or, more simply,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who produced the thought “a thought can’t exist until a thinking thing produces it” in my mind?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the axiom&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that Descartes relies on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gods-existence-hinges-on-a-definition&quot;&gt;God’s Existence Hinges On A Definition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above reasoning the whole argument hinges on the fact that the thought inside us about God is
that &lt;strong&gt;He is perfect and infinite&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if the thought inside us is that “God exists, but has flaws”? Well, you see where this is
going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a cheeky way out of this conundrum: Simply accept Descartes’ definition of God. This is a
reasonable way to understand philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove the existence of something, one must begin with a definition of that thing. And if we are
to follow Descartes’ reasoning, then we should accept his definition too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;omissions-from-this-review&quot;&gt;Omissions from this review&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have omitted some of the things from this essay that I found to be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unconvincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;god-exists-approach-2&quot;&gt;God Exists, Approach 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 5, Descartes considers the question about whether God exists once again and “proves” this
using another approach. But the second approach contradicts some assumptions I made to understand
the original approach. I can’t bring myself to reject the assumptions I made for the first proof and
engage with the second proof, which asks me to assume the opposite thing. A thing and the opposite
of that thing can’t both be true at the same time, and hence, only the proof that involves one of
those things can be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly, the author says that God exists because I &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; him as clearly and distinctly as I
understand that a Triangle exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have 2 objections to this line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, to justify Descartes’ original line of reasoning, I started with the idea that I don’t
understand anything and don’t accept any thing’s existence unless proven. So, in that frame of mind,
I can’t really start from the idea that a Triangle exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; think that I understand God “clearly and distinctly.” In fact, it is most
unclear to me what God would look like or is capable of, unlike a Triangle which I understand much
better: I know that it has three sides, I know that the sum of two sides is more than the third, I
know that the sum of all angles will be 180 degrees, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this approach was even less appealing to me than the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;errors-in-judgment&quot;&gt;Errors in Judgment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was another place where there were too many circular reasoning steps to justify including it in
the review. He starts with the question,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why do I commit errors in judgment, when I accept that God, who is perfect and infinite, created me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this, he has a simple solution: I am incomplete and imperfect. So, I simply can’t understand the
answer to my question even if it were presented to me. So, I should &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; not bother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After giving this answer, he goes on to provide some suggestions for how we might avoid errors in
judgment and these are positively insane:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refrain from making a judgment about anything that is not clearly and precisely understood by the
intellect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Withhold judgment on anything whose truth is unknown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/dwkEgKEyBIo&quot;&gt;That is no way to live!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;proving-that-god-is-perfect-and-infinite&quot;&gt;Proving that God is Perfect and Infinite&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descartes makes (what I can only decode as) a halfhearted attempt to prove that God is perfect and
infinite. He says that while it is possible for me, a finite being, to be created by someone who is
only marginally more finite than me, it is not the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there are so many things on Earth and there is the Earth itself and so on. So, everyone and
everything’s cause of existence is necessarily infinite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not convinced by that argument, neither was I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing he says to prove it is, “the idea of God [as a perfect and infinite being] is innate
within me.” Clearly, this statement is even less useful than the previous one. A child that hasn’t
been initiated into the ways of religion and common thoughts about God does not have this idea
innate within them; it is society and the child’s observation of society that gives rise to this
idea inside her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dreams-vs-reality-resolved&quot;&gt;Dreams vs. Reality, resolved&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 6 of the book, Descartes tries to resolve the split between dreaming and
reality. However, I did not understand this meditation at all. He pieces together several arguments
from his previous meditations and proves it &lt;em&gt;somehow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What about thinking? Here I make my discovery: thought exists; it alone cannot be separated from
me. I am; I exist—this is certain. But for how long? For as long as I am thinking; for perhaps it
could also come to pass that if I were to cease all thinking I would then utterly cease to exist.
At this time I admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am therefore precisely nothing but a
thinking thing; that is, a mind, or intellect, or understanding, or reason—words of whose meanings I
was previously ignorant. Yet I am a true thing and am truly existing; but what kind of thing? I have
said it already: a thinking thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--quoteend--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But what then am I? A thing that thinks. What is that? A thing that doubts, understands, affirms,
denies, wills, refuses, and that also imagines and senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--quoteend--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, as to my parents, even if everything that I ever believed about them were true, still it is
certainly not they who preserve me; nor is it they who in any way brought me into being, insofar as
I am a thinking thing.  Rather, they merely placed certain dispositions in the matter which I judged
to contain me, that is, a mind, which now is the only thing I take myself to be. And thus there can
be no difficulty here concerning my parents. Indeed I have no choice but to conclude that the mere
fact of my existing and of there being in me an idea of a most perfect being, that is, God,
demonstrates most evidently that God too exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--quoteend--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I perceive that the power of willing, which I got from God, is not, taken by itself, the cause of my
errors, for it is most ample as well as perfect in its kind. Nor is my power of understanding the
cause of my errors. For since I got my power of understanding from God, whatever I understand I
doubtless understand rightly, and it is impossible for me to be deceived in this. What then is the
source of my errors? They are owing simply to the fact that, since the will extends further than the
intellect, I do not contain the will within the same boundaries; rather, I also extend it to things
I do not understand. Because the will is indifferent in regard to such matters, it easily turns away
from the true and the good; and in this way I am deceived and I sin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--quoteend--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, as far as God is concerned, if I were not overwhelmed by prejudices and if the images of
sensible things were not besieging my thought from all directions, I would certainly acknowledge
nothing sooner or more easily than him. For what, in and of itself, is more manifest than that a
supreme being exists, that is, that God, to whose essence alone existence belongs, exists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The full quote is “I doubt, therefore I think; I think, therefore I am.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Descartes counsels the reader early in the essay that they should read ahead only if they are willing to put their prejudices aside and meditate with him on the subject at hand. He also says “Discerning men are few and far between,” which was probably the only light, humorous line in all of the 77 pages. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I am using “axiom” here in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/axiom&quot;&gt;its dictionary sense&lt;/a&gt;. Namely, “a statement accepted as true as the basis for argument or inference.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>India's National Monetization Pipeline</title>
   <link href="/2021/12/19/india-national-monetization-pipeline"/>
   <updated>2021-12-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/12/19/india-national-monetization-pipeline</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The National Monetisation Pipeline was a policy announced by the BJP government in India in
August 2021. This policy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/what-is-asset-monetisation-know-about-governments-plan-to-raise-6-lakh-crore-1629810047-1&quot;&gt;was not widely covered&lt;/a&gt; in any of the national newspapers, and there were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/india-aims-to-raise-81-billion-by-leasing-infrastructure-assets&quot;&gt;no
policy analyses&lt;/a&gt; that went deeper than the headline numbers highlighted by the government. While some
articles started coming out in September with more details about the government’s expectations, I
couldn’t find any criticism of the government’s approach. A tired &lt;a href=&quot;https://theprint.in/opinion/what-is-the-best-asset-monetisation-plan-modi-govt-can-learn-important-lessons-from-australia/721622/&quot;&gt;comparison to Australia’s asset
monetisation plan&lt;/a&gt; was everywhere, but this did nothing but scratch the surface. (The same comparison
was repeated in multiple publications including The Print and India Today.) This post is a summary
of my understanding of the policy after reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/20210927-asset-monetisation-the-big-push-1853498-2021-09-17&quot;&gt;some detailed coverage&lt;/a&gt; in the September 27, 2021
issue of the India Today magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is broken up into three sections: What, Why and How. I have included footnotes with
sources for all the figures that are mentioned in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what&quot;&gt;What?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2021-08/Vol_2_NATIONAL_MONETISATION_PIPELINE_23_Aug_2021.pdf&quot;&gt;National Monetization Pipeline (NMP)&lt;/a&gt; was unveiled by the government in the last week of
August 2021. It is a policy that aims to raise Rs. 6 lakh crores&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; over the 4 years between 2021
and 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pipeline plans to put up existing, operational government-owned assets for monetisation. Private
companies can get “revenue rights” to these assets, which will enable them to enhance them (such as
widening operational roads) and provide new services using them (such as new trains on existing
railway tracks). The ownership of the assets will remain with the government. And when the tenure of
monetisation ends, revenue rights will revert to the government. In effect, the government is
leasing out its assets to private players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question for private players who are considering any investment is clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can they use the asset to generate enough revenue to recoup the capital that they invest?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If they can recoup the capital, can they make a profit on the asset in the limited time for which
they will hold the revenue rights?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;governments-expectations&quot;&gt;Government’s expectations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For assets that are monetised, the government expects the following three things from the private
sector entity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upfront capital&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A share of revenue generated from the asset during the period of monetisation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Investment commitment towards the monetised asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government expects the private player to increase efficiency, enhance the quality of service,
and increase userbase through service improvements, so that they can charge enough to make money
despite having to pay a share of their revenue back to the government. In reality, most private
players that will monetise an asset will probably use all three strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;connection-to-national-infrastructure-pipeline-nip&quot;&gt;Connection to National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://indiainvestmentgrid.gov.in/national-infrastructure-pipeline&quot;&gt;NIP&lt;/a&gt; is the flagship policy that the Indian government unveiled on August 15, 2019 (India’s
Independency Day). This policy’s goal was to invest Rs. 100 lakh crores into infrastructure projects
in India during the period from 2019 to 2025. This policy is planned to end at the same time as the
NMP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NMP is one of the ways in which the government is raising money to invest in the NIP. (The
government’s revenues from NMP will be re-invested in “new infrastructure” that will be built as
part of NIP.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIP’s headline number was &lt;em&gt;ambitious&lt;/em&gt;. The total infrastructure investment in India in the
preceding 5 year period from 2013 to 2018 was Rs. 46.48 lakh crores, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dea.gov.in/sites/default/files/Report%20of%20the%20Task%20Force%20National%20Infrastructure%20Pipeline%20(NIP)%20-%20volume-i_1.pdf&quot;&gt;Department of
Economic Affairs (DEA)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In effect, Modi’s plan was to double infrastructure investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, I could not find any summary of how this policy is going after 2019. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dea.gov.in/sites/default/files/Report%20of%20the%20Task%20Force%20National%20Infrastructure%20Pipeline%20(NIP)%20-%20volume-i_1.pdf&quot;&gt;official
policy document&lt;/a&gt; marks several of the important Key Performance Indicators as “TBD (To Be Decided).”
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/budget-2021-national-infrastructure-pipeline-expanded-to-cover-7400-projects&quot;&gt;latest mention of this policy&lt;/a&gt; was in the Budget speech in February 2021 where new projects were
added to NIP.  It is already 2 years since the policy’s implementation period began, but there seems
to be no mention of it anywhere on Government websites or any media coverage of how much investment
has come in through this policy and whether the government is meeting its phasing goals for the
project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My read of the numbers is that the government is falling short of the capital expenditure
planned under the NIP:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;66.66%&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put this number in context, here are some headline figures for the Indian economy. All figures in
the second column are in lakh crore INR (= 1 trillion INR). The figures for government revenue and
expenditure are from the “Actual” values of 2019-20, the last year which has published “Actuals”
figures and was not affected by the Covid19 pandemic. Figures are taken from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://prsindia.org/budgets/parliament/union-budget-2021-22-analysis&quot;&gt;PRS India Union

      &lt;td&gt;Government subsidies (petrol, food, fertiliser, others)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2.62&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mospi.gov.in/documents/213904/416359//Press%20Note_31-05-20211622465609539.pdf/104c1d4e-65cd-ab8e-0ff3-79db5cefc0c2&quot;&gt;India’s 2019-20 GDP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;145&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the government’s peak yearly revenue from NMP would cover the government’s expenditure on
Education and Railways. Looking at these figures, it’s clear that the NMP is not as ambitious as the
NIP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seem to be two major reasons for this policy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public sector management of public assets is inefficient:&lt;/strong&gt; This is tacitly accepted
throughout the NMP policy document, especially in sections where the policy talks about
“unlocking value” in existing assets. The government recognizes that efficient management of
public assets is essential to the economy’s growth. However, to achieve this, the management is
outsourced to private players.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government borrowing is at a limit:&lt;/strong&gt; For the NIP, the government must raise Rs. 100 lakh crores
in the 2020-2025 period. Until now, it seems that the main method for raising this capital has
been government borrowing. (I could not find concrete figures for how much of the borrowing has
gone into NIP projects.) The debt-to-GDP ratio is just above 62.9% in 2020-21. Moreover, over the
remaining period of the NIP, until 2025, the government plans to bring this ratio down to 60%,
according to the recommendations from the 15th Finance Commission. This means that the government
has to pay back about Rs. 4.5 lakh cr.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of the oustanding liabilities to achieve their
debt-to-GDP ratio goal. So, more borrowing is not the solution to fill the gap in NIP
capital. The government sees monetizing existing assets as the only viable option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing jumped out at me after reading through the literature about both NMP and NIP. NMP’s
underlying assumption is that the private sector is better at efficiently maintaining infrastructure
compared to the public sector. So, one is forced to question the government’s wisdom in trying to
build more public infrastructure under the NIP, which will be managed by the public sector, while it
is accepting that public sector management is inefficient in the long-run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how&quot;&gt;How?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details about the implementation of this policy are completely missing from the original policy
document. Most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/india-aims-to-raise-81-billion-by-leasing-infrastructure-assets&quot;&gt;media coverage&lt;/a&gt; about the NMP simply skips covering this part, because there is
nothing to be said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the details that are missing are: what kind of rights will be part of “revenue rights,” how
much upfront capital and revenue share the government will demand for each type of asset. One has to
assume that these numbers will never be set in stone, because the private sector will expect them to
be negotiable based on their existing scale. They will also hope to get a “wholesale” discount, if
they decide to invest big in NMP. The government would not want to tie its hands during these
negotiations by publicly announcing a minimum value for any of these figures. So, the public will
probably find out about NMP projects only after the negotiations have been completed and the
government has already made a decision about these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, whether the private sector is even interested in taking over management of mismanaged
public assets, investing capital in them and trying to turn them around, is up for debate. There has
already been some criticism of the two major asset classes that are up for monetisation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roads:&lt;/strong&gt; Roads make up 27% of the expected revenue from NMP. 26,700 kms of roads that are
operational or under construction with at least 4 lanes are up for monetisation. These roads are
part of the National Highway network and the toll collection rights have been retained by the
National Highway Authority of India. The criticism of this asset class is that 4-lane roads are
already being managed efficiently by the NHAI, and that as long as toll collection rights remain
with the NHAI, it seems unlikely that private players would want to put in any unrecoverable
capital in the enhancement of this asset class. (As in the long term, NHAI will reap the benefits
of the private player’s capital investment.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Railways:&lt;/strong&gt; Railways make up a further 26% of the expected revenue from NMP. 400 railway stations
and 90 passenger train operations are up for monetisation. Currently, Konkan Railway seems to be
the only railway entity in the country which has atleast one private stakeholder involved in its
management. Given this relative lack of experience in the private sector, getting them involved
in operations through asset monetisation seems akin to throwing them into the deep-end of the
swimming pool. An approach in which entities that have experience managing operations can work
with entities that don’t have any experience in an effort to build the private sector’s
experience would be preferable. This approach would also give them a close look at the potential
for profit in Railways operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies die in the implementation phase, where ambitious projects transform into reams of paperwork
making their way through an incompetent, circuitous and intolerably slow bureaucracy. Private sector
players are unable or unwilling to invest the resources required to cut through this regulatory red
tape. The very existence of the red tape will tilt the field towards a very small number of players,
and this policy might result in an oligarchy. This concern has been raised before, and the
government seems to be willing to accept the risk of oligarchy as long as they are able to get the
capital required to enact wider benefits. In a nod towards the influence of the reigning monopolists
in India (namely, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-12/two-billionaires-are-central-to-india-s-oversized-net-zero-ambitions&quot;&gt;Ambani and Adani&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/lBXEFc0i4OE?t=913&quot;&gt;the leader of the opposition did not mention their name&lt;/a&gt; in a
press conference in which he was criticizing the NMP. Instead, he chose to refer to them indirectly
as “2 or 3 people that you already know about.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a goal of raising Rs. 0.88 lakh crore&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by April 2022 under the NMP, missing implementation
details raise questions about the government’s ability to achieve their target.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Monthly Recommendations (November 2021)</title>
   <link href="/2021/12/11/monthly-recommendations-2021-november"/>
   <updated>2021-12-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/12/11/monthly-recommendations-2021-november</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The theme for November’s list is Nature. Movies starting with Jurassic Park have tried to show
humans that Nature’s powers are wielded at the most uncomfortable times for human beings and that
there is really no consideration for &lt;em&gt;us.&lt;/em&gt; This does not stop us from wanting to change the natural
course. And this forceful change in nature’s course that we effect through our actions, our
scientific understanding of fundamentals, our engineering acumen to build &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; structures, and our
knack for planning long, complex adventures with far-fetched goals in mind is the theme of this
month’s recommendation list. It includes one article about a ship that got stuck in the Suez Canal,
a team of people who want to set a world-record and thus circle the globe 1.5 times in their
pursuit, and the story of a government’s need to do data-driven policy gone haywire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Six Days in Suez: The Inside Story of the Ship That Broke Global Trade (Chellel, Campbel, Ha)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-24/how-the-billion-dollar-ever-given-cargo-ship-got-stuck-in-the-suez-canal&quot;&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/PgCcw&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). 24 Jun, 2021&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Great investigation and very interesting notes from the people who were deeply involved in the
operation to dislodge the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Ever Given disaster was perhaps one of the most interesting news story of the past year. It
was a welcome relief from the constant grief that COVID19 stories cast on all news coverage. It
was also a problem that seemed so &lt;em&gt;tractable.&lt;/em&gt; After a year of coverage about variations in
virus genomes and vaccine efficacy, the sudden blockage of a canal because a ship got lodged in
it and blocked it seemed almost unreal. At the story’s beginning, there were very few images and
most of the coverage repeated the same few refrains. Bloomberg managed to get the first eyes on
the ground and returned some footage that showed the massive scale of the problem. Soon after,
the outlook was pessimistic enough that shipping major Maersk decided to re-route ships through
the Cape of Good Hope. The solution to the sideways ship was also surprisingly quick. Helped
along by a high tide caused by a full moon, the ship was dislodged in about a week. The backlog
was cleared in another week. The rerouted ship would take 3 weeks to travel the distance that is
covered in about 14 hours through the Suez Canal. This article is an amazing recap of the whole
incident.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not perfect, but that’s the story with all media coverage.&lt;/strong&gt; The authors don’t meet the
mark with their knowledge of the major languages in various regions. In particular, a cursory
search would have told them that a huge number of children in India study in schools where
English is the medium of education and thus, despite not being my native language, I continue to
write blog posts in English. A note about the background of the people on the bridge would have
been useful, such as the regions that they studied in or the language that they completed their
naval training in. (I am very confident that these seamen must have completed their training
from institutes in India and given their exams in English.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After climbing aboard, the two Egyptian pilots were led up to the bridge to meet the captain,
officers, and helmsmen, all of them Indian, like the rest of the crew. According to documents filed
weeks later in an Egyptian court, there was a dispute at some point about whether the ship should
enter the canal at all, given the bad weather—a debate that may have been hampered by the fact that
English was neither side’s first language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Also, I don’t see why language is an issue here. These are men trained to make snap decisions in
crisis situations such as these. Their language will not hamper their communication as there is
a set hierarchy that &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be followed anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five Oceans, Five Deeps (Taub)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/thirty-six-thousand-feet-under-the-sea&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/ET1Zz&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). 18th May, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The incredible non-fiction piece about a team of researchers and world-record setters who
traveled all 5 of the deepest points on the planet’s oceans and descended to the bottom in their
vessels. This is a story of survival, the trials that come along the way, and the importance of
world records. In all the ways that one can get their name etched into history, world records
are perhaps the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; accessible to the normal person. Of course, it’s all relative. This
particular mission required a lot of resources, and the world record was set only because the
people involved in the project could come up with that money. This article also touches on that
point. The other ways of getting into the halls of history involve politics or sports, both of
which require &lt;em&gt;atleast&lt;/em&gt; a little bit of skill that the person &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be born with. There &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt;
some who like to believe that politics is completely random because people form their opinions
well before they vote in an election and that sports is completely random because athletes can
be good if they are trained early and relentlessly. I am not in both those camps yet and firmly
believe that something innate is a requirement; however small that might be, there’s something
that’s required. To someone who believes that, setting “one of the last meaningful records”
would definitely seem to be worth the hefty price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black, No Sugar. (Gopnik)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/27/the-war-on-coffee&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/pUeiE&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). 27th April, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Coffee is everywhere and it’s the most common drink that one finds in the newest of places.
There is a lot of fuss over the taste of coffee; I don’t have a taste palette refined enough to
understand even 10% of the conversations about coffee among connoisseurs. But the history of
coffee is a fascinating topic to me because it tracks the emergence and spread of a caffeine
delivery system. Gopnik chronicles the books about the corrective history of coffee that
questions coffee drinkers around the world about the moral costs of their constant consumption,
and also questions the basis of their consumption itself; the relation between caffeine and
productivity may have been &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; overstated by the coffee lobby inside political
institutions, making it a phenomenally easy commodity to trade. Gopnik uncovers such tricky
truths in his piece.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pandemic Made Cities Quieter, But Not Less Stressful (Sullivan)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2021-covid-city-noise/?srnd=businessweek-v2&quot;&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/II4Se&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). 2nd September, 2021&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Sound is everywhere but we barely notice it in most situations. When we do notice it, it is with
either the at most pleasure or the vilest displeasure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb33zXpEgCc&quot;&gt;The Vox, Explained episode about Music&lt;/a&gt; is
also a great reminder of this core role that sound (noise and music) plays in our lives. With
the reduction of some city noises over the past year, as economies came to a screeching halt,
other noises have become prominent. The uncomfortable silence in a city is comparable to the
uncomfortable silence inside your office, where you can here your own voice clearly, for there
is no other &lt;em&gt;background noise.&lt;/em&gt; This is an article about how soundscapes and well-designed
cities might be the way to solving the &lt;em&gt;noisy city&lt;/em&gt; problem, once-and-for-all. If we would want
to make the city less noisy is another question altogether. I am not yet convinced that we need
to live in a relatively silent city to be less stressed. To me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0RDIT5-bng&quot;&gt;the noise that runs through
cities&lt;/a&gt; is the key to separate them from the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India’s Air Pollution Mitigation Strategy Needs More Direction (Shah)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/environment/indias-air-pollution-mitigation-strategy-needs-more-direction&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/i5KsS&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;). 7th June, 2021&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Government policies take a lot of time to be drafted and even when they become bills they are
huge documents without a straightforward explanation of their goals. This is clearly &lt;strong&gt;hard;&lt;/strong&gt; I
concede that it might &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; be impossible: How do you design a straightforward system for
hundreds of millions of people where even a corner case that occurs 0.1% of the time will affect
the lives of 100,000 people?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, the dense regulatory framework benefits corporations that have the revenue to pay
lawyers to parse through policies and find ways to use them to their advantage. This article
views the problem of policy making from the government’s side: &lt;strong&gt;Why does the government not make
a policy to reduce pollution in India’s metro areas?&lt;/strong&gt; The government is criticized for taking
steps which are not backed by “real numbers.” To get these real numbers, the government
commissions studies and forms committees.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This article rails against such actions; and specifically, again “source apportionment studies,”
which (presumably) attribute the existing pollution to various sources and try to apportion
blame to each source. The results of such studies are used as the basis of “data-driven policy.”
However, as the author demonstrates, these studies have &lt;strong&gt;not discovered anything useful or new
in the 15 years between 2001 and 2017&lt;/strong&gt;. Institutions like IIT Madras and IIT Kanpur are involved
in the conduction of these studies; I know that studies like these are a major source of revenue
and research papers for the academics at these institutions. Publishing at a high rate is one of
the assured paths to great publicity for academics; and thus, the incentive structures line up
perfectly between governments and academics. These studies deliver no value to the
government. &lt;strong&gt;So, the incentive structure to reduce air pollution? Well, it is dysfunctional.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Monthly Recommendations (October 2021)</title>
   <link href="/2021/11/02/monthly-recommendations-2021-october"/>
   <updated>2021-11-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/11/02/monthly-recommendations-2021-october</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have tried to stay away from COVID-19 on this blog. Most people are writing nearly constantly
about it and I don’t have many original takes on this topic. But this month, I reverted back to a
way-of-life that was typical for me before the pandemic began. I traveled to another city to meet
relatives; I went on a vacation; I traveled to some places in the city that I am in; I went out to
restaurants and dined-in. These experiences signal a return to normalcy which seemed unlikely in
March 2020, 18 months ago. These experiences also shined light on a change within myself: I have
gotten used to &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; being among strangers. Going back to a previous lifestyle, seeing and listening
to strangers again has been an interesting return to normal. (I am glad that the “new normal” was
transient.) So, this month’s theme is &lt;strong&gt;a receding pandemic.&lt;/strong&gt; I look back at some of the articles
which I read at various milestones during the pandemic, starting from the beginning of the pandemic
in Japan last year, through the emergence of the vaccines, and right up to the most recent article
about the long-term effects of this crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existential Inconvenience (Dyer)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/the-existential-inconvenience-of-coronavirus&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.md/GtiGt&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 23 March, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This article was written right when the pandemic was beginning. Realizations like “knowing that
you will not be able to do something is better than knowing that it is still possible but
unlikely” seem obvious. But having them articulated at you is also clarifying. I am not sure why
that is the case. (I am trying to figure that one out still.) The author calls these “existential
inconveniences,” I think that’s an apt name. They don’t really rise up to the level of problems
(For e.g., I could not see Bob Dylan perform live in Japan in April 2020 because his show got
canceled.) but they are at least inconveniences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memoranda (Rozzo)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/war-poems-of-the-pandemic&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.md/BdMoB&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 18th May, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;War analogies are morose. But they are also effective because every war has an enemy, and all
wars &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/08/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-end-of-the-war-in-afghanistan/&quot;&gt;end&lt;/a&gt;, even the ones that seem to drag on forever. These two crutches are required for
prolonged belief in the proverbial “light at the end of the tunnel.” This article is a set of
poems written by a soldier who arrived in New York during the worst art of the pandemic
there. The soldier (who remains anonymous) was able to write poetry to capture the moment and
escape from it himself. The poetry is simple and beautiful; at times, it simply restates
facts. But I am not sure I would be able to write something this good when I need to focus on
crisis management; and this is the main reason I am recommending this piece. It’s a reminder
about what’s possible when one is in an unprecedented situation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weaponizing Uncertainty in COVID-19 Lab Leak Theory (Rogers)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-lab-leak-theory-weaponized-uncertainty/&quot;&gt;Wired Magazine&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.md/Wdx9X&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 20th May, 2021&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Declassified-Assessment-on-COVID-19-Origins.pdf&quot;&gt;a recent report&lt;/a&gt; from the US intelligence community about the origins of COVID-19. (I
have not read the full report; I have read the first few pages and reporting about it.) Indulge
me and pretend that new evidence matters. Indulge me further and pretend that new evidence has
the power to change already formed beliefs/opinions/facts. The report can be used to prove any
opinion that the reader has already arrived at. For e.g., for those who &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; that China is
not to blame for the disastrous handling of the pandemic in US, Europe, and UK, they can go to
this line:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Area of Broad Agreement: Virus not developed as biological weapon; Virus not genetically
engineered&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;And for those who want to blame China, they can use this line:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;China’s cooperation most likely would be needed to reach a conclusive assessment of the origins
of COVID-19.  Beijing, however, continues to hinder the global investigation, resist sharing
information, and blame other countries, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Even though the report goes on to say that “Beijing’s lack of cooperation on origins not
diagnostic of either hypothesis,” this second point is mostly glossed over in second-hand
reporting of this report. It says that the report does not explicitly blames China for the virus,
but it does blame China for not sharing enough information. The retort that everyone is familiar
with rises: “If they don’t have anything to hide, why are they not sharing all the information
that they have?”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I will not pretend to have any answer. I am fairly certain that there &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; no answer. Even if
there is one, this answer will not be found. So, what is the point of all this coverage of the
virus’ origins? Biden needs to win the mid-terms; Europe needs a scapegoat for their disastrous
handling of the pandemic; Most other countries have upcoming democratic elections where voters
will demand to know why their government failed where China succeeded. This take is clearly
cynical; and this article supports this take from the point of view of weaponized uncertainty:
Not being able to find something casts suspicion on the institution which most likely has the
&lt;em&gt;coveted&lt;/em&gt; evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderna’s Next Act Is Using mRNA vs. Flu, Zika, HIV, and Cancer (Langreth)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-07-14/moderna-mrna-targets-hiv-cancer-flu-zika-after-covid-vaccine&quot;&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.md/Az4SO&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 14th July, 2021&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;How did we get a vaccine for the coronavirus so soon? The strategy of using a vaccine as the
path out of COVID-19 was considered reckless and foolhardy in March 2020. “Vaccines take years to
make. The earliest period of time in which we have been able to develop safe vaccines in the past
was 4 years.” Policy makers had different reactions to these warnings from vaccine
scientists. Vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer and Moderna stayed quiet and worked on finding the
vaccine. The announcements in November 2020 about the 90+% efficacy that vaccines had shown in
Phase 3 clinical trials was perhaps the best piece of news in the past year. This article
explains why the mRNA approach to vaccines is modular and configurable, features which are at the
core of scalability in software, and apparently also in vaccine development. This article
elaborates on how mRNA could turn into the ticket out of future pandemics and existing incurable
diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re Losing Our Humanity, and the Pandemic Is To Blame (Smith)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/were-losing-our-humanity-and-the-pandemic-is-to-blame&quot;&gt;ProPublica&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.md/v8W8L&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 7th October, 2021&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The pandemic has been the comfortable scapegoat for a lot of uncomfortable truths that have come
to light in the past few months. Particularly, about “losing humanity,” I wonder if the changes
we have seen in behaviors over the past 1.5 years were just latent tendencies which were
triggered by the pandemic. The ongoing pandemic is a mix of three things: a once-in-a-lifetime
crisis, a conspiracy theory breeding ground, and an event that increases fervor about already
held beliefs. The period of lockdowns in 2020 was also the first time in my lifetime where I had
limited contact with strangers for that long a period of time. This has made returning to the
world and interacting with strangers again a shocking experience. Recently, returning from a
vacation, I found that many of the strangers around me were in an anxious and nervous state which
made them take actions which lacked empathy and considerateness. This was not something that I
was noticing for the first time; nevertheless it hit me like a rock wall and left me confused for
a few days. For that feeling of confusion, I am &lt;strong&gt;certain&lt;/strong&gt; that the pandemic &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Climate Change Fever, Late 2021 Edition</title>
   <link href="/2021/10/30/climate-change-fever"/>
   <updated>2021-10-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/10/30/climate-change-fever</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t caught the climate change fever yet, you almost certainly &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; catch it in the next
few weeks. Even a cursory glance of the news will familiarize you with &lt;a href=&quot;https://ukcop26.org/&quot;&gt;COP26&lt;/a&gt;. As the climate
conference approaches, Western publications have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/green-cop26-climate-summit&quot;&gt;gone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/climate/nyt-climate-newsletter-cop26.html&quot;&gt;all-in&lt;/a&gt; and bet that the conference will
generate a large amount of news. They are right about this, the conference is definitely going to be
a hotbed of some &lt;em&gt;stunning&lt;/em&gt; news stories. Some countries might announce new targets, others might go
back on their existing targets or not commit to anything new, etc. Every change in policy will be
followed extremely closely and dissected and analyzed from every possible angle. Only one question
will remain unanswered: &lt;strong&gt;What is the point of all this hoopla?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change science and climate change activism are no longer distinct. Scientists and activists
used to occupy different positions in the discourse, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slowboring.com/&quot;&gt;Matt Yglesias&lt;/a&gt; has pointed out
before. Science is about trade-offs, because very few things come at 0 or near-0 costs. Activism is
about convincing other people to share your beliefs and implement your proposals, and thus,
selecting evidence that will help you achieve that end and ignoring evidence that will hurt your
ability to achieve your goals is ethically acceptable to an activist.  Returning to a Matt Yglesias
quote,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; “If you are an activist and you are admitting that there are trade-offs to your
proposals, then you are doing activism wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the topic of climate change, scientists often speak like activists, issuing dire
warnings about the devastating effects of a warming planet. Activists speak like scientists, armed
with information that has become &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/climate-change-data-green/&quot;&gt;ridiculously easy to access and easier still to understand&lt;/a&gt;, as it
has been boiled down to a few numbers. Never mind if the numbers actually tell the story that a
naive interpretation of them would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politicians occupy a sticky position in this discourse. Their &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt; is to reflect the majority’s
thoughts back at their voterbase. On an issue such as this one, it is nearly impossible to poll the
right number of people and find out what the majority thinks. This has crippled the political
response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aoc&quot;&gt;activists&lt;/a&gt; have become politicians but have not changed their role as their constituencies are
so “in the bag” that what they say or do is completely immaterial. AOC’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/FGVW9vJ773k&quot;&gt;recent questioning&lt;/a&gt; of
executives from big oil was a good instance of toxic, futile posturing. I believe that smart,
sarcastic coverage of Big Oil has always hit the mark in convincing people of the shady roles that
Big Oil and their lobbyists play in the lives of the citizenry and how they are warping (education,
energy and economy) policy. Laura Grey’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/-VojHT92LGI&quot;&gt;segment&lt;/a&gt; from the show, The Opposition with Jordan Klepper,
is a good example of such coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/28/climate-summit-agenda-half-baked-biden-517462&quot;&gt;opposition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; from members of their own party in countries like America,
politicians have ended up facing the reality that is clear to neutral observers: The economy is
deeply tied to the technologies which the climate change activists say must be eradicated and the
economy is one thing that has real impact on people’s lives and swings elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media has undoubtedly taken a side. Articles about how COP26 is the place where most problems
will be solved are commonplace. “The importance of this summit cannot be overstated,” “It is high
time that the leaders of the world get together and do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; about this &lt;em&gt;existential
threat.&lt;/em&gt;,” “Rich nations have a responsibility to the global poor,” “Poor nations that continue to
pollute must be penalized by rich nations,” and so on. The unending contradictions are impossible to
parse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; specific talking point that I want to delve into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;who-is-the-biggest-polluter&quot;&gt;Who Is The Biggest Polluter?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most publications and activists point at India and China as the biggest polluters. This is an
intentional jibe and a mischaracterization of the issue at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the table of emissions and populations, sorted by annual emissions. (A note about
abbreviations can be found in the footnotes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-ghg-emissions?tab=chart&amp;amp;country=USA~GBR~CHN~IND~JPN&quot;&gt;Annual GHG emissions&lt;/a&gt; (billion tonnes)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL&quot;&gt;Population&lt;/a&gt; (billions)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-emissions-per-capita?tab=chart&amp;amp;country=USA~GBR~CHN~IND~JPN&quot;&gt;GHG emissions per capita&lt;/a&gt; (tonnes)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10.17&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.402&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;9.22&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;America&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5.28&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.329&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;20.20&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;India&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2.62&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.380&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2.38&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Japan&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.11&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.125&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;11.59&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;England&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.369&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.067&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;9.20&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, China appears to be the largest polluter. Sorting this table by per-capita emissions tells a
different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-ghg-emissions?tab=chart&amp;amp;country=USA~GBR~CHN~IND~JPN&quot;&gt;Annual GHG emissions&lt;/a&gt; (billion tonnes)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL&quot;&gt;Population&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-emissions-per-capita?tab=chart&amp;amp;country=USA~GBR~CHN~IND~JPN&quot;&gt;GHG emissions per capita&lt;/a&gt; (tonnes)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;America&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5.28&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.329&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;20.20&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Japan&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.11&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.125&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;11.59&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;China&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10.17&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.402&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;9.22&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;England&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.369&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.067&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;9.20&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;India&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2.62&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.380&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2.38&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both America and Japan are far bigger polluters, per resident of their nations. Looking at
per-capita emissions seems like the obvious method for assigning blame because the number of people
in a country is the only constant which can’t be changed, in the lack of drastic changes like a
war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high GHG emissions are due to the level of advancement of these countries, which entitles them
to uninterrupted electricity, cheap gasoline, higher levels of disposable income leading to far more
air travel, etc. These advancements are objectively good things for the populations of these
countries and not something to be looked at grudgingly or that countries should be penalized
for. So, hiding behind the “Annual GHG emissions” number is a dodge from the media. They
recognize the failure of the US and Japan to take any action; and they channel this recognition into
an effort to reassign blame to China, a poorly understood nation without the power of a persuasive
English media ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the failure of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22408556/save-planet-shrink-economy-degrowth&quot;&gt;degrowth movement&lt;/a&gt; (even in the most liberal parts of the world) has shown, the
solution that holds sway among populations is not one which involves a compromises of any kind. So,
any rhetoric about how “human beings have hurt the planet and its time we suffer to redeem
ourselves” is useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Griffith’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2020/8/27/21403184/saul-griffith-ezra-klein-show-solve-climate-change-green-new-deal-rewiring-america&quot;&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; is a solution that involves retaining the same level of comfort but changing the
energy sources to ones that have lower emissions for producing the same amount of energy. But as
Griffith admits, the problem is not one of engineering, it is one of &lt;strong&gt;political will.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as you look at the coverage of the COP26 summit, bear in mind that the summit exists only to
convince people in the speakers’ countries that &lt;em&gt;their country is doing enough&lt;/em&gt; and that the &lt;em&gt;cause
of inaction is abroad.&lt;/em&gt; The likelihood of any major treaty emerging from this summit is low,
especially given that the world’s largest polluters are stuck in political limbo with &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/-Obru_ndWRw&quot;&gt;a polarized
voter base&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a lot of “symbolic” announcements&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and these will be celebrated in lieu of the
&lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; action that this conference was supposed to coerce out of nations. The blame-game &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/business/energy-environment/china-coal-climate.html&quot;&gt;against
China&lt;/a&gt; and India’s refusal to commit to any new net-zero goals will continue unabated.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The American political system is &lt;em&gt;strange&lt;/em&gt;. It has three branches; the Executive, Congress and the
Judiciary. Judges within the judiciary are appointed by the Executive with approval from
Congress. The President is the highest official in the Executive branch and elected directly by the
people. And all members of Congress are also directly elected. All the lawmaking power lies with
Congress and it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/upshot/medicaid-expansion-democrats-obamacare.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; very hard to repeal laws&lt;/a&gt; which have already been enacted. On the
other hand, the Executive branch is a fickle-minded body where the current President’s whims and
fancies are the primary deciding force. Treaties are signed by the Executive branch. And wars begin
and end at the Executive branch’s will. This makes America an unreliable republic to have any kind
of long-term agreement with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democracies crave &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/cIYfiRyPi3o?t=137&quot;&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;. Economies are the most important things that governments manage, and
long-term economic policy can be drafted only when one’s allies are clearly known and their behavior
can be reliably anticipated or they can be trusted to give sufficient warning of major policy
changes. There are more problems that governments generally want to solve like providing the right
amount of nutrition to citizens and enabling access to modern healthcare, emanating from Research
and Development efforts in allied countries. All these things hinge upon a reliable ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US-UK relationship is &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/policy-history/&quot;&gt;special&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This in turn makes sudden policy changes such as Brexit in
UK &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/22/us-uk-special-relationship-faces-new-challenges-despite-signs-of-healing&quot;&gt;difficult&lt;/a&gt; to navigate for the allied country. Similarly, the abrupt American exit from
Afghanistan left Britain in a strange spot. They discovered that refugees from the war-torn country
were going to come to various countries in Europe and might soon be eligible to travel to and work
on British soil. This puts the policies that both countries have for their own countries in
jeopardy, as these sudden excess/deficient flows of goods and people will drive a wedge through
established policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Executive branch signs treaties which the Executive branch is free to leave. The reversal is
&lt;em&gt;not at all&lt;/em&gt; stunning, and in fact, is the obvious solution to an ideological disagreement. If your
predecessor entered a deal that you believe is not a good one, &lt;strong&gt;just leave.&lt;/strong&gt; Being in the powerful
position of being the largest economy and a leader among English-speaking nations (which covers most
of the world, due to British colonial history), the US seldom has to worry about &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt; impacts
inside America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stress the word &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt; here because the Media coverage will insist on the “stunning policy
reversals,” even though a self-interested actor (such as a politician) will think of this reversal
as the obvious step. Journalists seem to have a soft-spot for symbolic moves. I am incensed by this
false emphasis on “symbols” within policy, where the final policy that gets enacted is what matters,
and everything else is &lt;em&gt;just fluff.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Sidenote:&lt;/em&gt; The US government is good at creating fluff: Biden
managed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://morningconsult.com/2021/04/27/biden-100-days-global-views-america/&quot;&gt;improve his approval ratings&lt;/a&gt; abroad within just 3 months of taking office. This approval
rating abroad started falling later in his presidency though. And the global media is exceptional at
consuming fluff, both of the self-aggrandizing sort and otherwise.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama entered the Iran Nuclear Deal and the Paris Climate Accords in 2015. Both of these were touted
to be a big deal&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; at the time and for several years after the fact. Trump took office and
swiftly moved to get out of both deals. He gave various reasons for his departure. From the point of
view of other parties to this treaty, the reasons are immaterial and no amount of ridiculing
Trump&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or the Republican Party is of any real use. The consequential decision had already been
made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, going further in from foreign policy to America’s domestic stance on issues, Biden’s famous
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/what-did-president-biden-e2-80-99s-day-one-executive-orders-achieve/ar-BB1cVZov&quot;&gt;“executive order” purge&lt;/a&gt; on his first day in office was another symbolic move that served to confirm
America’s unreliable status as a “partner” in anything. I was surprised that the Biden
administration made a big deal about directly reversing 9 Trump executive orders; this kind of
&lt;em&gt;stunning&lt;/em&gt; policy reversal is the last thing other partners want to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a falling approval rating &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/?ex_cid=rrpromo&quot;&gt;at home&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://morningconsult.com/form/global-leader-approval/#section-49&quot;&gt;abroad&lt;/a&gt; and an inability to build a consensus for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-climate-plan-cut-build-back-better/&quot;&gt;domestic
policy&lt;/a&gt;, the Biden administration has failed at their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/dipnote-u-s-department-of-state-official-blog/america-is-back-president-biden-outlines-his-vision-for-u-s-foreign-policy/&quot;&gt;“America is Back”&lt;/a&gt; campaign. Facing a grueling
mid-term election in just 1 year, in which they &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/&quot;&gt;are projected&lt;/a&gt; to lose control of Congress, it is
questionable that any significant policy will be enacted in Biden’s remaining presidential term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is in no way a hindrance for people that want to see America do something big: the
Judiciary branch’s top body, the Supreme Court, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/03/us/politics/supreme-court-new-term.html&quot;&gt;has just begun&lt;/a&gt; a term with some very big cases
scheduled. And Congress is probing both Facebook and Google for (what I approximate to) &lt;em&gt;shady
monopolistic business-running behavior.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“The United States has no closer ally than the United Kingdom, and British foreign policy emphasizes close coordination with the United States.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I can not comprehend why a climate agreement where countries set non-binding targets which they can choose not to adhere to is a big deal. But hey, your local journalist says its a big deal and so it is. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Colbert’s coverage of Trump was vitriolic and unwatchable during most of this period. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Monthly Recommendations (September 2021)</title>
   <link href="/2021/09/30/monthly-recommendations-2021-september"/>
   <updated>2021-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/09/30/monthly-recommendations-2021-september</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month’s theme is &lt;strong&gt;the Chinese state.&lt;/strong&gt; Lately, there has been a lot of news out of China. As Xi
Jinping guides the China story towards the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/new-chart-shows-china-gdp-could-overtake-us-sooner-as-covid-took-its-toll.html&quot;&gt;inevitable conclusion&lt;/a&gt; of overtaking the US economy in
size, he has started announcing reforms that look unthinkable to many but deal with the key
underlying issues in late-stage capitalism. Rising tuition fees and the unsustainable costs of
tutoring are a key issue in India. Coaching classes that train students for the entrance exams of
leading engineering and medical colleges cost about INR 50,000 per annum, which is a third of the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indias-per-capita-income-to-drop-by-5-4-in-fy21-report/articleshow/76532582.cms&quot;&gt;annual per-capita income of India&lt;/a&gt;. China’s crackdown to make these coaching classes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-25/china-to-overhaul-private-education-sector-hijacked-by-capital&quot;&gt;non-profits&lt;/a&gt; is
the most refreshing reform that I have seen imposed on this industry in the past decade. Another
industry that has been on the rise in India is online gaming and online gambling. The rise of this
industry has made &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sentinelassam.com/north-east-india-news/assam-news/online-gaming-of-minor-leads-woman-to-lose-rs-19-lakh-in-sivsagar-assam-555605&quot;&gt;strange&lt;/a&gt; cases unusually frequent. (These cases remain the exception and not the
norm.) China’s recent regulation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/china-limits-minors-to-just-three-hours-of-online-gaming-a-week&quot;&gt;gaming time for minors&lt;/a&gt; is an ambitious step. I am not convinced
about its utility; but I can see that drastic changes are required to curb Big Tech’s unfettered
access to data collection and the Chinese state does not balk under pressure from Big Tech
lobbyists. This alone is encouraging to me and I hope that it convinces democratic governments to
try something in their own jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life on Lockdown in China (Hessler)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/life-on-lockdown-in-china&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/08Piz&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 30 March, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;China’s system works in times of crises. Societal responsibility, a collectivist mindset and
swift government action &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; the answer to COVID19. Every country that tried other approaches
failed at getting a good outcome for society. This article also shows the early opposition to
school closures. (Even as early as March 2020.) It also ends on a hopeful note during a short
period of relaxation in lockdown regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China Crushed Jack Ma, His Fintech Rivals Might Be Next (Chen et al)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/how-xi-and-the-ccp-turned-on-jack-ma-ant-and-china-s-fintech-companies&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/0LNum&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 25 June, 2021&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The action that the Chinese government took against Jack Ma (his mysterious disappearance, his
reappearance, his changed positions) right after he voiced his opinion about the Chinese
political system was a stunning reminder of the depth of state power. Just as this article
prophesized, the Chinese government has gone ahead with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/china-deems-all-crypto-related-transactions-illegal-in-crackdown&quot;&gt;a complete ban on cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt;
(ostensibly a “Financial technology” business).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s Risky Bet on Afghanistan (Marlow, Curran)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-24/china-s-eyes-1-trillion-of-minerals-with-risky-bet-on-taliban&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/OogSp&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 24 August, 2021&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;China is flexing its muscle on the global stage and warzones seem like the best place to make a
big profit, at a modest investment, owing to the high risk nature of the investment. This is due
to the chaotic nature of the post-war period in general. In the case of Afghanistan, the chaos is
compounded by the debacle that was the American withdrawal from its 20-year war in
August 2021. Biden and his administration have tried hard to reinforce the idea that 120,000
people were evacuated from Afghanistan during the withdrawal. They have repeatedly distanced
themselves from the original commitment to end the war and talked about how they were simply
abiding by an agreement that their predecessor had drawn up. They have also taken pains to
emphasize their commitment to democracy and women’s rights (even as questions have risen about
their domestic commitment to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/podcasts/the-daily/voting-rights-georgia.html&quot;&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/us/politics/scotus-abortion-decision.html&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; issues.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It is clear that America lost the war, left the country in shambles and handed the country over
to a government whose goals are unclear and whose conduct is erratic.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Strangely, Biden’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/08/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-end-of-the-war-in-afghanistan/&quot;&gt;remarks about ending the war&lt;/a&gt; did not reflect the celebrated American
exceptionalism that appeared to me to be a main stay of articles and TV shows about America:
(such as Robinson’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/opinion/sunday/america-patriotism.html&quot;&gt;Don’t Give Up On America&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To me, there are two [things] that are paramount.  First, we must set missions with clear,
achievable goals — not ones we’ll never reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In this environment, a government with a larger appetite for risk will be able to make some
meaningful gains. China has taken this leap of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xi Jinping May Be Leading China Into a Trap (Brooker)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-06/china-s-common-prosperity-goal-ends-in-a-middle-income-trap&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/LtDLv&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 9 June, 2021&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;What is the West’s fear about China? It is that Xi and the Chinese Communist Party will rewrite
the rules of traditional economics and show that the power of markets, which is fetishized by
institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank, is limited and only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the many possible
pathways to transitioning from a lower-income economy to a higher-income economy. This article
crystallizes the terror that Xi’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-23/china-is-said-to-mull-turning-tutoring-firms-into-non-profits&quot;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; non-capitalist reforms strike in the hearts of the
traditional capitalists: Capital is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;King&lt;/em&gt;; Governments that focus on Social Reform &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;
succeed. Bloomberg Media is owned by Michael Bloomberg and is pro-capitalism and staffed by
economists who believe that the West’s path out of poverty is the only path that exist and is
viable. Their articles criticizing Xi and the Chinese government for not accepting the power of
markets or institutions always provide an interesting perspective. For me, they show the height
of the pedestal on which these journalists and economists place markets, even though they will
freely admit that they are tools for development and ridden with many shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This paragraph stood out to me:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If Xi succeeds in steering China into the high-income bracket without undertaking the institutional
reforms that have accompanied the transition in other countries, then it would rewrite the rules of
conventional economics and burnish the international standing of Beijing’s authoritarian governance
model. Developed democracies have hardly demonstrated their superiority in this regard recently,
having failed to reverse their own decades-long trend of widening inequality (even if disparities
mostly remain far narrower than in China).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This rewriting of rules spells disaster for most publications, and is a common thread I have
noticed in recent China coverage. Bloomberg is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s Port Shutdown Raises Fears of Closures Worldwide (Deaux, Li, Koh)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-12/massive-china-port-shutdown-raises-fears-of-closures-worldwide&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/FWKBz&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 13 August, 2021&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;World trade. I have found the topic to be confusing and intractable. How can the delay of a
shipment in Philippines stop assembly lines halfway across the world? Now, I understand the basic
contours of this concept: companies set up supply chains to procure materials from around the
world (because they get it from the cheapest buyer) and assemble them at some central place; each
component that they procure has its own supply chain. This article demonstrated the fragility and
sensitivity of this system well. A port closure in China saw shipping volumes drop across the
world. Shipping prices have been spiking since last year due to unrelated reasons and both bulk
and container shipping prices were affected. This article is not very detailed in how the port
shutdown affects the prices of real-life products; Nevertheless, it is a good primer. I’ll be on
the lookout for another article which expands on the topics covered here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Open Source Software Business Models</title>
   <link href="/2021/09/15/open-source-software-business-models"/>
   <updated>2021-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/09/15/open-source-software-business-models</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/13/opensearch_10/&quot;&gt;A few days ago&lt;/a&gt;, AWS released version 1 of OpenSearch, a fork of ElasticSearch. OpenSearch is
open-source software licensed under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/&quot;&gt;Apache License v2&lt;/a&gt;. ElasticSearch’s creator, a for-profit
company called Elastic Co. has been involved in a dispute with AWS for months now. The dispute
began when AWS packaged ElasticSearch and started offering a managed service on their cloud
platform. There seems to have been no partnership between AWS and Elastic, and this lack of a
partnership has irked Elastic no end. This raises a question that others have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2021/the-oss-bubble-and-the-blogging-bubble/&quot;&gt;attempted&lt;/a&gt; to answer:
What is the business model for free and open-source software? Who should fund its development? Who
should benefit from the profits made using that software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like free and open-source software (OSS). My rationale for using it is simple: It allows me to
&lt;strong&gt;choose&lt;/strong&gt; how I spend my time. I can decide what software packages to use, which version and for how
long. If I don’t like a future version of a software, then I can stick with the version I like,
until the time that security fixes are released for the version I have. I can decide the OS version
I want to use and use it for &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases&quot;&gt;10 years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; without having to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/get-macos-updates-mchlpx1065/mac&quot;&gt;install updates&lt;/a&gt; or upgrade my hardware
because a future version of the OS slows down my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macbookproslow.com/after-updating-to-newer-macos/&quot;&gt;computer&lt;/a&gt;. (Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/183004/why-android-phones-slow-down-over-time-and-how-to-speed-them-up/&quot;&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;.) This “decade-long end-of-life
cycle” is important to me because I don’t want to spend any time installing, updating or upgrading
operating systems&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have an ideological reason for using open-source software. The open-source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.html&quot;&gt;ideologues&lt;/a&gt; and
open-source software users are not one and the same. Most people in the former group are also in the
latter, while a minority of the latter is made up of ideologues. Consequently, I don’t think that
open-source software is the silver bullet to solve &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; problems. Proprietary software regularly
solves problems much better than OSS can ever aspire to: IntelliJ is a set of proprietary tools for
working with PHP that is very powerful and I use it at work when working with a large PHP
codebase. It has a good plugin ecosystem and supports every process of the software development
cycle. Photoshop and the Adobe ecosystem for editing photo and video files is another example of
proprietary software &lt;em&gt;basically&lt;/em&gt; taking over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another piece of proprietary software changed the nature of computing for billions of people:
Windows is the most widely used operating system. It’s usage is widespread enough that most people
(including me) started computing on a Windows machine at home or in school. Without a powerful OS
such as Windows which was easily available on computers from major brands, fewer people would have
access to a computer and the Internet today. Windows solved the access problem &lt;strong&gt;extremely well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source software is a huge beast. There are millions of projects with wide variety in the ways
in which they are funded, maintained and the ways in which the project’s backers ensure its
longevity. I will look at three models that are common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;no-business-model&quot;&gt;No Business Model&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest business model is to &lt;strong&gt;not have&lt;/strong&gt; any business model. Most projects on GitHub are not
written with any aim to make money from them. Widely used tools such as ripgrep, &lt;a href=&quot;https://notmuchmail.org/&quot;&gt;notmuch&lt;/a&gt; and htop do
not solicit donations&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The maintainers of these projects have been working on them for a long
time but they do not expect any monetary gain from their work. Philosophical reasons for this
apparently altruistic endeavor aside, this business model is popular and hassle-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While for-profit companies can start open-source projects with the intention of making money at some
point in the future, community-driven projects (projects that start with a single maintainer or a
few people working on it in their free time) are more common. This lack of a business model at the
inception of a project makes it hard to implant it into the project at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such project which tried to put in a business model at a later stage was the company behind the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.com/&quot;&gt;Brave browser&lt;/a&gt;, based on Chromium and published by for-profit Brave Software, Inc., started out
without any good business model. It has since tried to introduce “Attention tokens” and make an
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/brave-software/company_financials&quot;&gt;Initial Coin Offering&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; thing to do in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable proprietary to “free and open-source” software transformation story is Microsoft’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;Visual
Studio Code editor&lt;/a&gt;. It has an interesting history. The proprietary software called VSCode was
originally released in 2015 and seems to have come out of the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE
project. In the subsequent years, Microsoft released most of the code behind VSCode, and published
that as an open-source editor under the permissive MIT license. Microsoft maintains a distribution
of the open-source editor which includes some proprietary assets but is free for private and
commercial use. The Community version of the parent product (Visual Studio IDE - Community) is
available for free download but can’t be used in Enterprise settings. This Enterprise version of
VisualStudio IDE is the product that Microsoft sells to companies. (The product is similar to
IntelliJ but not as versatile or modern as it sticks with technologies that are used to develop
Windows apps, such as C# and ASP.NET.) Microsoft chose the “No Business Model” path for the
open-source Visual Studio distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;for-profit-companies-redistribute-for-a-fee&quot;&gt;For-Profit Companies Redistribute for a Fee&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original large-scale open source projects was the Linux kernel, the software that sits between
the operating system and the hardware that it is running on. Linux became very popular and people
spent large amounts of their time working on the Linux codebase. Eventually, a non-profit called the
Linux Foundation hired the maintainer. This enabled the maintainer to spend all his time on
maintaining the kernel and deciding the long-term roadmap of the project. The non-profit foundation
is supported through donor contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most large companies use Linux in some form. Large scale cloud platform providers like AWS, GCP and
Azure use Linux to deploy their datacenters and offer several services which are based on Linux and
other open source projects to their users such as Google’s Compute Engines which offers virtual
machines running Linux operating systems for Compute or Google’s Kubernetes Engine which is a
managed service running the open-source Kubernetes container orchestration software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These profits (or a part of them) don’t directly make their way back to the Linux maintainers, and
the maintainers are okay with that because they are getting back &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; compensation to work on
the project full time and keep the project going&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For-profit companies like Canonical (publisher of Ubuntu) and Red Hat (publisher of CentOS) have
built open-source software on top of the Linux kernel. This software is free and open-source as
well, these for-profit companies redistribute the free software for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another recent open-source project is Wireguard. Wireguard can be used to create a secure Virtual
Private Network (VPN) between any two devices which are on the same network (e.g. the Internet, a
router inside a house or at an office). The maintainer began working on this as a side project and
as a replacement for OpenVPN, the historical VPN standard. Wireguard also runs on donations from
companies and individuals, in the form of money and hardware, as a way to express gratitude for the
work that the maintainers are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailscale is a for-profit company which sells a service that uses Wireguard underneath and allows
users to create a network between all the devices that they own using Single Sign-On providers like
Google and Microsoft to authenticate&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies like Canonical, Red Hat, and Tailscale are not under any obligation to donate to the
maintenance of the software that their businesses are based on. But most such companies which are
redistributing free software for a fee, with added features, do donate back to their root
projects. This generosity is one clear business model for open-source software maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model has some conflicts of interests in the form of a donor asking for features to be
prioritized based on their business requirements. Most open-source projects have some kind of
private mailing list or offline meetup where the most frequent contributors decide the trajectory of
the project and brainstorm about the roadmap and longevity of the project. I don’t hold any grudge
against maintainers for this kind of non-public discussion, as I don’t believe that the public
square is the right place to decide the road map of any open-source project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;maintainers-redistribute-for-a-fee&quot;&gt;Maintainers Redistribute for a Fee&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this type of business model is at the center of the AWS-Elastic dispute. Elastic is the
for-profit company that maintains ElasticSearch, a full-text search engine that is popular in
consumer-facing applications. Most search engines are either running ElasticSearch or running
something very similar to it. This search engine product powers product search in e-commerce
applications, timeline search inside social networks and full-text search in some blogs and
text-based websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a Cloud computing platform. AWS offers several “Managed services”,
services that have considerably lower maintenance costs due to their “managed” nature. These
services are preferred by small software engineering teams as it frees up their time and enables
them to focus on product development and rely on AWS for the maintenance of mission-critical
software like the relational DB at the center of their operation or the search engine that powers
their user’s search queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core dispute in the AWS/ElasticSearch episode seems to be the use of the “ElasticSearch” term in
the name of AWS’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/&quot;&gt;managed service&lt;/a&gt;. Elastic offers its own products such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/site-search/&quot;&gt;Site Search&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/app-search/&quot;&gt;App Search&lt;/a&gt;
that use ElasticSearch under-the-hood and are sold with convenience features that make it easier to
integrate them into real-world applications real-world applications. The AWS managed service and
some of Elastic’s products are competing for the same part of the consumer search market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar product, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/google-cloud-platform-partners-elastic-offer-managed-open-source-search-and-analytics-gcp/&quot;&gt;Elastic Cloud on GCP&lt;/a&gt;, is offered by Google Cloud Platform (GCP), a competitor of
AWS. The key difference between the two managed services seems to be that GCP and Elastic entered
into a partnership, while AWS struck out on its own to create the product that it wanted, without
any consultation with Elastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elastic did not like what AWS did at all. In fact, it annoyed them &lt;strong&gt;so much&lt;/strong&gt; that they decided to
&lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; the license that ElasticSearch is distributed under:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It also protects our continued investment in developing products that we distribute for free and in
the open by restricting cloud service providers from offering Elasticsearch and Kibana as a service
without contributing back.
– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing&quot;&gt;https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This business model is a dicey one and ridden with conflicts of interest. Elastic was not really
on board with free and open-source software from the get-go, especially if the software was deployed
on a large scale and could possibly poach the market share that it held through its own managed
service products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change in license was the right thing to do, as it clarifies their intention behind maintaining
ElasticSearch: The license should embody exactly how the maintainer wants users to treat their
software. Their decision to delay this change this long seems to be based on their false conviction
that few people will be able to &lt;em&gt;figure out&lt;/em&gt; how to run ElasticSearch at scale without Elastic’s
help or that a competitor with as many existing customers as AWS will not step on their toes, due to
fear of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS’ decision to fork ElasticSearch to continue offering the managed service and a search engine
that is modern and innovative was also the right one. The fork, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-opensearch/&quot;&gt;OpenSearch&lt;/a&gt;, has had a good start,
reaching version 1.0 in 3 months. (The project began at a stable ElasticSearch version anyway, so
this might not be as big a milestone as reaching 1.0 is for other projects.) As the two projects
diverge, it will be interesting to see which one outpaces the other in terms of development and new
features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elastic has nothing to do but work on ElasticSearch, whereas AWS is a cloud-computing company,
running one service based on this fork. I would like to see AWS succeed in maintaining the fork and
continuing the addition of interesting features long into the future. But the fact that this will
not be their only priority seems like a risk for early adopters of OpenSearch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important question which the product will have to deal with down the line would be whether
they would like to maintain compatibility with ElasticSearch in the configuration and query
language. AWS (the business) would prefer maintaining this compatibility. The project maintainers
might have different opinions in the interest of the future health of the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2021-09-15:&lt;/strong&gt; As I was editing this post, ElasticSearch &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py/pull/1623&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; to update their Open Source
clients to stop allowing connections using their maintained clients to OpenSearch clusters. Amazon
has &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/opensource/keeping-clients-of-opensearch-and-elasticsearch-compatible-with-open-source/&quot;&gt;forked&lt;/a&gt; Elastic’s search clients and plans to maintain both the search engine (OpenSearch) and
its clients in several programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To give these users a clear path forward, the OpenSearch project will add a set of new open source
clients that make it easy to connect applications to any OpenSearch or Elasticsearch cluster. These
clients will be derived from the last compatible versions of corresponding Elastic-maintained
clients before product checks were added.
– &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/opensource/keeping-clients-of-opensearch-and-elasticsearch-compatible-with-open-source/&quot;&gt;Keeping clients of OpenSearch and Elasticsearch compatible with open source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elastic’s decision to prevent connections to OpenSearch has increased Amazon’s maintenance cost
manifold. I hope that this move does not deter AWS from their open-source software crusade.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Suggestions For Better Government Services</title>
   <link href="/2021/09/14/government-services"/>
   <updated>2021-09-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/09/14/government-services</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have dealt with government services in multiple places now, and I believe that I have found the
common pitfalls that service providers often fall into. This post is not a rant. There is already a
lot of documented evidence of governments that were unable to deliver services well, frequently
leading to consequences ranging from mild annoyances to tragic outcomes like death: Regional
passport offices, post offices, nationalized banks like State Bank of India and Regional Transport
Offices (RTOs) in India, &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2021/05/78b324eca065-family-of-dead-sri-lankan-woman-visit-japan-detention-facility.html&quot;&gt;Immigration centers in Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and healthcare.gov and DMV in the US. This
post lists some of the simple enhancements that service providers can implement at low to medium
costs to improve the consumer’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-internet-is-a-powerful-communication-tool-use-it-wisely&quot;&gt;The Internet Is A Powerful Communication Tool. Use It Wisely.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a line between using the Internet to disseminate information to consumers, and designating
the Internet as the only medium through which service can be obtained. The latter is ridden with
problems emanating from unequal &lt;a href=&quot;/democracy/governments/2021/06/28/access-and-governance/&quot;&gt;access&lt;/a&gt; to the Internet and is not a good idea. On the other
hand, the former is a noble cause and service providers should put information about the services
that they provide, the times that they are open, and the amount of time that each service is
expected to take on their websites. The websites should be easily accessibly in the commonly spoken
regional languages&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gold standard is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isa.go.jp/en/applications/procedures/index.html&quot;&gt;the list of procedures&lt;/a&gt; on the Immigration Services website of Japan. These
services can be availed by foreigners in Japan. The website is available in Japanese and English,
and each procedure has the essential things that people want to know about it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;List of required documents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Standard processing duration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where to go, timings that the office will be open for&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fee that the applicant will have to pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the absolute minimum that the applicant must know before they go to the center. To avoid
multiple trips, maintaining an accurate list on the website will reduce the administrative load of
the service provider (people will not have to be told &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to bring or told to come back later)
and will make the applicant’s life immeasurably easier. The reduced anxiety and stress that is felt
by applicants is &lt;em&gt;objectively&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;a good thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;use-token-numbers-instead-of-queues&quot;&gt;Use Token Numbers Instead Of Queues&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common image is a line of people who are standing in a queue outside a government office. In
pouring rain or under the hot sun, the line of people remains unchanged; while the service provider
is sitting inside an air conditioned office under a concrete roof, with a hot beverage on their
desk. The injustice is painfully obvious, and this cruelty serves no one. This system is open to
caricature and Kafka does government caricature better than anyone else. (Suffocating rooms inside
bureaucracies are as common in his novel, Trial as primary colors in a child’s landscape painting.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Token numbers&lt;/strong&gt; are the obvious solution to this problem. The service provider’s office should have
two doors: one with a simple reception where monotonically increasing token numbers are dispensed to
people, along with the time at which they should show up. The other door leads the applicants into
the actual office where they can apply for the document or the service that they came for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution is fairly common in Indian banks in metro cities where almost all the business in a
bank can be done by getting a token when one enters the bank, waiting (while seated) in the chairs and
benches around the branch, and watching a television screen that displays the token number that is
currently being serviced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of such a system is extremely cost-effective. Both the economic cost and the
administrative cost of setting up such a system is minimal. I would go so far as to say that a
motivated bureaucrat with the appropriate amount of political capital within their department can
turn around the functioning of any government office and increase the efficiency manifold through
such a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, this kind of system is open to data collection. Once the system is working smoothly,
bureaucrats at higher levels should be able to easily collect data about what kind of services are
taking up too long to dispense and how these processes can be improved to reduce the burden on
government workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this suggestion, I will offer a caveat. The &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; next step to this “Token numbers” system
is the one which tries to allocate appointments to people through an appointment system on the
Internet. This increases the benefits for the applicants manifold. But for the service provider,
implementing such a system is &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; high cost. The economic cost of implementing such a system
is quite high. The initial administrative cost of starting this implementation is nearly
insurmountable in most government settings where short-term results are key to career advancement. A
long-term project which starts with a tendering process to find a digital vendor to build this
appointment booking portal will almost always end in tears&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s Passport Application Process went through a revolutionary change between the first time I
applied for a passport in 2005 and the most recent time I applied for one in 2015. The system went
from a standard, Kafkaesque government office experience (complete with mezzanine ceilings, wooden
benches set against concrete walls, and the essential profound, suffocating despair) to a modern
office building run by a private company that prizes efficiency with a single government functionary
who takes the final decision about whether the passport should be issued or not. One prominent
part of this new system is the appointment booking system which allows applicants to fill out all
their information online and then reach the passport office at the appointed time for their
appointment. But there’s a major problem in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system is based on government information and does not clearly explain what documents are
required from each type of applicant. The list of documents change depending on your age, your phase
of life, and whether you are applying for a new passport or a renewal of your existing
passport. These rules are extremely hard to parse for human beings, but they are extremely easy for
a computer to navigate given the right number of inputs. In any case, the lack of this basic part of
the system ended up in an extra trip to the passport office for me because the documents that I had
were not sufficient.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;compassionate-service-providers-and-applicants&quot;&gt;Compassionate Service Providers &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; Applicants&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9edjiHjG94&quot;&gt;dehumanization of healthcare&lt;/a&gt; is a scourge in our society: the delivery of bad news to patients
has become another routine task. Medical dramas like Grey’s Anatomy and House M.D. frequently
feature compassionate healthcare providers in lead roles. A society-wide agreement about
dehumanization being bad for society is yet to come. Given that cliffhanger of a decision that
society is (as yet) unwilling to make, service providers inside governments can lead the charge by
employing a humane and compassionate workforce, filled with people who are willing to go the
distance for applicants who are (always) helpless and (totally) dependent on the whims of the
service providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece of advice applies to applicants as well. The spectacle of a frustrated applicant
screaming at or threatening a government functionary is not uncommon. The functionaries are often
themselves powerless, employed at the clerical level, and were probably in the wrong place at the
wrong time, leading to this humiliation. Here the applicant must also understand the wheels that are
in motion behind the scene. As a cog in the system, neither the applicant nor the government
employee can effect any large change. It would be wise for these two groups to stay together and
strive to implement changes that would benefit both groups, that so often seems out of reach, by
converting their shared anger and frustration into well-researched criticism and directing it at the
people who are setting up the systems rather than the people who are simply following handbooks
which are given to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary misalignment in all government services is that the application process is set-up to
&lt;strong&gt;prevent&lt;/strong&gt; a bad-faith actor from going through the process without tripping any of the wires, even
though the majority of the applicants that go through the process are good-faith actors, who do not
intend to hoodwink the government. In higher-income economies where economic tracking of the
citizenry is accurate and multi-pronged, governments are confident in their ability to identify
bad-faith actors without these exhausting roadblocks in routine application processes. In lower- and
middle-income economies where economic tracking is weak and ridden with loopholes, the government’s
trust in its citizens providing accurate information is low and &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; is the root cause of the high
administrative burden to acquiring services in these places. But &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; this burden can be made
easier to bear through low-cost solutions and governments which implement such solutions will find
much favor among the residents of their jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note here that I &lt;strong&gt;am not&lt;/strong&gt; recommending service providers to provide this information in a million different languages. The additional cost for building this kind of a multi-lingual website is considerable. The benefits that are gained are marginal. Services like DeepL.com and Google Translate are freely available and easy to integrate into most browsers even for normal users. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For a recent government service, I visited the website of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tnreginet.gov.in&quot;&gt;Tamil Nadu Registrar Offices&lt;/a&gt;. This portal has an appointment system and is complicated enough to warrant &lt;a href=&quot;https://tnreginet.gov.in/portal/webHP?requestType=ApplicationRH&amp;amp;actionVal=homePage&amp;amp;screenId=114&amp;amp;UserLocaleID=en&amp;amp;_csrf=cb3169ad-4875-4a66-90fb-958ceb2c8d95&quot;&gt;a user manual&lt;/a&gt; for each process that is offered on the portal. The user manuals are excellent with screenshots and instructions about each step in the application process. But creating them probably took as long as building the website itself. This extra cost is unnecessary and should be done away with in initial implementations of the token system. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A common parable about going to Indian government offices is that the officer there will ask you for the one document that you don’t have with you. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month’s theme is &lt;strong&gt;art and the artist.&lt;/strong&gt; I chose this theme because events in my life have
reminded me of the value of the abstract and incomprehensible. As places around the world open up
under varying levels of restrictions, the contemporary locations and events were art is showcased,
namely, cinemas, theaters, live concerts and art museums, are returning to their earlier glory and
posing an interesting question to a subset of the population that has the luxury of deciding whether
they want to attend: &lt;strong&gt;How much risk are you willing to take to see an artist perform live?&lt;/strong&gt; This
month’s list begins with an art critic who argues that our appreciation of art from the times when
life expectancy was low is bound to increase, owing to our own deeper experience of mortality
through pestilence. The list also includes articles about the perpetual search for the line between
art and the artist and about the limits of on-screen fantasy and escape, when the spectator’s real
life is in disarray.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out of Time (Schjeldahl)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/13/mortality-and-the-old-masters&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/OdohI&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 13th April, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I like going to museums of all kinds: art, natural history, national artifacts, museums
memorializing disasters. A quote that I read in a museum in Taiwan 3 years ago has remained with
me: “If we seek to understand the present and predict the future, the past is our only guide.”
Schjeldahl, a venerable art critic, writes about what differentiates the experience of seeing art
in person and seeing it on a computer screen or on a virtual tour. He also writes about the
overwhelming presence of death in ancient art; mortality was experienced an integral part of life
in the years when life expectancy was low and the reasons for death included even the most
mundane causes such as the common cold, compared to current times when it borders around the
periphery during normal times and when one thinks about death only as the consequence of severe
disease or disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy?tab=chart&amp;amp;time=1881..2015&amp;amp;country=~IND&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;He also writes about our return to art museums, a topic that I am particularly interested in. I
have been able to go to art museums and live concerts over the past year, during the brief period
that the pandemic let up in Japan in September and October 2020. As the relaxation continues and
more people return to art museums, I wonder if their tastes have changed and if we end up being
more enamored with the art of the “Ancient Masters” from having suffered through daily reminders
of the fragility of life in the form of case numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fearless Pianist (Ross)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/igor-levit-is-like-no-other-pianist&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/yHrdk&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 18th May, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the profile of a German pianist who is also a political activist. It delves into the
question of separating the Art that is produced by the artist and the artist themselves. This
question has haunted both artists and spectators for a while now. Over the past year, with the
accusations that sprung up against comedian Louis CK and the new documentaries about musicians R
Kelly and Michael Jackson, the question pushed through into the mainstream and reached a
population that had remained insulated. The ultimate decision about whether the connection
between art produced by an artist and the artist’s actions and opinions must be (necessarily)
left up to each individual. This article poses this question forcefully in the instance where the
artist’s political opinions don’t align with your own. It made me think about the artists that I
adore and how I would react to similar situations that involved them. I think that questioning
and clarifying your beliefs before the situation arises is the only way to stay &lt;em&gt;sane&lt;/em&gt; and
continue to patronize their art, respect the artist and defend yourself to others. Kendrick Lamar
poses the same question more succinctly in his song Mortal Man from the album To Pimp A
Butterfly:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot and Toxic (Goodyear)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/16/jordan-wolfsons-edgelord-art&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/Msyet&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 16th March, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Following along on the separation between art and artist, this profile of the artist Wolfson
focuses on the provocation that he sees his art as a vessel for. In this case, the artist’s
personal beliefs are not reflected in their art. In fact, the art is designed specifically to
incite the spectator into thinking about … &lt;em&gt;something.&lt;/em&gt; Being “edgy” has been an asset for
artists like Pollock, who thrived on abstract art with no definite interpretations. Everyone drew
on the canvas that Pollock had already drawn on; albeit they started with a slate that was packed
with material and guided their thoughts through particular paths, not letting them wander
aimlessly. Wolfson’s art is being made in the age of the Internet and career ending mis-steps can
come out of the artist’s inherent belief about the role of art in society. Is it safe, then, to
step outside the mainstream and create provocative art?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“All the Natalie Portmans” and The Limits of Hollywood Fantasy (Cunningham)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/16/all-the-natalie-portmans-and-the-limits-of-hollywood-fantasy&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/RRFop&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 16th March, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I liked this article on two levels. The first level was for the content: It is an amazing review
of a play which features a young teenager who dreams of being a screenwriter and idolizes the
actors who have made it big in the 2000s. The second level was for the effortless references that
the author draws on about Portman and her role in building a fantasy. She mentions several of
Portman’s movies and her recent Oscar appearance. Coincidentally, I happen to be reading Dyer’s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/351864.Heavenly_Bodies?from_search=true&amp;amp;from_srp=true&amp;amp;qid=5I51BtcxSP&amp;amp;rank=1&quot;&gt;Heavenly Bodies&lt;/a&gt;, an essay about how stars are made and what society really looks for in them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; This article introduced me to Dior ad campaign that stars Portman:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;iframe width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/h4s0llOpKrU&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chain Me Up: Harry Houdini and The Art of Escape (Denby)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/harry-houdini-and-the-art-of-escape&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/31BIU&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 30th March, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Houdini is a household name today. What was he escaping from? Was there some meaning to his art
and work? Or was it meaningless and simply the culmination of Houdini’s personal desires?
Houdini’s defiance of authority figures and the police in particular takes center stage in his
work. He demonstrated the crass, anti-authority culture of rebellion through an art form that
captivated everyone. But what he did was not sleight of hand or magic; his escapes were &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;
acts of strength backed by an endless amount of preparation and presented with a complete lack of
showmanship, which has traditionally been the mainstay for magicians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Power, Age and Maturity</title>
   <link href="/2021/08/22/power-age-and-maturity"/>
   <updated>2021-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/08/22/power-age-and-maturity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the minimum age requirements on various &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thoughtco.com/requirements-to-serve-as-president-3322199&quot;&gt;powerful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.examveda.com/the-minimum-age-required-to-become-the-prime-minister-of-india-is-5181/&quot;&gt;positions&lt;/a&gt; seem unnecessary. Why
should a meritorious individual be restricted from doing something that they would be good at simply
because they are too young? Over the past few years and especially over the past few weeks, I have
understood one of the reasons for these requirements: Power should be handed to people who have the
philosophical backing to handle it; they should be grounded in the understanding of their role; they
should not exploit the people who are newly under their power; they should know where the boundaries
of their power are and where it is being used for exploitation. Age is a proxy for this
maturity. Older people are assumed to have this maturity and younger people are assumed to be naive,
immature and ignorant. This is never really true. Age is a bad proxy for maturity. It fails in both
directions: Older people can be less mature (and younger people more mature) than their age would
lead you to assume. Most of these failures are not consequential as the power that these old people
hold in society is insignificant. But the power that they hold in your personal life can be
considerable and &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; is what I will dig into in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Power corrupts …”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is one of those phrases which is so popular that one needn’t even repeat
the whole quote. I did not quite understand what it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; meant. Sure, I understood the overall
concept of it: Someone gets some power somehow; they become arrogant and unreasonable; the people
around them try to take them down and are sometimes successful. But I did not understand the
real-life consequences of it before. Now that I understand what the “corrupts” in that quote
&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; means, I can see some past instances in my life where this principle was at work and where
people had been corrupted by the power that they believed themselves to be holding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;universities-are-small-ponds&quot;&gt;Universities Are Small Ponds&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most memorable instance is from college. Professors in my college had a lot of power. They were
instructors in courses where they had complete control over scoring, who passed the course, what
their grade was. Their hard power was taken to extremes during the Bachelors and Masters project
presentations which happened at the end of the fourth and fifth year of study. During the final year
“Grand Viva,” there is a positively absurd air around them and their questions, as memorialized in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amrav/amrav.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2016-04-12-grand-viva.md&quot;&gt;this brilliant piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ages of these professors varied. But most of them had only been in academia: Bachelors from a
college in India, Masters from somewhere in America, Ph.D. in America and Post-Doctoral Fellowship
in America or Europe. In their early 30s, they had turned up as an Assistant Professor with no real
&lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; to speak of. They were &lt;strong&gt;big fish in a small pond.&lt;/strong&gt; They did not know the size of the
ponds that were out there, and they had no interest in finding out, for they had &lt;em&gt;chosen&lt;/em&gt; to hole
themselves up in a remote location inside an echo chamber where no one dare challenge their views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as they arrive, they were given a large amount of power. Some of them were made “Faculty
Advisors,” a (mostly) meaningless position which required them to sign documents for a few students
doing bachelors courses. While this position’s requirements were nearly non-existent, this process
of getting your advisor’s signature on some document would strike dread into the heart of
even the most ardent believer in the rot that are bureaucratic processes. My experience was perhaps
slightly better than the worst ones and worse than the average experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advisor would sign papers from 4:30 pm to 5 pm on weekdays. (What Kafka reader would expect
government servants to work during the weekend?) During all other times, the papers would have to be
dropped into his letter box and he would sign them at his convenience, which would generally take a
couple days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one occasion, I had the (mis)fortune of having to get a signature by the end of the day due to a
quirk in the course registration process that required each document to go to the same person twice
and for them to give their approval once on paper and once on the computerized course registration
system. I arrived at the advisor’s office at 4:40 pm, well within the 5 pm time limit. I knocked on
his office door, which was at the center of a deserted fluid mechanics laboratory. After a few
seconds, the door opened a couple inches. I could barely see his face and perceived a pair of
piercing eyes which appeared annoyed at my presence outside &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; office door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the paper in my hand (I had had the presence of mind to &lt;em&gt;waste&lt;/em&gt; no more of &lt;strong&gt;his&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;precious&lt;/em&gt;
time than I needed to.) I started explaining what I wanted: “I need your sign to register for …”
Exasperated with my attempt to explain the situation to him, he cut me off and said “Okay.” He
proceeded to come outside the office and closed the door behind him. (He must have stepped out 1
feet or so and there was no invisible burglar hanging around behind my back. Perhaps he was
ecologically conscious and did not want power to be wasted through an Air conditioner which kept his
office at a comfortable 23 degrees, as the outside temperature was around 35 degree in the hot,
summer weather.) He snatched the paper from my hands, placed it on a nearby table, signed it near
the bottom, handed it back to me and disappeared back into his office. The quick glance that I
caught of his office did not show me anything remarkable: It was a bare office with a lot of empty
space, a computer, a table and chairs on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through this routine a few times during my 4 years under him as my advisor. There was no call
for this kind of behavior. In his early 30s, he had clearly not understood how to handle power (&lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;
how to be a considerate human being.) There was no sign that he wanted to, for he seemed to enjoy
this perverse dance and practiced it with everyone. In a college with tenured professors, there are
no avenues from which professors might be challenged or evaluated for their behavioral quirks. There
is no Human Resources Department that I could have appealed to for help. There was no Manager whom I
could have sent an email to about this absurd behavior. Their positions are extremely secure and no
professor has &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; been let go. Even the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Who-is-Professor-S-Ramanujam-from-the-Mechanical-Department-at-IIT-Kharagpur?share=1&quot;&gt;egregious&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/ME/faculty/me-rmnjm#resp-tab1&quot;&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt;, those who push the limits of
even the most eccentric understanding of the state of “normalcy”, hang around for several decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;88-believe-that-respecting-elders-is-very-important-to-being-truly-indian&quot;&gt;88% Believe That Respecting Elders Is Very Important To Being Truly Indian&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common pitfall of using age as a proxy for the ability to handle power is common inside
families. In this setting, age is a pure proxy: There are no qualifying or redeeming qualities that
one might appeal to. Nothing else is even worth considering as a criterion for absolute knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewforum.org/2021/06/29/religion-in-india-tolerance-and-segregation/&quot;&gt;Pew research center report&lt;/a&gt; confirmed this finding: 88% of the respondents said that
“respecting elders is a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; important part of being &lt;em&gt;Truly Indian&lt;/em&gt;.” Due to the (rather
unfortunate) linearity of our experience of time, it is always true that there will be people who
are older than you inside your family. How often you meet them hardly matters as long as you are
younger than them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the common phrases that your relatives will resort to when you challenge their
(often antiquated) beliefs with rational counter-arguments based in history and your understanding
of how society has changed since the time that those beliefs were formed or found to be fashionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are young and don’t know how things are done&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are young and don’t know &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have lived away from your native place for too long and have no idea how things are done
&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are trying to be different just for the sake of being different and you don’t actually
believe in the things that you are saying&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am older than you and you should not &lt;em&gt;talk back&lt;/em&gt; to me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These phrases are mildly amusing to me. At 25, I have the devil-may-care attitude typical to people
in their 20s. I have the temperamental luxury of using a combination of sentimentality and rational
thinking when deciding things, heavily biasing towards the latter as much as possible. Any
combination including rational thinking is anathema to the power-hungry, old person. Their power
comes from a combination of people respecting elders (extremely common) and being sentimental (not
uncommon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last phrase in the above list is worth examining some more. Children are often trained to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
“talk back” to elders when they are being berated and to instead nod their heads and move along and
do as the elders please. This turns out well for most kids; a minority of them seem to act out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obedience is conflated with tacit acceptance of the elders’ points-of-view. Obedience is further
conflated with respect and good manners. I disagree with both these conflations and I believe that
they are part of an insidious scheme to keep communities together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The conflations between obedience and acceptance, respect and manners is infuriating. I believe
that I can have a respectful debate without accepting my interlocutor’s point of view, respecting
them as a person with their own set of views, and staying within the boundaries of good manners. If
it is truly impossible to do this, then surely the understanding of “manners” must be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUfpfOU_4IY&quot;&gt;comical and
absurd&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People asking uncomfortable questions have introduced grievous rifts in religions and civilizations
before. One need only look to the rise of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegreatcoursesdaily.com/the-religious-impact-of-the-printing-press/&quot;&gt;Lutheranism (Protestantism) and the split of Christianity&lt;/a&gt;
into the two modern sects of Catholics and Protestants. Luther’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://reverendluther.org/pdfs/The_Ninety-Five_Theses.pdf&quot;&gt;questions&lt;/a&gt; were an attempt at
challenging a practice that aimed to extort money from the followers of the Catholic Church. &lt;em&gt;Even&lt;/em&gt;
the Catholic Church, an institution as old as they come, could not provide a satisfactory answer and
thus the revolution began. How the Catholic Church must wish that Luther had been taught &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; to
question institutions that were significantly older than any human alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This historical weakness of civilizations to questioning individuals and the ultimate refuge of
sentimentality is embedded inside our appetite to convince children not to “talk back” to
elders. The same teaching also applies to people who happen to be young at the current moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will attempt to boil down what I want to say: &lt;strong&gt;Believe&lt;/strong&gt; in something and &lt;strong&gt;Act&lt;/strong&gt; with conviction. As
for what &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt; will say when you do so, I will take a few lines from Seneca’s Letters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You needn’t believe the chatter of the people around you: there’s nothing in all this that’s evil,
insupportable or even hard. Those people are afraid of these things by a kind of general
consent. Are you going to feel alarm at death, then, in the same way as you might at some common
report? What could be more foolish than a man’s being afraid of people’s words? My friend has a nice
way of putting things when he says that to him the utterances of the unenlightened are as noises
emanating from the belly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;/book-review/philosophy/seneca/2021/03/21/letters-stoic-review/&quot;&gt;Letters From A Stoic (Seneca)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This was first said by Lord Acton and his views on why power always corrupts are summarized in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acton.org/pub/religion-liberty/volume-2-number-6/power-corrupts&quot;&gt;this essay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Monthly Recommendations (July 2021)</title>
   <link href="/2021/07/31/monthly-recommendations-2021-july"/>
   <updated>2021-07-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/07/31/monthly-recommendations-2021-july</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month’s theme is &lt;strong&gt;cities, islands and the places that we live in.&lt;/strong&gt; Few events in my life have
triggered as much introspection about the city that I live in and the places that I go to as the
ongoing pandemic. Over the past year, people have left cities and retreated into the countryside,
finding that their work remains unaffected even if they don’t go to offices and don’t meet their
coworkers in real life. But how should we account for the damage to the &lt;em&gt;city’s fabric&lt;/em&gt; because of
these exits? Optimists continue to believe that things will go back to the way they were and that
there will be no long-term impact due to this aberration that we are living through; I count myself
in this group, foolhardy as it might be to expect a future identical to the past. Revolutionaries
and activists see the leveling of lifestyles between geographies as a step towards equality, a
spiritual return to the mixed socioeconomic class communities that were fixtures of towns and
villages up to the late 19th century. In an effort to explore this ongoing change more fully, this
month I recommend a photo essay that documents a nurse’s daily life, an article about the differing
paths for social change depending on the average income of the district that you live in, and an
essay about how the place that you grow up in is embedded within your personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As the COVID-19 pandemic started taking hold and hospitals around the world, starting with Italy
and then New York and then pretty much everywhere at once, dealt with a huge number of
hospitalizations, politicians started expressing gratitude to essential workers at the beginning
of all their speeches. Indian leaders started extolling these people as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/fallen-warriors-indias-healthcare-workers-during-covid-19/cid/1792886&quot;&gt;“warriors.”&lt;/a&gt; These
rhetorical changes did not go hand-in-hand with policy changes that might alleviate unprecedented
pressures on underfunded healthcare systems. This photo essay details the life of a nurse who
went through the worst parts of the pandemic in New York. This was a powerful reminder that the
people working inside hospitals were put on a pedestal, but nothing was done to protect them or
to improve their lot by politicians &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; society at-large. The gratitude expressed never turned
into collective action (wearing masks, social distancing) or policy action (building large field
hospitals, preparation for subsequent waves). Cady Chaplin, the nurse profiles in this article,
reacted to the platitudes with matter-of-fact stoicism:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Many evenings, at seven, Chaplin can hear the cheering and honking, the nightly tribute to the
“essential workers” who are keeping the city alive. The sound often makes her tear up with
gratitude, but she is wary when she hears platitudes about the “heroic” work of health-care
professionals. She doesn’t want to be glorified all of a sudden. “This is what we trained to
do,” she says. “This is what we do. That was true a year ago, and it will be true a year from
now.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Working patterns have changed over the past year, and if you live in a city, you might have
asked yourself what it is about cities that attracts and retains people despite there being no
requirement to live there anymore. This is a story that is still being written; cities &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt;
well become less popular and end up as abandoned jungles of concrete-and-glass buildings with
empty offices. But there is very little indication that &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is the direction we are headed
for. And so, when people return to cities from their present hiatuses (either from inside their
homes or from a completely different place), will the fabric that bound it together remain
unchanged? Or has it been damaged by the temporary abandonment? The message in this article is
pretty clear although it is not explicitly stated: &lt;strong&gt;When the rich-and-wealthy abandon the city
where they made their fortune, people notice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This article, written by SNL Weekend Update’s co-host Colin Jost, is about how the cities that
we grow up in are special to us simply because we were there during our formative years. I catch
myself waxing nostalgic about how great the city that I grew up in was, even though I never
really knew much more of it than the neighborhoods that my house and school were in. Stranger
still, I sometimes vehemently defend it against any attack from people who lived there as adults
and saw much more of its people and their idiosyncrasies. I doubt that this feeling will ever
change for me and this article helped me understand its roots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The wealthy and the well-connected inhabit a world where social change comes from private
activities much more frequently than from the traditional route of dreary city council meetings
and convincing elected officials. This excerpt from a new book about the American company, Juul,
details the campaign against its “vaping products”, a cigarette-like product that emits white
smoke and delivers nicotine instead of cigarette’s mix of tobacco and nicotine, in one of
America’s wealthiest districts. In these parts, acquaintances from the upper deck seats of a
college football stadium can lead to increased pressure on a private company from its regulatory
body. Things get done, undoubtedly; whether the benefits of these changes will reach people
outside the wealthy parts is not their concern. This article reads like a thriller and introduces
a train of interesting characters, each armed with a roster of powerful connections.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Let's Talk About Facebook</title>
   <link href="/2021/07/25/lets-talk-about-facebook"/>
   <updated>2021-07-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/07/25/lets-talk-about-facebook</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;American President Joe Biden recently made a sensational comment insinuating that Facebook’s
permissive stance towards vaccine misinformation was “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/us/politics/biden-facebook-social-media-covid.html&quot;&gt;killing people&lt;/a&gt;.” This sensational attempt to
blame Facebook for his administration’s inability to hit vaccination campaign targets left a bad
taste in my mouth. I could not quite understand how he could credibly blame a private company, while
he himself sat at the helm of the Federal Government. It reminded me of an exchange from the TV show
West Wing in which the president says, “School boards and local elections are where true governance
takes place.”  In the TV show, the president’s comment is used to show how unhinged and paranoid the
President had become and how he had let personal enmity cloud his judgment. (His advisors point out
to him later that he has bigger fish to fry and can’t get involved in these local elections or swing
them using his pulpit.) In the real world, Biden has used this technique to create a scapegoat for
his administration’s failings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the time that Facebook came on the scene, someone has been completely in love with it, while
someone else has been incensed at its existence. I believe that Facebook is polarizing because it
demands something radical of the people who believe that they have some understanding of the world
around them: &lt;strong&gt;Adapt to something &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; new.&lt;/strong&gt; This demand is rarely made by an ill-defined private
entity with a misunderstood product and a (sadly) robotic CEO who can’t quite express what his goal
for the product is. (When I watch Zuckerberg talk about his company, I wish he would just say that
all he wanted to do with Facebook was build a cool engineering product and make a lot of money with
it.) A demand like this one is not novel. But in the past, these demands were made by revolutionary,
charming CEOs with well-understood products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two similar adaptation demands that come to mind are the ones made by Ford, who pioneered the
auto-assembly line and increased auto-manufacturing productivity many-fold, and Steve Jobs, who
pioneered the iPhone and insisted on every human being’s fundamental right to have a computer in
their pocket. They insisted that society should live with these improvements, however uncomfortable
they made the &lt;em&gt;old guard&lt;/em&gt; of their time. The iPhone, in particular, was marketed by a
sometimes-crazy, sometimes-revolutionary founder. These two adaptations became a part of the
mainstream very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s trajectory was similar: millions of users adopted it across the world. And yet, no one
quite knew what to make of it. &lt;strong&gt;What happens when a misunderstood product becomes wildly popular?&lt;/strong&gt; I
think the answer to this question is the key to understanding where Facebook is right now. Facebook
is on the cusp of becoming a scapegoat for spreading misinformation, is waiting for the other shoe
to drop on antitrust allegations in the US, and is facing a mutiny among its employees, whose
political beliefs are not representative of those of its user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding, I will put my cards on the table: I don’t use Facebook anymore. I used it a lot
from 2010 to 2014. I used it much less from 2014 to 2016. And I stopped using it around 5 years ago,
when I was in my third year of college, because I could see that it was making me actively
agitated. (This was the period in my life when it seemed like everyone around me was landing an
internship or a conference talk and going abroad for the first time; while I was going to Bangalore
to intern at a start-up no one knew much about.) I have a libertarian view of the usage of
technology and the Internet. I think that people who like to use Facebook should use it. I don’t
believe that paternalistic entities (like the government or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224&quot;&gt;a Netflix documentary&lt;/a&gt;) counseling people
about the evils of social media is going to help one bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;strong&gt;let’s talk about Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, the most thorny question of all: what is Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Facebook is a product which allows people to post text and images, add other people as their
friends, follow celebrities and news websites who post content, and see content posted by their
friends and the pages they have followed in a constant stream called the Newsfeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a mouthful. I tried to boil down Facebook’s core feature, Newsfeed, that also happens to be
the most controversial. The other parts of Facebook are widely accepted as useful (or at least not
harmful enough as the Newsfeed): messaging, games, groups, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-algorithm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Algorithm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things that show up on a person’s Newsfeed and the order that they are displayed in is decided
by &lt;em&gt;“the Algorithm”&lt;/em&gt;. This constant reference to the algorithm is misleading. The thinking around
this algorithm goes something like this: Facebook has a system where they can specify the weights
for each of the pieces of content that a person is &lt;em&gt;eligible&lt;/em&gt; to see. (These pieces of content enter
this list because they were posted by the user’s friends, friends of friends, a page they follow, a
group they are a member of, or because a recommendation algorithm predicted that the user will like
said piece of content, among others.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubt that Facebook’s internal systems are anywhere near that simple or easy to customize. My
prediction is that the algorithm is a combination of handmade heuristics and one or more machine
learning models, which have optimized to move some metric in the desired direction. (Common metrics
could be of the form: Maximize the amount of time a user spends on Facebook; Maximize the number of
comments that they post in a given time span.)  Each machine learning model would try to classify
the user into one of several buckets that it has created based on training data. Then, for each
piece of content that it sees, it would decide how likely that piece of content is to move its goal
metric in the direction that is desired. After this calculation, it would present the pieces of
content to the user in an order of decreasing likelihood. (This is all complete speculation based on
my experience with similar recommendation algorithms and my understanding about how such a system
would be designed if it were to be designed from scratch. Facebook probably does not have such a
simple, easy-to-understand design, because the system was not built from scratch, rather, it was
built in an iterative fashion.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By simplifying this possibly very complex system into “the Algorithm”, administration officials and
activists can effectively use Facebook as a scapegoat for &lt;em&gt;pretty much anything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Surgeon General Vivek Murthy specifically calls on companies to redesign their algorithms to “avoid
amplifying misinformation.” He also suggests that they build more “friction” into sharing functions
that urge users to rethink whether to share a post containing false information.
– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines&quot;&gt;Surgeon General calls on Social Media Companies to Curb Misinformation on Their Platforms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of control implied in the above suggestion shifts blame effortlessly. It paints Facebook
as the private corporation which is unwilling to take steps to fix its algorithm, implying that the
only thing lacking is Facebook’s desire to make such changes. The nuances of whether such changes
are possible and how effective they would be is missing from this characterization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content posted by users on any platform is diverse and it is impossible to classify something as
“containing false information”. The Internet will confirm your beliefs and your stand on any
topic. There is very little objectivity remaining in the topics that have become part of the common
discourse today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am putting aside the philosophical debate about what misinformation even is. A few examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is something that is reported on a major news network misinformation?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the photograph of a report published in the New York Times misinformation, &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; the original
report had a material error and the photo was shared without the subsequent correction?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is the arbiter in these cases? If it is the judiciary, is that branch of government
independent enough from the executive to say that the executive was spreading misinformation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suggestion to make it harder to share “false information” assumes that Facebook is an omniscient
entity which can classify something as false. Softening the definition of misinformation to “widely
believed to be false” is not helpful because we are stuck with the same classification
problem. Technological solutions are not the root cause of the misinformation problem. The root
cause is not knowing what misinformation even is, until something becomes popular enough to warrant
further investigation, a fact check, or public uproar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;private-corporations-are-not-governments&quot;&gt;Private Corporations are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Governments&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this needs to be repeated: Facebook is a private corporation. Milton Friedman, the economist
behind shareholder capitalism, insisted that the only responsibility a private corporation has is to
its shareholders. i.e. Corporations like Facebook should do whatever it takes to increase the
company’s value to its shareholders, within the boundaries set by law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “social responsibility” of corporations was always a sideshow. It is one that corporations are
compelled to engage in when they come under activist pressure. Some notions of responsibility have
been built into corporations through the “Stakeholder Capitalism” model, which claims that
corporations have responsibility to parties other than their shareholders such as the environment
and society.  This notion has not taken off and I remain unconvinced that this approach will succeed
in the long term. Forcing private corporations to do something &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than make profits and
increase shareholder value seems strange and counter-productive. There are other types of
organizations who are engaged in this kind of activity: Non-profits look out for people who don’t
have a voice. Activists talk to lawmakers about agendas that they care about. Private companies are
not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; supposed to be activists or anything other than profit-making corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate non-profit is the Government. Governments have always been about
&lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt;. (“Everyone” as in the people who are being governed and not being deliberately excluded
due to discrimination.) One of the government’s jobs is to put the right amount of regulation in
place, so that innovation continues unhampered, while citizens can live full, satisfying lives. When
private corporations become as big as Facebook and Google, the government’s power does not &lt;em&gt;simply&lt;/em&gt;
vanish. The power held by governments is special and can not be taken away by anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any country’s government can &lt;strong&gt;legally require&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook to stop misinformation on its platform
through these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enact legislation to make Facebook liable for the harms caused due to misinformation shared on
the platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. There is just one step to that process. Once the government starts finding pieces of
misinformation, identifies the tangible harms caused by it, and holds Facebook liable for these
harms, it is in Facebook’s interests to stop the spread of such misinformation. There is no “choice”
or high-minded talk of “social responsibility” here. Facebook’s shareholders will not stand idly by
as governments impose hefty fines on the company for not cracking down on misinformation. Facebook’s
executives will be forced to act (or pretend to act or curb the government’s enforcement action).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realist politics watcher will instinctively oppose this idea: Facebook pumps in a huge amount of
money into the campaigns of people who become part of the legislature and &lt;strong&gt;no politician will enact
legislation against their top campaign donor.&lt;/strong&gt; This problem is not without a solution either:
Campaign finance reform. Anyone can donate unlimited amounts of money to any candidate and remain
completely hidden through organizations which don’t have to publish their donor lists. This was
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colbert_Super_PAC&quot;&gt;proven&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Colbert who did the actual legal paperwork to establish such an organization and
prove that it was possible. (The resulting TV show segment was also funny.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-convenient-scapegoat&quot;&gt;The Convenient Scapegoat&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments like Biden’s recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/us/politics/biden-facebook-social-media-covid.html&quot;&gt;“They are killing people”&lt;/a&gt; are mind-boggling to hear. Mainstream news
outlets have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-has-undermined-vaccination-efforts-nearly-60-all-vaccination-segments-2-week-period&quot;&gt;peddling vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and are arguably perceived as &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt;
reliable than posts by random &lt;em&gt;anti-vaccination campaigners&lt;/em&gt; on Facebook. Given this disconnect
between the various sources of misinformation and the government’s focus on Facebook, it is
important to analyze the timing and the possible ulterior motives for this zeroing in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Misinformation on Facebook has been going on for some time now and anti-vaccination misinformation
has been spreading for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-facebook.html&quot;&gt;a really long time&lt;/a&gt;. Savvy political campaigns, such as the one run by Donald
Trump or those run by the Republican Party’s candidates during the Georgia run-off elections, have
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/09/the-man-behind-trumps-facebook-juggernaut&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; the Facebook ads platform to peddle misleading information about their opponents. These ads
were disguised as political advertising, and Facebook did not take any step to curb this kind of
advertising. (By comparison, Twitter decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/ads-content-policies/political-content.html&quot;&gt;completely ban&lt;/a&gt; political advertising on its
platform.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary reason that I found the Biden administration’s witch-hunt of Facebook distasteful was
because there is &lt;em&gt;an ongoing search for the convenient scapegoat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Trump was at the helm, Biden did not have to go looking for a scapegoat. Trump made himself
readily available too, Trump thrived on anti-Trump rhetoric, while Biden’s supporters &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to
see him frustrated by Trump’s apparent “childishness” and self-centered approach to crises. They
were in a &lt;em&gt;mutually beneficial relationship&lt;/em&gt;. Trump says something crazy, Biden and other Democrats
say things about him, Trump calls them names, … so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s approach to misinformation has not changed dramatically between the Trump and Biden
presidencies. But Facebook banning Trump from their platform was a dramatic change. In an instant,
they evicted the existing scapegoat. The cage stood empty as the Biden administration struggled to
give the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to 70% of the eligible population. This failure started
a race to fill the cage with a scapegoat once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Misinformation Dozen”, 12 people who are responsible for 65% of all vaccine misinformation in
the US, would have been the obvious choice. But looking at their combined base of followers, it is
obvious why they did not make the &lt;em&gt;cut&lt;/em&gt;. Even at the peak of their popularity, they had 15 million
followers and 62 active accounts. With a population upwards of 300 million, I can understand why
most people would be suspicious if the administration tried to blame a group with direct access to
less than 5% of the total population&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have one final criticism of the administration’s stance. As it has railed against Facebook, they
have repeatedly &lt;em&gt;asked&lt;/em&gt; for information &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; Facebook. But these requests seem to be
non-binding. The administration, undoubtedly, has the ability to open investigations, subpoena
documents and data directly from Facebook. Publishing this information is key to Biden’s argument
about Facebook being responsible for the stalled vaccination campaign. But to do that,
time-consuming work that (even) Biden’s party colleagues are probably unwilling to take up is a
necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measured approach of compelling Facebook to share information, publicizing it and then,
(finally) placing blame, requires work that lawmakers would forgo. Sensational comments are just as
effective in the court of public opinion and can rile up supporters against the chosen
scapegoat&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-has-undermined-vaccination-efforts-nearly-60-all-vaccination-segments-2-week-period&quot;&gt;Media Matters report&lt;/a&gt; about the vaccine misinformation claims on Fox News is worth reading. Here’s the topline from the summary: “In the 2 weeks from June 28 2021 to July 11 2021, 57% of 129 segments about the COVID-19 vaccines had claims that undermined immunization efforts. 45% of segments included claims that the vaccination drive is coercive or that it represents government outreach. 37% of segments included claims that the vaccines are unnecessary or dangerous.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;These 15 million followers are the tip of an iceberg whose real size is unknown. The followers are bound to be members of groups and probably share content from the Misinformation Dozen amplifying the content’s reach to several million more people. Facebook is (understandably) unwilling to share this information voluntarily. The Biden administration is (inexplicably) unwilling to force Facebook to share this information through legislative or judicial pressure. Blaming 12 people is simply not viable. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I admit that on seeing a news article saying that the Biden administration was compelling Facebook to share data, I would not have written a post like this one. My guess is that Opinion desks would have written &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; but this reaction would not have generated half the news headlines that the sensational comments did. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Monthly Recommendations (June 2021)</title>
   <link href="/2021/06/30/monthly-recommendations-2021-june"/>
   <updated>2021-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/06/30/monthly-recommendations-2021-june</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month’s theme is disorder, dishonesty and dysfunction. In that spirit, this month’s list
includes the story of a missionary dabbling in things that she should probably have stayed far away
from, the profile of a Trump administration operative who was an exceptionally bad manager and
irritated nearly everyone whom he worked with, a list of the winners of the recent absurdity in the
US stock markets and how it has helped those who got in early reap huge benefits by selling what
&lt;em&gt;basically&lt;/em&gt; amounts to snake-oil, and, a contemporary historical study of how hot-button topics on
the Internet have evolved over the past 2 decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Son’s Story (Zapana)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/13/texts-from-my-father-in-elmhurst-hospital&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/OUmKi&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 13th April, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There is a terrible desensitization in the way that the newscasters switch from the number of
people who died yesterday to how a team won a sporting match without missing a beat or giving the
audience any time to recover from the previous story. A common argument for this is that people
can’t be bogged down by every bad story that they hear on the news because then they will be
unable to function; lest they be overwhelmed by the amount of bad things that are going on
simultaneously around the world, the audience must be protected through this &lt;em&gt;desensitization&lt;/em&gt;,
some argue. This essay runs against the grain and tells the heart wrenching story of a death in
the family.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Stephen Miller Manipulates Trump to Further His Immigration Obsession (Blitzer)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/02/how-stephen-miller-manipulates-donald-trump-to-further-his-immigration-obsession&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/ATksn&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), 2nd March, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The former President of America, Donald Trump, had a “crazy clown posse” of henchmen and
assistants. Some of these people were people like John Bolton who had an agenda and were working
with Trump only because he was a tool to get that agenda done. Stephen Miller, on the other hand,
was a new animal who could exist &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; in the world where his boss was someone who did not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/trump-doesnt-read-and-skips-written-intelligence-report-unlike-past-presidents-802455&quot;&gt;read
briefings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/chaotic-west-wing-sidney-powell-donald-trump-68b9f15c-bf6d-46db-9cbb-4c9f47475985.html&quot;&gt;allowed&lt;/a&gt; meetings to turn into shouting matches. The part about Miller wanting
things to be done incredibly quickly, even if they were not done properly enough (legislatively)
to withstand future legal challenges and to last long, was an interesting real-world example of
why “move fast, break things” is a bad idea. His constant berating of the people that he met with
seems like a managerial tactic to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The SPAC King Is Doing Just Fine Even as the Bubble Starts to Burst (Faux)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;US stock markets have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME&quot;&gt;crazy&lt;/a&gt; in the past few months. One of the other weird bubbles that has
come up during that time has been the “Special Purpose Acquisition Company”, or “SPAC”,
bubble. Levine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-06-04/bill-ackman-s-spac-will-be-three-spacs?sref=1kJVNqnU&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; what they are and how they work. This article is about the SPAC king
“Chamath”, a megalomaniac, Elon Musk-type character who started appearing on everyone’s YouTube
feeds and gained a lot of popularity in early 2021 when he started saying things like “Venture
capitalists are conning everyone” and “Warren Buffet is not relevant, I am the new Buffet” and
became a folk hero to the &lt;em&gt;stonks&lt;/em&gt; traders. I am not sure how he got all this attention in a
short period of time. He was one of the first few people to turn the SPAC concept into a bubble
which would mint money for anyone who “got in early”. This article is about how he has come out
on top, despite making deals with companies that have &lt;em&gt;questionable&lt;/em&gt; viability and that almost
everyone else is losing money on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mission (Levy)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A fascinating recounting of the story of a woman who goes to Uganda and works as a missionary
there. She works in the health sector and begins treating people. But then, children suffering
from malnutrition start dying. Questions are asked about what she is doing and how she is so
closely connected to so many deaths. Her intentions appear to be good and it is impossible to
parse out what was really going on from this article. It is a good portrayal of the cutthroat
nature of communities of &lt;em&gt;do-gooders&lt;/em&gt; in lower-income economics that seem to have personal enmity
and ego clashes in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The concept of a “culture war” has seeped into the mainstream now. There has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt;
discussion about how the conservative pundit leans on culture wars to generalize a single event
and taint how a religious or ethnic group is seen by the majority. There has also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://observer.com/2016/02/the-totalitarian-doctrine-of-social-justice-warriors/&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; about
how liberals wage culture wars against people by focusing on a wide variety of past oppression
and inter-sectional identities, ensuring that everyone is uncertain about whether they are the
oppressor or the oppressed in a given situation, and consequently, much to the liberals’ delight,
everyone is walking on eggshells. Neither of those positions is completely true or completely
false. It helps to look at the culture wars that have been waged on the Internet. Using some word
frequency plots and his general knowledge of the Internet blogosphere’s history, Alexander shows
that the extremely popular topics of a few years ago have been relegated to &lt;em&gt;lame&lt;/em&gt; and
uninteresting (the “I am so rich I dress in leisurewear when I go to a high-end restaurant”
attitude).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>More Access Leads to Better Governance</title>
   <link href="/2021/06/28/access-and-governance"/>
   <updated>2021-06-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/06/28/access-and-governance</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s the &lt;strong&gt;noble lie&lt;/strong&gt; about democracy: The electorate holds the ruling party accountable for their
actions during the next election. This is taught in classrooms and in political science courses; it
is drilled into the minds of children who have the good fortune of growing up in a liberal
democracy. The truth is revealed when they realize that the electorate is unwilling or unable to
hold the ruling party accountable and that the ruling party is able to entice the electorate with
populist schemes that are announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-government-announces-gold-loan-waiver-hours-before-poll-dates-2379180&quot;&gt;hours before campaigning begins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There is a tedious and
disheartening conversation about why no country has realized this ideal state of democracy in
practice or been able to stay in that state for a long period of time; a conversation that would
identify the media, political self-interest and capitalism as a few of the causes. This post does
&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; engage in that conversation. Instead, I focus on a core component of this system which would
hold the noble lie up: &lt;strong&gt;Access&lt;/strong&gt; to public services such as education, healthcare, and a competent
local government. I contend that widening access is the &lt;strong&gt;silver bullet&lt;/strong&gt; which will allow countries
to reach the ideal state of democracy and maintain that state in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-noble-lie&quot;&gt;The Noble Lie&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the lie in some more detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The electorate votes for a political party every few years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The elected political party forms a government and works for the welfare of a majority of the people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the next election comes along, the political party campaigns on their credentials. Namely,
the changes they brought about in society during their term in office and their plan for the
future, as documented in their election manifesto&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The electorate hears all this rhetoric and looks &lt;em&gt;objectively&lt;/em&gt; at the government’s performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the voting booth, the electorate holds the government &lt;em&gt;accountable&lt;/em&gt; for their actions during
their past term, by voting for either the same party, signaling that they did a good job, or for
the opposition party, signaling that they did not live up to the electorate’s expectations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the ruling party loses, then they go back to the drawing board and await the next election&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whichever party lost the election will become the new opposition and will keep a close eye on
what the government does. They will find counter-arguments to every policy that the ruling party
puts forth, and this is an important part of the electorate’s opinion forming process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GOTO&lt;/code&gt; Step (1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least one of the above steps is broken in all of today’s liberal democracies&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step (2) has never &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; worked. The government is focused on winning the next election and does
what will work out best for their current and potential supporters; not bothering too much with the
ardent supporters of the opposition party. The stickiness of political ideologies supports this
approach. If one were to assume a utilitarian point-of-view, the limited resources that the
government has access to &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be used to safeguard their path to office in future election
cycles. There have been a handful of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYbY45rHj8w&quot;&gt;astonishingly selfless&lt;/a&gt; politicians, such as those inside the
conservative party in Australia who implemented gun control at the cost of their political futures
following a mass shooting. These politicians are the exceptions that prove the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step (4) is universally broken. The electorate learns about what the government has done through the
media and the media is regulated by the government. This is a conflict of interest for the
government. Media organizations have their own ideal state which they have not achieved and the
failure to live up to the requirements of step (4) are the result of knock-on effects of dependent
systems, each of which is far from its ideal state. I have written about &lt;a href=&quot;/news/journalism/media/critique/2021/03/13/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites-1-motivation-and-methodology/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/journalism/critique/2021/05/08/journalism-without-context/&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/news/series/2018/07/30/news-media-expectations-1/&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step (5) is broken in countries where the government has expansive, unchecked powers over
spending. In effect, the government is empowered to bribe the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_voter_theorem&quot;&gt;median voter&lt;/a&gt; through populist
schemes. The government can thus side-step the requirement of “performing” when in office, but still
convince voters on the campaign trail. There are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thehindu.com/news/the-india-cables/lsquoCash-for-votes-a-way-of-political-life-in-South-Indiarsquo/article14949621.ece&quot;&gt;out-of-band methods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; like “Cash for
votes” schemes to convince voters, though owing to their nature these are less frequently
documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step (6) is hard to adhere to for an enterprising political party. The ruling party is unwilling to
reevaluate their policy platform or the changing demography of a country following an election
loss. This refusal to change has lead to endless shouting matches on nightly news shows and
walk-outs from legislative bodies that accomplish absolutely nothing in the Parliamentary system of
governance that exists in India and Britain. It’s utility is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/31/us/politics/texas-voting-bill-.html&quot;&gt;questionable&lt;/a&gt; in separation-of-powers
democracies like America. In an astonishing example from America, the losing side embarked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/podcasts/the-daily/voting-rights-georgia.html&quot;&gt;a
national campaign&lt;/a&gt; to disenfranchise supporters of the winning side in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I will end this inventory of the failures of democracy and move on to my core argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-access-what-are-its-determinants&quot;&gt;What is “Access”? What are it’s Determinants?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Access” is an ambiguous concept and risks becoming a catch-all term. I will define it concretely
for our purposes here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Access is the availability of public services like education, healthcare and a competent local
government. These are things that private individuals can not do as efficiently as the
government. Apart from these enumerated facets of access, we should consider pensions for the
elderly, rations for the poor, opportunities for the unemployed and public transport for all as
essential public services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are two determinants of &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; access someone has during their formative years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Access is heavily impacted by geographical location, with people in urban areas generally
having better access due to the higher per-capita government revenue and the government’s enhanced
ability to recruit talent willing to inhabit these areas. People in rural areas generally have
little or no access to essential services and are often compelled to go considerable distances to
procure them. Anecdotes about Indians walking several kilometers every day to go to school or
college are commonplace even as recently as the 1990s or 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Access is determined by socioeconomic position. The wealthy landowner in a rural area has
the ability to shuttle their children to school or move closer to the school for a period of time,
while everyone else is left behind. Further gradations become visible as children move to higher
levels of education; the entrance exams for several Engineering colleges in India are &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/will-language-barrier-impede-aspirants-success-in-jee-advanced/articleshow/79489211.cms&quot;&gt;held only in
English and Hindi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, creating a major barrier for students who studied in schools where a
regional language was the medium of teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This difference within members of the electorate profoundly impacts what they do as participants in
the democratic system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-is-access-important&quot;&gt;Why is Access Important?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the importance of access, I will break the election process into three separate
stages: the pre-election stage of electoral polls and campaigning, the voting stage, and the
post-election stage of measuring government performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;before-the-election-polling-and-campaigning&quot;&gt;Before the election: Polling and Campaigning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impacts of access at this stage are under-discussed. Political parties use private and public
polling&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to gauge what the electorate &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to hear them talk about. Who gets polled depends
on how much access they have. The most common method for polling in America is calling people up on
telephones. Someone who does not have a telephone is not likely to be polled and their opinion
remains unheard by political parties before the election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In smaller economies and middle-income countries, the problem becomes even bigger. Internet
penetration in India is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/792074/india-internet-penetration-rate/&quot;&gt;about 45%&lt;/a&gt; which reduces the utility of online polls like &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/polls&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at traditional polls like India Today’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiatoday.in/mood-of-the-nation-survey-2020&quot;&gt;Mood of the Nation 2020&lt;/a&gt; poll, we notice the
difference between the country’s literacy rate and the literacy rate of the people who were polled;
while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/literacy-rate&quot;&gt;about 75%&lt;/a&gt; of the people in India were literate in 2018, about 96% of the people polled were
literate. This gap makes the poll &lt;em&gt;less representative&lt;/em&gt; because only 1 out of 5 illiterate people in
India got the opportunity to voice their opinion. The poll’s coverage of the whole country is also
spotty with only 97 of the 543 Lok Sabha constituencies surveyed. This poll is decidedly not the
mood of the nation. Rather, it’s the mood of the people within the nation who have the most amount
of access&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campaigning is less of a problem related to access because political parties campaign in places
where there are &lt;em&gt;persuadable&lt;/em&gt; voters. These places are generally chosen irrespective of the amount
of access they have. A politician will travel as far as they need to if they can get an audience
with a few thousand persuadable voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you (or counterparts in your cohort) are not being polled routinely and diligently, then your
options for getting your opinions to politicians are limited. One potent option which is widely
recommended is to “get involved in local and regional politics” and talk to the politicians who are
closest to you and explain your concerns to them. Each democracy provides it’s own method of
accomplishing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America provides the public forum and town council meetings, whose inefficiency and ineffectiveness
was immortalized by the excellent TV show, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/areUGfOHkMA&quot;&gt;Parks and Recreation&lt;/a&gt;. Decentralized democracy generally
provides multiple levels of politicians starting from a local counselor or panchayat leader (in
towns and villages in India) going up to a member of the state or federal legislature. I think that
this option is mostly touted for &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt;.  People at these levels are impossible to find, meet or
talk to. Their functionaries are equally powerful and (generally) just as absent. Above all, this
assumes that the duty of a citizen extends well beyond voting in an election: If they want to get
their opinions out, they have to find someone who can effect change and proactively tell them about
it. This seems like a dream and is not backed by anything that exists in reality. This ability to be
proactive is again dictated by socioeconomic situation, with people who are well above the poverty
line with more flexibility at their workplace to take time off and meet with the people who
matter&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some caveats to my opposition to this idea. The implementation of democracy has varying
levels of imperfection across the world. Thus, theoretically, it is possible that a democracy
somewhere in the world has really good processes which allow the voice of everyone to be heard. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theprint.in/opinion/this-data-shows-why-indian-mps-dont-truly-represent-their-people/201769/&quot;&gt;At
scale&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t think that &lt;strong&gt;expecting&lt;/strong&gt; citizens to be proactive is acceptable. Incentivising the
government and political parties to employ &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/&quot;&gt;private companies&lt;/a&gt; who do surveys and weight the results
appropriately to represent the whole country sounds like a much better option to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;during-the-election-voting-booth&quot;&gt;During the election: Voting booth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to the voting booth is an important part of democracy that democracies generally do &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;
at. There are few complaints about these. While citizens might struggle to get their voices heard
&lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; an election, when an election comes around, politicians would generally like to lock down
the reliable voters who will vote for them and will be in favor of policies that bring them into the
fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will offer one minor and one major instance where access to the voting booth is systematically
limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minor caveat comes from India. India runs the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWldvqO4AIY&quot;&gt;world’s biggest election&lt;/a&gt; every 5 years. In
&lt;a href=&quot;https://eci.gov.in/files/file/10991-2-highlights/&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, 910 million people were eligible to vote, while 610 million people actually voted,
resulting in a polling percentage of 67%. These votes were cast over 5 weeks to elect 543 Members of
Parliament. These numbers are staggering. The polling percentage in particular is comparable to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/record-high-turnout-in-2020-general-election.html&quot;&gt;American turnout&lt;/a&gt; during the 2020 Presidential election, an older democracy which has several
features for convenient voting such as early voting, mail-in ballots, and same-day registration,
which are missing from the Indian election process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of these convenience features makes it nearly impossible for someone who isn’t close to
their assigned voting booth in an election. For anyone to vote in an Indian election, they must be
registered to vote and have a voting slip. The voting slip specifies the polling booth that has been
assigned and one is required to present oneself at the polling booth, on the assigned day, between 9
am and 5 pm (or a similar time period). This geographical restriction is an annoyance and creates a
bias towards people who stay in the same place for a long time. In an economy that is still largely
agrarian, these concerns are inconsequential&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major instance of systemic denial of access to the voting booth emanates from the politician’s
desire to empower reliable voters who will vote for their party, while simultaneously finding
dubious methods to disenfranchise reliable voters of the opposition party. There are two ways to
deal with reliable opposition voters: persuade them that one’s party will product better outcomes
for them &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; exclude them from the electorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is really nothing more to say about this; if democracy is about convincing the electorate to
vote for you and you are in charge of including and excluding people from the electorate, it makes
complete sense to prevent the people who will not vote for you from being a part of the
electorate. The Republican party in the American South decidedly went over the cliff on this in
early 2021 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/podcasts/the-daily/voting-rights-georgia.html&quot;&gt;wholeheartedly committed&lt;/a&gt; to disenfranchise a large block of voters who turned out for
the opposition in the previous election; their policies have been outrageous and they have not
bothered to even present these policies in a palatable form. This kind of disenfranchisement was
going on in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-4dIImaodQ&quot;&gt;Gerrymandering&lt;/a&gt;, the American process of periodically redrawing districts to
bunch up one’s own supporters into reliable constituencies, while breaking up the opposition’s
supporters into multiple districts ensuring their inability to forge a plurality anywhere. While
that was an obscure form of distorting the electorate’s powers, preventing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/03/04/attacking-sunday-voting-is-part-long-tradition-controlling-black-americans/&quot;&gt;Sunday voting&lt;/a&gt; is a direct
and indefensible form of exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://theprint.in/india/caa-nrc-could-render-huge-numbers-of-indian-muslims-stateless-says-ashutosh-varshney/376008/&quot;&gt;legislative policies&lt;/a&gt; were nearing implementation and were widely protested in December 2019,
before the COVID-19 pandemic forced the government to apply the brakes and focus on a separate
crisis. The Indian government’s determination to implement the various citizenship tests and
registers appears to be undaunted and with 3 years remaining in their current term, it seems
entirely possible that they will implement at least a part of the agenda that they left unfinished
before the next election in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;after-the-election-measuring-government-performance&quot;&gt;After the election: Measuring government performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approval ratings are calculated using surveys that ask people some form of a straightforward
question: “Do you approve of the current government’s performance?”. By keeping the question simple,
they aim to capture the public’s approval of the job that a government is doing, implicitly assuming
that the public will take into consideration all the various things happening in the country. It is
a purposefully coarse metric which tells people about the present. It is not very helpful in the
long run, except for direct comparisons between different leaders (even in comparison, the usage of
approval numbers is suspect because of the differing conditions that a leader has to deal with when
they come into office).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://morningconsult.com/form/global-leader-approval/#section-56&quot;&gt;Morning Consult&lt;/a&gt;’s weekly poll gives us some idea of the approval ratings for leaders around the
world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/morning-consult-global-leader-approval.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology of the survey determines the final number and different numbers can be found for
&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating&quot;&gt;America&lt;/a&gt; on FiveThirtyEight’s approval poll average and for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhk.or.jp/senkyo/shijiritsu/&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; on NHK, the state broadcaster’s
monthly survey of about 2000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers can be easily goosed and have wide short-term variations. For instance, when Modi, the
Prime Minister of India, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a nationwide lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in March
2020, the 7-day moving average of his net approval shot up from 52% on March 21st (3 days before the
announcement) to 63% on March 27th (3 days after the announcement). This increase is not meaningful,
as the effects of the lockdown were not visible in that short period. When the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/asia/coronavirus-india-migrants.html&quot;&gt;disastrous effects&lt;/a&gt; of
the lockdown became apparent, the net approval returned to it’s original level around 53% in June
2020, nearly 3 months after the initial announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring the Government’s performance is a tricky task for any citizen. Access plays a pivotal role
in this; specifically, the citizen’s access to information, their ability to process this
information, and their ability to come to an independent conclusion (free of peer pressure and
intimidation). All these facets of access are determined by the amenities available in her
neighborhood in the present and the opportunities she was able to avail in childhood. People who are
illiterate or physically challenged have been systemically excluded from the information ecosystem,
although the advent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/TiP7aantnvE&quot;&gt;accessibility tools&lt;/a&gt; such as screen readers and platforms such as YouTube with
content in several regional languages is gradually filling this access gap. We should be cautious in
becoming too optimistic though as access to the Internet is far from perfect, &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data&quot;&gt;some
advanced economics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free and good quality primary and secondary education is also facing several obstacles and on this
front, there is a wide gap between various countries. When one looks at the amount of time that
schools and other educational institutions were asked to stop functioning during the COVID-19
pandemic, I think one can gauge a government’s attitude towards the education of their
citizens. While schools remained closed in America and India for several months, Japan and France
rushed to open their schools as soon as the first waves of the pandemic ended and doctors were able
to understand the disease better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/schools-arent-superspreaders/616669/&quot;&gt;evidence mounted&lt;/a&gt; showing that the spread of the disease in schools is limited and can be
curtailed using common-sense measures such as masks and social distancing, some countries responded
by implementing these measures and reopening schools, while others decided to forget about them due
to upcoming elections. The Indian government went &lt;a href=&quot;https://zeenews.india.com/india/cbse-cisce-board-exams-2021-cancelled-here-are-top-5-updates-2365981.html&quot;&gt;one step further&lt;/a&gt; and canceled the year-end exams
for CBSE, a nationwide education board, impacting 15 million students who were to take these exams
in April 2021. The exams were canceled without any clues about what their replacements will look
like and the whole thing was a huge communication failure which left a lot of students anxious about
both the near- and long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These decisions were made at different points during the pandemic and support for them is divided
among the electorate. I don’t know of any poll that has asked people about their opinions on how
important it is to open restaurants and movie theaters compared to opening schools. The Economic
Survey in 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the drop-out rate in secondary education in India (age 10 to 17) to be
about 19.89%. This number is bound to have increased during the pandemic. It is a near certainty
that the past year of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-21/coronavirus-school-closures-will-hurt-kids-and-worsen-inequality&quot;&gt;school closures will increase social inequality&lt;/a&gt; in the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This is probably a pessimistic view, an overstatement and a simplification of the nuanced reality. But the inaccuracy of this statement is well within the tolerances that I have set myself for evaluating the performance of a democracy. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;For this post, I consider polling to be the systematic science of calling up probable voters and asking them questions, in order to gauge the public’s opinion on social, political and economic issues. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have made some assumptions here. Namely, I have assumed that this poll covers the easiest places to survey: urban and semi-urban places where access to telephony is high and people are reachable by various modes of communication. The names or economic attributes (such as the median income of the polled constituencies) of the 97 constituencies that were polled are not available in the “Methodology” section of the poll. Given this lack of information, I have decided to &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; give the benefit of the doubt to the polling agency, because they have not explained their weighting of the survey results or whether they have employed statistical processes to deal with minor inaccuracies in surveys or the differences between the sample’s population and the country’s population. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_(2012_film)&quot;&gt;Shanghai (2012)&lt;/a&gt;, an Indian movie, is a good reference for learning more about how the bureaucracy works in India. The New York Times podcast series, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/nice-white-parents&quot;&gt;Nice White Parents&lt;/a&gt;, is a good example of how a motivated group of people, with a lot of time and willingness on their hands, can bend the system’s rules to favor themselves and their group. A deeper discussion of both these works will not fit in this (already quite long) post, and I decided to drop them and focus on the core argument here. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:7&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Notes and Review - Anna Karenina (Tolstoy)</title>
   <link href="/2021/06/23/anna-karenina-review"/>
   <updated>2021-06-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/06/23/anna-karenina-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anna Karenina is a love story. Reading this book has shown me the source of several scenes from
iconic romantic movies: Lovers meeting in a railway station, rejection at dinners, and heartbroken
characters traveling abroad attempting to heal their soul. Tolstoy’s descriptions of people and
their interactions with each other were more compelling to me than his descriptions of natural
scenes. This preference is probably related to my (current) personal preference for stories which
have interesting characters doing unpredictable things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tolstoy has written beautiful characters in Anna Karenina. These characters are complex and
relatable, despite having been written about 140 years ago. They are infuriating and lovable, and my
attitude towards them changed as swiftly as the word they had spoken reached the listener’s
ears. These characters have basic recognizable characteristics: love, fear, contempt, dreams, and
anxieties. The description of Anna, Vronsky, and Levin is &lt;em&gt;exquisite&lt;/em&gt;. Listening to them talk
throughout the book, I have a good idea of what each of them would look like and how they would
react in a new situation. Their descriptions are often through the eyes of their lovers and the
inherent biases of this perception are a challenge to parse out (For example, I felt that the way
people in society described Anna’s appearances was at odds with the way Vronsky describes Anna).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that Tolstoy gives the reader a very narrow window into the character’s true feelings. A
character’s thought is framed in an extremely long sentence, which reveals the character’s true
feelings near its culmination. The use of pronouns can often be confusing and can lead to confusion
about whom (or what) the character is referring to when they say “them” (or “it”). This technique is
used in a scene in which a professional artist, Mikhailov, visits Vronsky, a budding unskilled
painter who is infatuated with art for the time-being. Here’s what Mikhailov has to say after
looking at Vronsky’s painting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One cannot forbid a person from making himself a big wax doll and kissing it. But if this person
were to come with his doll, sit down in front of a man in love, and begin caressing his doll in the
way a man in love caresses his beloved, the man in love would find it distasteful. Mikhailov
experienced the same kind of unpleasant sensation when he saw Vronsky’s painting: he found it
ridiculous, and annoying, and pathetic, and offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What starts out ostensibly as an admission of the various forms of art, becomes a scathing criticism
of people who engage in art as a &lt;strong&gt;hobby&lt;/strong&gt; and ends as a dramatic take-down of Vronsky’s art. I can
empathize with Mikhailov’s feelings of distaste while simultaneously feeling some sympathy towards
Vronsky and respect for the effort he has put into his painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Tolstoy applies this technique adeptly when characters express their displeasure with someone
they are &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be in love with, he also uses it to show the duality of love. Once again, the
description of love between two characters as described by the man in the relationship (I have
removed the names of the characters to prevent spoilers about the story’s trajectory):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The preoccupation she had with small details, which was so at odds with his ideal of sublime
happiness in the early days, was one of his disenchantments; but this endearing preoccupation, the
point of which he could not understand but which he could not help loving was one of his new
enchantments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preoccupation that this woman has with “small details” is a disenchantment, an enchantment,
inexplicable and endearing to the man; all at once. One would be hard pressed to conclude anything
about how the character really feels. Tolstoy has succeeded at keeping the reader guessing about how
the character truly feels towards his lover (The reader suspects that the man is hopelessly in love
with the woman and is trying to explain away some inconvenient details about her that he is unable
to accept; it might also be true that the man is actually at the edge of his patience with the
woman; there is no way to resolve this doubt for we see only a short period of the two characters’
lives together).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read Rosamund Bartlett’s English translation of the book and there were several references to the
characters switching effortlessly between French and Russian throughout the book. This book was
written in the late 1800s and the dominance of English as the language of the elite classes was not
yet cemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-advise-for-future-readers-of-anna-karenina&quot;&gt;My advise for future readers of Anna Karenina&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have three pieces of advise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend about 30-45 minutes on the introduction, familiarizing yourself with the way Russian names
are structured and how characters switch between various forms of address depending on their
intimacy with the person being addressed. Doing this helped me go through the rest of the book
without having to think about how Stiva and Oblonsky are the same person and what it means for
him to be referred to using either.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep a record of how you feel about a character after having known them for a while and track
their evolution and how you feel about them throughout the book. It would be impossible for me to
say that I love or hate any character; I can definitely say that I started out loving Karenin
(Anna’s husband) and ended up finding his weak-mindedness disgusting. It’s very interesting to
explore your feelings about this person and track the changes after having read the book and
forming an opinion of them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a video like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jkp_COBtH3w&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; to decide which translation to read. I don’t think it matters what
translation you read as all of them are probably closer than one thinks and a first-time reader
(like myself) could hardly have told the difference anyway. Watching a video and scoring the
translations in a blind &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt; test on expression of images, simplicity of language, and overall
score, helped me choose an edition and get on with the hard part: &lt;strong&gt;reading the novel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;people-who-work-for-the-common-good&quot;&gt;People who work for the common good&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Konstantin Levin regarded his brother as a man of immense intellect and education, who was noble in
the highest sense of that word, and endowed with an ability to work for the common good. But in the
depths of his soul, the older he became, and the better he got to know his brother, the more
frequently it occurred to him that this ability to work for the common good, which he felt he lacked
totally, was perhaps not a virtue but, on the contrary, a deficiency of something—not a deficiency
of good, honest, noble desires and tastes, but a deficiency of life force, the thing which is called
heart, the impulse which drives a person to choose one of the innumerable life paths open to him and
stick to it. The more he discovered about his brother, the more he noticed that Sergey Ivanovich,
and many other people who worked for the common good, were not drawn with their hearts to this love
of the common good, but had worked out in their minds that this was a good cause, and took it up for
that reason alone. The observation that his brother did not take the question of the common good or
the immortality of the soul any more to heart than he did a game of chess or the ingenious
construction of a new machine only served to confirm Levin’s hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;life-and-death&quot;&gt;Life and Death&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Death, the inevitable end of everything, confronted him for the first time with irresistible
force. And this death, which was there, in this beloved brother, groaning in his sleep and from
force of habit indiscriminately invoking first God then the devil, was not nearly as remote as it
had seemed to him before. It was in him too—he could feel it. If not today, then tomorrow, and if
not tomorrow, then in thirty years—did it really matter when? But what this inevitable death was, he
not only did not know and had never thought about, but also did not feel competent or bold enough to
think about.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He sat hunched up on his bed in the darkness, with his arms around his knees, and thought, holding
his breath from all the concentration. But the more he concentrated, the more apparent it became to
him that this was unmistakably the case, that he really had forgotten, overlooked, one small factor
in life—that death would come along and everything would end, that it was not worth even starting
anything, and there was no way this could be helped. Yes, it was awful, but that is how it was. ‘But
I am still alive. So what should I do now, what exactly should I do?’ he said with desperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;marriage&quot;&gt;Marriage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;She was both appalled by this indifference and thrilled by what had caused it. She could not
conceive of or wish for anything beyond life with this man; but this new life did not yet exist, and
she could not even picture it clearly in her mind. There was only anticipation—fear and joy of the
new and unknown. And now, in just a few moments, the anticipation, the unknown, and the remorse at
renouncing her old life was about to come to an end, and something new would begin. This new thing
could not but be frightening as it was unknown; but frightening or not, it had already taken place
six weeks earlier in her soul; today they were merely sanctifying what had happened a long time ago
in her soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--quoteend--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When, as a bachelor he used to observe other people’s married life, their petty worries, quarrels,
and jealousy, he would just smile contemptuously in his soul. He was convinced that not only could
there be nothing of that sort in his future married life, but he also believed that it would be
completely and utterly unlike the life of other people even in all its outward forms. And instead of
that, he suddenly found that not only had his life with his wife not formed into something special,
but, on the contrary, was entirely formed of those same trifling details which he had so despised
before, but which were now against his will acquiring an extraordinary and unassailable
significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jealousy&quot;&gt;Jealousy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And jealousy of him led her to resenting him [her lover] and seeking grounds for her resentment in
everything. She blamed him for everything that was difficult about her situation. The agonizing
state of suspense between heaven and earth which she had to endure in Moscow, her husband’s slowness
and indecision, her isolation—she put it all down to him [her lover]. If he [her lover] had loved
her, he would have understood all the difficulty of her situation and extricated her from it. And he
was the one to blame for the fact that she was living in Moscow and not in the country. He could not
live buried in the country as she would have liked. He needed society, and he had put her in this
dreadful situation, the difficulty of which he did not want to understand. And he was likewise to
blame for the fact that she was forever separated from her son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;war&quot;&gt;War&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Alphonse Karr* expressed it very well before the war with Prussia: “You consider war is necessary?
Excellent. Whoever preaches war should join a special front-line legion and lead the assault into
the attack in front of everyone else!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;beware-spoilers-ahead&quot;&gt;Beware, Spoilers Ahead&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following two sections of the review &lt;strong&gt;contain spoilers&lt;/strong&gt;. These spoilers will reduce the suspense
in some parts of the book and reveal the trajectory of the story (such as who ends up with whom). If
you plan to read Anna Karenina in the future (and I recommend that you do!), I would advise you to
&lt;strong&gt;not read any further&lt;/strong&gt; and dive straight into the novel instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/beware-of-the-bear.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;iconic-scenes&quot;&gt;Iconic Scenes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The railway station scene in which Vronsky meets Anna as she emerges from the train and he is
entering the compartment, is perhaps the most iconic scene. There are other scenes which I found
touching. I liked each of the following scenes for their ability to build suspense in the reader’s
mind and hold the reader’s attention by conveying the raw emotion felt by the characters involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anna and Vronsky at the derby:&lt;/strong&gt; Vronsky’s visit to the place where Anna is staying at to declare
his love for her; Anna’s disregard for Karenin’s presence at the derby; her unveiled anxiety for
Vronsky and her hope of his victory at the horse race. This scene’s suspense builds to a stunning
climax. My heart &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; inexplicably racing and I wanted to quickly absorb as much of the scene as
possible and get to the conclusion and see how each of the characters fared&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anna’s reunion with her son Seryozha:&lt;/strong&gt; Anna returns to her home to meet her son Seryozha
in the morning. She is let in by the maids and housekeepers who work in the house and she goes to
his room and waits for him to wake up. When he finally does, they have the most touching reunion
that I have ever read. This scene was a &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; expression of the tender love that exists
between a parent and a child. Anna’s parting words to Seryozha are packed with pain and
emotion. The writing is amazingly articulate. Anna implores Seryozha to love his father and she
says to him that she has wronged his father. But it is also easy to perceive that she knows that
Seryozha will never love his father as much as she loves her. Seryozha’s father, Karenin’s
attitude towards his son is a stark contrast to the emotion that Anna shows in this scene&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Levin’s marriage:&lt;/strong&gt; Levin’s marriage was another particularly good section of the book. Levin’s
marriage to Kitty is described over multiple chapters and the things that Levin says during the
preparation for his marriage and on the day of his marriage feel extremely normal and close to
reality. In particular, on the day of his marriage, Levin is in the hilarious predicament of not
having a new shirt to wear to his wedding. The procurement of this shirt takes an unreasonably
long time as his butler has to unpack his clothes suitcases and get the shirt back to where he
is. During this short period of time, Levin, Kitty and everyone else impatiently waiting for the
wedding to begin at a church feel the general anxiety that accompanies big events in someone’s
life. This description of anxiety is helpful and I will return to these sections of the book in
the future&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Levin throwing Vesolvsky out of his house:&lt;/strong&gt; Veslovsky is an old friend of Levin’s wife,
Kitty. He arrives in their house for a hunting trip and stays a couple days during which he
shamelessly flirts with Kitty. This irks Levin no end, and eventually he decides to throw
Vesolvsky out of his house. Having been completely irritated by Vesolvsky’s antics up until that
point, seeing him be thrown out of the house was a lot of fun and very rewarding (considering the
anxiety I felt about Levin and Kitty’s relationship after this fool had meddled in it).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Levin and Kitty at Levin’s brother Nikolay’s death bed:&lt;/strong&gt; Levin visits Nikolay’s death bed after
getting a telegram from Nikolay’s lover telling him that his brother is sick. After some
deliberation, Kitty convinces Levin that she &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; accompany him to his brother’s
deathbed. Levin’s initial frustration with Kitty’s insistence and his perception of this
insistence as &lt;em&gt;selfishness&lt;/em&gt; in not wanting to be left alone is perplexing. When the two of them
arrive at the location where Nikolay is staying, Kitty is the exact opposite of Levin: She takes
control of things and does things to make Nikolay more comfortable; while Levin is paralyzed by
the state that he finds his brother in and is unable to think of what to say or do. Levin admires
Kitty’s presence of mind as she goes about talking endlessly with Nikolay and making him
comfortable in the final few days of his life by cleaning the room and improving the environment
that his brother lay in. I have felt awkward and out-of-place (much like Levin) in similar
situations and admired people (like Kitty) in my life who are not afraid of death and can do the
things that are required, without regard for the long-term philosophical consequences which Levin
and I use to explain our inaction and paralysis. &lt;strong&gt;This scene showed me the ideal to aspire to as
a compassionate friend or relative&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A coworker pointed out to me that Levin’s attitude towards Kitty in this section, when he says
things like “While Kitty can’t say half as much about death as me, she understood it and was
not afraid of it”, was condescending. I found this attitude to be a defense mechanism that
Levin was using to justify his ineptitude in the face of a distressing situation. But I can’t
find a good argument against my coworker’s conception of the scene and I feel obliged to put
it here&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The same coworker also pointed out to me that the repeated talk of “masculine independence”
whenever the female characters in the book express their desire to spend time with their
husbands shows that Tolstoy was not more progressive than the average person of the era that
he lived in&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;characters&quot;&gt;Characters&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the book, Levin was the character I identified with the most. He is similar in age and
temperament to me. He seems to be based on Tolstoy with some of Tolstoy’s hobbies attributed to
Levin towards the end of the book (Tolstoy’s first name is “Lev”). While this similarity in age is
important to me, as I get older, I wonder whether I will continue to related with Levin but simply
think of him as my “past self” rather than as my “present self”, as I did on this reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the three main male characters in the book, Karenin and Levin, have similar childhoods; they
were both orphans with ambition, who did not have a lot of friends and had a craving for
independence and the confidence that comes from having earned everything they possessed. Karenin’s
“glacial confidence” when contrasted with the Vronsky’s nervous youthful energy was a confrontation
I would liked to have seen more of (They meet only a handful of times).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oblonsky is another character who is, in turn, hilarious, annoying and infuriating. At one point,
when Oblonsky and Levin are out hunting, Oblonsky advises Levin to safeguard his “masculine
independence” after he sees Levin writing back to Kitty and feeling anxious about a short 2-day
separation from Kitty. He (I believe rightly) points out that Levin’s anxiety over such short
periods of separation is unsustainable. I don’t know if what Oblonsky says is true for I have not
had a similar experience to him or Levin. I can only speculate here: Levin’s anxiety felt normal and
acceptable. Unsurprisingly, Oblonsky gives similar advice to Vronsky. Oblonsky is the essential link
between Karenin, Vronsky and Levin, who rarely meet throughout the book, despite having the symbolic
connection of being the male protagonists of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Karenin, Anna’s husband, I felt a dull disgust and repulsion towards the end of the book. I
started out liking Karenin and even feeling sorry for him; but after Oblonsky’s meeting with
Karenin, the Countess and a clairvoyant in St. Petersburg, I could only see how weak minded he
really was&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. His conduct towards his son Seryozha does not inspire, while Seryozha’s confusion
at his only remaining parent’s detachment is heart breaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Vronsky, I felt contempt at his apparent entitlement and incredulity at his shifting nature. His
love for Anna is human for he feels it strongly but still wants some distance for his own
pursuits. Anna’s love for Vronsky is never ending and is defined by the reality that Vronsky has all
the power in their relationship, both in her mind and in society’s opinion of their transgression;
when they return to St. Petersburg, Vronsky goes out to the theater but implores Anna to not
accompany him for fear of her “being disgraced”. Anna goes nevertheless and what Vronsky feared ends
up happening. This section was not in vain because Vronsky comes to the stunning realization that
the doors of elite society have closed for Anna and there was precious little he could do; I felt
sympathy for this Vronsky. Right after, Vronsky shows that, as cavalier he might portray himself to
his friends, he &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; this elite society in his daily life. And for that Vronsky, I felt only
pity, for he knew not what he had, in a lover as devoted as Anna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, for Anna, I felt a mix of love, hate, and pity. It would be accurate to say that I felt
every possible emotion towards her character because she changes significantly during each phase of
her life depicted in the book. Her initial introduction and her time with Kitty is charming; her
time outside Russia paints her as impatient and &lt;em&gt;needy&lt;/em&gt;; her time back in Russia enhances her
inability to understand the realities of her new position in society. The way she lashes out at
Vronsky and her friend Princess Betsy shows the petty parts of her nature. Eventually, she becomes
paranoid and obsesses over unanswered notes that she &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; have not yet reached her lover,
Vronsky. Anna ends up terribly, terribly alone. Consequently, Vronsky stares down the barrel of a
similar fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My notes from when I was reading the book are rather harsh towards Karenin. After the Oblonsky meeting: “That he acted the way he did in front of Oblonsky was a fucking disgrace - You are pathetic, Karenin”. &lt;em&gt;Rather&lt;/em&gt; harsh. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <id>/2021/05/31/monthly-recommendations-2021-may</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month, we deal with the recent past. The recommendations include the profile of a digital
marketer, which looks back at how Trump’s 2016 campaign used the tools at their disposal effectively
to achieve something the &lt;em&gt;mainstream&lt;/em&gt; strongly believed was impossible, an article about the
disastrous effects of healthcare systems being optimized for efficiency and the steps we can take to
avoid them, and how loneliness might be one of those truly new and modern problems which time
travelers would be unable to explain to their relatively temporally close counterparts in the late
1700s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Man Behind Trump’s Facebook Juggernaut (Marantz)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/09/the-man-behind-trumps-facebook-juggernaut&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/LoyBJ&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), March 9, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is a profile of Brad Parscale, a digital marketer with no political experience, who worked
on Trump’s 2016 campaign and used Facebook effectively to do things that neither Facebook nor the
mainstream thought were useful, possible or impactful enough to decide elections. He proved them
wrong by diligently looking for the things that were possible within Facebook’s tools for
Advertisers and trying everything. Noteworthy among the strategies that he employed was one which
required campaign event attendees to enter their phone numbers to get free tickets. This data was
then uploaded to Facebook as a spreadsheet and Facebook used the data in their databases to
create a list of users who were similar to campaign event attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What The Coronavirus Crisis Reveals About American Medicine (Mukherjee)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/04/what-the-coronavirus-crisis-reveals-about-american-medicine&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/ncFxf&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), May 4, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Efficient systems are great: They are the holy grail of capitalism. The inefficiently used
resource is detrimental to your bottom line. Healthcare is not a capitalistic endeavor
though. So, when hospitals, schools, nursing homes, and kindergartens are run using these
principles of least resource wastage, they are less resilient to &lt;strong&gt;major crises&lt;/strong&gt;. This article is
not a rant; It looks &lt;strong&gt;forward&lt;/strong&gt; in a useful way. It is not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a survey of the problems that
were in the system which lead to the disastrous outcomes in America last year; there are a lot of
suggestions about what &lt;em&gt;we should do&lt;/em&gt;. This article is focused on the American healthcare
system. The Indian healthcare system is no different: Private players make up most of the market
and insurance coverage is very low (in this regard, the Indian system is in a worst state than
America, where coverage has expanded in the past decade). As India’s insurance market grows and
more people get insurance, hospitals and the government have a good opportunity to side-step &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/tYrKubNUtVk&quot;&gt;bad
outcomes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The History of Loneliness (Lepore)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/06/the-history-of-loneliness&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/6gckG&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), April 6, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;During the feudal era, loneliness was unheard of. During the Victorian era, even the wealthiest
people had no privacy and were surrounded by housemaids and cooks who hovered around
incessantly&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Lepore argues that there has been a paradigm shift in society.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Before modern times, very few human beings lived alone. Slowly, beginning not much more than a
century ago, that changed. In the United States, more than one in four people now lives alone; in
some parts of the country, especially big cities, that percentage is much higher. You can live alone
without being lonely, and you can be lonely without living alone, but the two are closely tied
together, which makes lockdowns, sheltering in place, that much harder to bear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I am &lt;a href=&quot;/take/history/covid19/2021/02/12/the-previous-year-take/&quot;&gt;suspicious&lt;/a&gt; of phrases like “paradigm shift”. Lepore does an incredible job at putting forth
a convincing argument though. Measurable loneliness has increased in the past few years and this
article gives the historical context which was missing from Vox’ excellent video on the topic,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EidKI1Bdons&quot;&gt;Why Are We So Lonely?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Untold Story of How Jeff Bezos Beat the Tabloids (Stone)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-05-05/how-jeff-bezos-beat-the-tabloids-the-untold-story-of-money-sex-and-power&quot;&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/RB2Zs&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), May 5, 2021&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Say you own a leading newspaper and are famous and powerful enough for people to believe you and
go out on a limb to do favors for you. Further, say that you are hit with a scandal that
threatens to take away some of the wind from your sail and reduce you to a mere human. What do
you do? Jeff Bezos has written the playbook on one of the options you have: &lt;strong&gt;Go on the offensive&lt;/strong&gt;
and relentlessly hound the tabloids that are trying to take you down using your media
connections. This recounting of what he did and how he succeeded is bizarre, unexpected and reads
like a crime-thriller novel. There are a lot of names and keeping track of all the characters
gets to be a chore though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Big Things You Need to Understand About Inflation (Smith)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-11/debt-makes-the-fed-s-job-harder-if-inflation-accelerates&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/wqxsJ&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), May 11, 2021&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Inflationary pressures are &lt;a href=&quot;https://mospi.gov.in/documents/213904/416359//CPI%20Press%20Release%20April20211620820847886.pdf/86ae651c-6756-3fab-b8b4-c30c60c22f30&quot;&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Central bankers are convinced that this is a
temporary spike and that it will subside. There is a lot of economics jargon thrown around on
publications that are focused towards savvy readers and I don’t understand any of that; so
articles like this one clarify the situation for me, without &lt;em&gt;dumbing&lt;/em&gt; down the issue enough to
make it boring or “obvious”. Laypeople are often disconnected from economic news and seem not to
care much about inflation unless it reaches a record-breaking number and newspapers start running
front-page articles about it (like during India’s double digit inflation period in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://tradingeconomics.com/india/inflation-cpi&quot;&gt;2013-2014&lt;/a&gt;). But inflation plays an important role in daily life (should I buy 10 kg of rice
before the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee releases the minutes of their meeting this Friday?)
and for longer-term investment planning (If &lt;a href=&quot;https://mospi.gov.in/&quot;&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt; is at 5.5% and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbi.co.in/web/interest-rates/interest-rates/deposit-rates&quot;&gt;deposit interest rate&lt;/a&gt; is
4.4%, what term length should I choose for my fixed deposit?).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <id>/2021/05/13/orientation-program-iit-kharagpur-part-4</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“The night is dark and full of terrors” - Parents use phrases like these to put children to sleep
and to curb their adorable natures and their inexhaustible reserves of energy, which enable them to
run around, squealing in delight, until all hours of the night. On exiting childhood, most people
discover the deception that their parents had engaged in. The second years living in the Nehru Hall
at IIT Kharagpur had a remarkable experience: For them, the terrors returned and their parents were
proved right. They were woken up at odd hours of the night, requested to demonstrate the skills they
had learned in the &lt;a href=&quot;/iit-kgp/india/orientation-program/2021/05/11/orientation-program-iit-kharagpur-part-2/&quot;&gt;common room&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;/iit-kgp/india/orientation-program/2021/05/12/orientation-program-iit-kharagpur-part-3/&quot;&gt;dining hall&lt;/a&gt; and subject to a series of deranged
meditations. These polite requests were unlike those that some might be accustomed to, as they were
made by third-, fourth- and fifth-years who stood in the first-floor corridor and directed their
voices downwards towards throngs of second-years who stood in neat rows on the playground. &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt;
was the final form that hazing at IIT Kharagpur, affectionately referred to by the euphemism,
“Orientation Program”, or simply, O.P, assumed. I recount my experience of O.P. in this 4-part
series. This is the fourth and final part, The Midnight Assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a few days in September and October each year, a group of third years would go to the top floor
of Nehru Hall at midnight and begin waking up all the second-years who lived there. An onlooker
might ridicule these amateur explorers; why! Some might even go so far as to call them
malevolent. Allow me to dispel that notion: They were not malevolent; in fact, their intentions were
pure. They aimed to better the lives of the second years who had had the good fortune of being
assigned to this particular hostel through &lt;em&gt;education&lt;/em&gt;, education that the institution can’t (or
won’t) provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A part of the inscription on the Statue of Liberty says that tired, poor and huddled masses yearn to
breathe free. What about the masses who are already free?  How can one awaken this yearning within
them? These third-years had the answer: turn the free masses into tired, sleep-deprived and
resentful masses, so that they might rediscover their freedom. Philosophers have oft-repeated that
losing what you believe you are entitled to is the only way to understand it’s true value. Today, I
go to sleep knowing that not a single deranged person out there can awaken me to serve a strange
power trip. That expectation, which is taken for granted by most, was a luxury when I was in
college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a night like this one, an unbiased observer would witness several third-year students walking
with impunity through a floor full of sleeping second-years. The observer would see them banging
loudly on doors and peering shamelessly through cracks in windows. The observer would notice them
relishing their power and reveling in the authority that had been bestowed upon them by
Nature&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They would be seen employing &lt;em&gt;such innocuous&lt;/em&gt; strategies as entering uninvited into a
room whose door had been left ajar, turning on the bright light or tapping sleepers on their
shoulder in a not-totally-pleasant manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the third-years performed their part in this exercise, they did not bother to hide their
activities or “keep it down”. They feared no retribution. Unlike other hostels in India, the warden
and the hall managers did not actually sleep in the hostel. They were probably asleep in their
homes, dreaming about spending as little time as possible inside the hostel and ensuring that all of
it was during the work-day&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The only remaining adults in the hostel at midnight were the
security guards, tasked with keeping bad people out of the hostel. They did not have any
responsibility for the activities of the people who were already in the hostel though, no matter how
morally corrupt they were or could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hostel’s security guards were curious adults nevertheless. As soon as they realized that what
happened every year was happening this year as well, they would scurry around and make themselves
scarce. This was due to a welling up of &lt;em&gt;noble self-interest&lt;/em&gt;. “Do not meddle in that whose
conclusion is unknown to you” were the words they repeated in prayer each night. No one knew how the
night was going to turn out or where the activities might lead this year. So, it would be most
unfortunate if one were not to have access to the vital weapon in the coward’s arsenal: &lt;strong&gt;Plausible
deniability&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strain of arbitrariness runs through this narrative: Why wake people up at midnight? Why not
before? Why wake them up at all? What could be gotten from this deprivation of one’s own sleep and
that of strangers who clearly wished to remain uneducated? The first 2 questions can be answered
satisfactorily. While throughout the day, second-years went in and out of the hostel as they
pleased, everyone returned to their rooms at night. Being used to sleeping in their own bed
undisturbed, after a day full of activity, the second-years had underestimated the diligence of
their preachers and tormentors, who would gladly give up a night of sleep, if it meant that they
could get drunk on power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After waking the second-years up, they would be lead down to the playground and asked to stand in
neat rows. Once this part was complete, the third-years went about summoning the bishops who would
deliver the day’s sermon. These consisted of some fourth- and fifth-years. The people who held the
titles of “Hall President (HP)” and “Hall Vice President (VP)” were invariably present and jointly
played the role of the Master of Ceremonies. These titles were lofty and meaningless to the real
world, as the letters of the alphabet are meaningless to an infant. Nevertheless, the play-acting
continued. An infant immensely enjoys playing with a building block in the shape of the letter A and
fully grasps the meaning and purpose of that building block: gratification of her desire to &lt;strong&gt;have a
good time&lt;/strong&gt;. And so the person who called himself the “Hall President” believed that there was
meaning in the title as it served his purpose: the realization of their fantasy of wielding
&lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; over people who would never voice their opinion and inconvenience him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first things that the bishops noticed were the minor misalignments in the assembly: someone who
was not neatly lined up, someone else who was sleepy. They took pains to point the person out and
put them in their place by extolling on the virtues of discipline. In this regard, they behaved like
a drill sergeant who had said something incredibly stupid and was being teased by his
subordinates. Feeling anger rise up in his throat, the drill sergeant is harsh with his subordinates
for the next few days. It’s not a proportional revenge; it is the only thing he &lt;strong&gt;knows&lt;/strong&gt; how to
do. If the thought that he should &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; and not make a fool of himself in the future had entered his
mind at all, he did not give it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the assembly was perfect and everyone was in line, the bishops began their sermon. I am
certain the reader will excuse me for not remembering the content due to the exceedingly drowsy
state I found myself in during these occasions. As these were fifth-year students who had the time
and &lt;em&gt;willingness&lt;/em&gt; to preach from a first-floor balcony at 1 a.m., one can safely assume that the
content was primarily non-academic. My faint memory does contain a few choice nuggets of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv1RJTHf5fk&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, akin to the crude teachings of 20-minute TEDx talks. Admittedly, they will be of no
value to competent adults who managed to stumble into a workplace with respectful coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember one astonishing detail clearly. A few of the sermons were blessed by the presence of &lt;strong&gt;an
alumnus&lt;/strong&gt; who used to live in this hostel: An adult who had returned from the real-world and was now
standing at a balcony at 1 a.m., discoursing at 100s of second-years whom he felt an inexplicable
connection with, despite being a complete stranger to them. “It doesn’t make any sense!”, some of
you might be exclaiming. Well, I can only say that your passion for your living quarters did not
match that of those who had returned back to IIT Kharagpur and were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlBtQZnm_68&quot;&gt;reliving their glorious college
days&lt;/a&gt;, possibly wresting back the power they &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; held once-upon-a-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sermon regularly lasted anywhere between an hour and 3 hours. It did eventually end, but the
party was not over yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this late-night / early-morning sermon, one of the rituals was a “Tempo Shout”. It involved
the assembled sleep-deprived second-years getting together in a circle, getting ready to sing
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbaya&quot;&gt;kumbaya&lt;/a&gt; and shouting things. With hoarse voices, a lot of resentment, little energy, and even less
respect for the seniors gazing upon them wistfully from the first floor, these students shouted the
things that they were told to shout. Even those participants who were determined to deal with
everything that was happening as a mere joke, which they alone were in on, gave up and participated
wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another post-sermon activity can be explained only through psychology, due to its puzzling nature
and the warm reception it received among members of the congregation. After the sermon, the
tormentors and the tormented walked to a dilapidated food stall at the entrance of the college
&lt;em&gt;arm-in-arm&lt;/em&gt;. This stall served food rich in carbohydrates (namely, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggi_noodles&quot;&gt;Maggi&lt;/a&gt;). Seniors showed their
magnanimity by buying these plates of food for the second years who had been up all night and could
look forward to a wretched, sleep-deprived, confusing day, which was made better only by the
knowledge that they had learned &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; life lessons which remained hidden from their
well-rested friends who lived in other hostels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this, the priming process that began in the &lt;a href=&quot;/iit-kgp/india/orientation-program/2021/05/11/orientation-program-iit-kharagpur-part-2/&quot;&gt;common room&lt;/a&gt; several weeks ago was finally
complete. In 2014, O.P. at Nehru Hall was a resounding success.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Victorian-era Dining Hall Etiquette</title>
   <link href="/2021/05/12/orientation-program-iit-kharagpur-part-3"/>
   <updated>2021-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/05/12/orientation-program-iit-kharagpur-part-3</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Food holds a special importance in everyday life. A lot of memories are connected to it and
apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/UH8oH#selection-859.33-859.86&quot;&gt;the most important word&lt;/a&gt; in French is the word for the afternoon snack.  In IIT
Kharagpur’s Nehru Hall, there were no such pretensions about food; but a strange reverence was shown
to the place where food was often eaten, the mess hall. The single most important phrase in this
hallowed ground was “Excuse Me”, the over-used English phrase most often heard in Victorian dramas
when heroines flustered by their love interest utter these words and an escape hatch is opened to
them. Second-years were implored: when you are done eating your food and are stepping away from the
table, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; cast this magical incantation. Once cast, the spell worked wonders as it
suppressed the bout of shouting and mocking from third-, fourth- and fifth-years. Curiously,
everyone in the third-year and above inside the same dining hall was exempt from this &lt;em&gt;rule&lt;/em&gt;. As in
Pride and Prejudice, another Victorian-era drama, the female characters who are being married off
have little say in whom they are married to, while the men have all the choice that they could
possibly want; so in Nehru Hall, second years had to follow a lot of rules designed to keep them
“humble and respectful”, while everyone else lead rule-free lives. &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; dichotomy was a part of
hazing at IIT Kharagpur, affectionately referred to by the euphemism, “Orientation Program”, or
simply, O.P. I recount my experience of O.P. in this 4-part series. This is the third part,
Victorian-era Dining Hall Etiquette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closely following the sermon on &lt;a href=&quot;/iit-kgp/india/orientation-program/2021/05/11/orientation-program-iit-kharagpur-part-2/&quot;&gt;self-introduction&lt;/a&gt;, everyone in the hostel appeared to be dead-set on
driving arguably outdated customs and practices into the brains of second years. As their location,
they chose the one place that second-years were bound to visit a few times each day: the dining hall
(or mess hall or just, “mess”). The food that was served here was edible; I hesitate to add any
other epithet. While eating this food required a profound acceptance of the status quo, the
experience of second-year students in particular was improved by third-, fourth- and fifth-years
engaging the hungry masses in spirited conversations about rules, the importance of rules, and
adhering to rules. They also provided comic relief, by making jokes at the second-years’
expense. Laughing at a joke someone else makes at your expense is the age-old path to stress-relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topics of discussion ranged from the slightly uncomfortable&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to the deeply
distressing&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And like the proverbial lunch lady in kindergarten, the tormentors pointed out
the slightest violation in etiquette among the victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you leave the table without excusing yourself? This would earn you an inexplicably long lecture
about values, respect for elders and propriety. The lecture did run the risk of provoking a victim
into an impassioned speech about the propriety of tormenting ostensible strangers at the dinner
table. The victim might ask the third-years “What gives you &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/gk9C1ukV-EM?t=19&quot;&gt;the right&lt;/a&gt;?” I did not witness any such
altercation though, and it was probably because &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; second years held these people in &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt;
regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you step away from the table to get food at the buffet but did not put your chair in a position
indicating that it was occupied? This minor transgression of a deranged directive would be the
trigger for an unsolicited meditation on the meaning of “rules” and the importance of following them
when you are in your second year and disregarding them when you are in your third year&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
Apparently, rules should be followed at least for a year, so that one gets a &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt; for what
rule-following &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like. After that, the former rule-followers are promoted to be “enforcers”. I
live by this even today and never follow any rule for more than a year; it has served me well in the
real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you have the &lt;em&gt;audacity&lt;/em&gt; to walk into the mess-hall in attire that exposed your bare knees?
Well, this was the cardinal sin and would provoke a collective gasp in the form of a loud,
screeching, and wholly unpleasant noise emanating from the exalted fourth-years. You would be gently
reminded that the rules prohibited this &lt;strong&gt;kind of attire&lt;/strong&gt;. Some second-years might be dispatched to
the back of the dining hall, to read the list of rules and give the fourth years a summary of what
was written there. Others might face the less loaded question, “Can you even read English?”. To this
question, I present the answer that I prepared but never had a chance to deliver: “Yes, I can read
English. Also, I am particularly glad that I can write English; for I intend to return to my room
and write down what just transpired in a note for reference in the &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These conversations might appear normal or even friendly. Some might counsel the victim, “This kind
of rhetorical questioning is how barbarians have broken ice for centuries. Cheer up!”. Yet others
might console, “This was nothing compared to what happened in the dining halls in my college hostel
…”. These people are &lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt;! I find the latter piece of nostalgic recounting particularly
soothing. The world is famously resistant to change. What happened to your parents in college &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt;
happen to you in college. It will also happen to your offspring. Why else would the most memorable
phrase about &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; be &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;em&gt;the lack of&lt;/em&gt; change is the only constant”&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some second-years managed to avoid the tables where these vultures scavenged for their almost-dead
prey. Others employed devious methods and avoided these conversations altogether during the
prolonged period of a month. These conversations in the mess could jump out of the dark and assault
anyone, those who were complacent and had dropped their guard were particularly
susceptible. Everyone knew that this was going on in the dining hall as they heard stories from
second-year students who praised their seniors in curiously crude language. The anxiety felt by the
&lt;em&gt;about-to-be-hazed&lt;/em&gt; is identical in scale to the exhilaration felt by the &lt;em&gt;already-hazed&lt;/em&gt;. At least
the &lt;em&gt;already-hazed&lt;/em&gt; can rest easy knowing that they have gained access to &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; that is
refused to people who have the misfortune of living in civil society!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the diligent conductors of O.P., one second-year student left uneducated equaled defeat; “No man
left uneducated”, was their creed. So, they took the fight to educate to the room in which these
second-years slept after a long day. In the final installment of this 4-part series, I will relate
the curious nights during which second-years stood in neat rows on the ground in the middle of the
night, while fifth-years and even some alumni discoursed at them from the first-floor balcony.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Sermon in the Common Room</title>
   <link href="/2021/05/11/orientation-program-iit-kharagpur-part-2"/>
   <updated>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/05/11/orientation-program-iit-kharagpur-part-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a second year student at IIT Kharagpur, the 2.5 months between July and September 2014 were
uneventful at Nehru Hall, one of several hostels inside the campus. Then, things took a turn. While
I believe that it was for the better, the voice at the back of my head believes it was for the
worse. In this post, I relate the story of a sermon that was delivered in the common room of my
hostel. The sermon in question was about the art of introducing oneself to a group of
strangers. While many might naively believe that they have mastered this art, this sermon will open
your eyes (as it did mine) to the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; manner of making a first impression. &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; was an
integral part of hazing at IIT Kharagpur, affectionately referred to by the euphemism, “Orientation
Program”, or simply, O.P. I recount my experience in this 4-part series. This is the second part,
The Sermon in the Common Room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the sermon, comes the priming. The preacher must establish his preeminence, ease the
congregation into the environment where the sermon will be given and familiarize the congregation
with the tone that will be used. In 1973 in an undisclosed location, a process similar to this
priming is said to have taken 6 days. In that case, the pressure was higher and the stakes hardly
comparable, and the results left experts baffled at this technique’s effectiveness in endearing the
preacher to the congregation. In Kharagpur in 2014, it took about 10 days and achieved &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt;
results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day, all the second-year students were &lt;em&gt;courteously invited&lt;/em&gt; to the hostel’s common
room, at 9 pm right after dinner. To the uninitiated, this sounded like a friendly invitation to get
to know the seniors who were living in the same hostel: everyone studying in 3rd year and above. The
assembly was moderately successful and about 100 people sat on the floor in a well-ventilated
room. A group of about 15 third-year students introduced themselves in-turn. These students were
central to the organization and smooth execution of O.P. Nothing in their introductions stood out
and I shudder to even imagine my inattentiveness during this part. After the introductions, there
were some “general” announcements and calls for auditions for various hostel teams: athletics, team
sports, dumb charades and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These calls to auditions were courteous: “If you can swim and want to be a part of the hostel’s
swimming team, then talk to the captain of that team”. Then, the captain would take the stage and
make a pitch to get people to come to the auditions or try-outs for their team. All the captains
succeeded at making participation in hall activities sound like noble pursuits. These teams would
compete in a yearly extravaganza known as the General Championships (or G.Cs) in which hostels
competed against each other in a variety of competitions; points were awarded to the victor and the
championship was awarded to the hostel with the most points. Every hostel had won this championship
at some point in the past. Nehru Hall was no exception. But the captains were skilled pitchmen and
made winning the GC sound like an exceptional achievement that no one else was capable or worthy
of. They stressed that no other mere “hostel” could win the GC, because of the sheer desire that
thrived &lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt; at Nehru “hall”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rational member of the congregation might be expected to ask, “Well, how come you didn’t win the
GC last year? Or the year before that? Or once in the past 5 years?”. I have never seen anyone
asking questions at a sermon though, so I believe such a question would have been highly
inappropriate. If asked, the question would have provoked a lively discussion about the &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt;
that the GC was not won by &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; “hall”: &lt;strong&gt;Collusion between the external judges of an event and the
people living in other hostels&lt;/strong&gt;. These theories covered a lot of ground and the preachers did not
balk at hurling allegations far-and-wide: “The judge was another hostel’s hall president’s nephew’s
mother’s colleague’s son’s Guitar teacher! That was clearly the reason for the blatant bias shown by
the judge during the event last year”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These theories also included the Secretaries of each event, student representatives who were tasked
with conducting the events and whose job it was to find judges for each event. These Secretaries
were elected through an election where students voted and they were often from other hostels. The
mere fact that the people who were choosing the judges were from a “hostel” was proof for many that
there was a massive conspiracy against our “hall”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On listening to this answer, the rational member who had asked the question would fall silent and
introspect quietly at the lack of wisdom which had caused them to begin this discussion. Everyone
else thought about the theories just put out and continued to listen with rapt attention to the
preachers, who were talking about fantastical things that had happened in the past which had lead to
the crushing defeat of &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; hall in the G.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of spectators during these post-dinner “group hangs” in the common room remained steady
with mostly repeat participants. I was fascinated by the determined group of preachers who had taken
it upon themselves to educate the second-year students. What other proof could I provide of their
magnanimity to you, dear reader? This priming period worked phenomenally well as the third-years
conducting these sessions quickly rose to prominence in second-year circles and were revered as
people whom one could look up to for advice in a tough situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 11th day, things changed dramatically. While there was no outward change in the structure of
the session, there was more shouting; much, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more shouting. The topic of this session and
several sessions after this day was deceptively simple: Introducing oneself to a group of
strangers. The techniques would also be effective if one were trying to pacify an angry mob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third years who were 19 years &lt;del&gt;old&lt;/del&gt; young deigned to teach 18 year old second-years how to introduce
themselves &lt;em&gt;properly&lt;/em&gt; to a group of strangers. The script was simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My name is [INSERT NAME HERE].&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I am a 2nd year student at the Department of [DEPARTMENT] at IIT Kharagpur.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I live in Nehru Hall and my hobbies are [HOBBY 1, HOBBY 2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reader might well want to point out that this script makes a lot of sense and conveys
information about the speaker to the audience concisely. I wholeheartedly agree with the
reader. Although, it would be wise on the reader’s part to reserve judgment on this whole exercise
until &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; I have related the instructions that came with this script regarding how it should be
delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preachers preached, the &lt;em&gt;tenet of utmost importance&lt;/em&gt; when introducing oneself was to be
&lt;em&gt;confident&lt;/em&gt;. Confidence being one of the non-verbal parts of communication, one must take extra
pains to verbalize it. To this end, the preachers implored each second-year in the audience: When
introducing yourself, &lt;strong&gt;SHOUT AT THE TOP OF YOUR VOICE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After listening to a demonstration, I would offer an alternative characterization which will be
easier to imagine if you are an avid horror movie watcher: &lt;strong&gt;SCREAM LIKE THE CHARACTER WHO HAS JUST
SEEN A GHOST&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this tenet was revealed, the time was ripe for some &lt;em&gt;hands-on learning&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;blameless&lt;/strong&gt; exercises
where a second-year student was asked to stand-up and deliver their self-introduction. If the
student stumbled on any part of their introduction, the preachers asked him to start again, by
shouting &lt;strong&gt;loudly&lt;/strong&gt; at him. The preachers shouting makes complete sense as they were only being
confident and not chastising the student in any way at all, in fact they were being very supportive,
evidenced by both their mocking and their constant interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preachers had noticed what I have long noticed about confident people. When confident people
talk, it is clear to the listener that (a) they have rehearsed what they are saying a few hundred
times, (b) they &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; pause to collect their thoughts, and (c) they do not change their response
depending on the audience. The well-rehearsed delivery with no hiccups makes the speech sound
natural, unlike the pre-recorded mechanical voice without any emotion that one hears when
computerized assistants like Alexa or Siri introduce themselves. The lack of any breaks in the
speech indicates that the speaker does not need to burden their brain with thinking or
introspection. And the constancy in content irrespective of the audience is the pinnacle of the
egalitarian principle&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the preachers preached, when introducing yourself, &lt;strong&gt;look &lt;em&gt;every person&lt;/em&gt; in the audience
straight in the eye&lt;/strong&gt;. The naive student of human anatomy would quickly retort that this is
impossible; that to achieve it one would have to unnaturally oscillate their head, tracing a
semicircle with the tip of their nose. They would also add that moving your head around like an
automaton would make the listeners uncomfortable due to the uncharacteristic juxtaposition of the
confident, not-at-all automaton-like voice shouting at them and the robotic movements. The preachers
contended that this was a natural motion. The aim of the tactic was straightforward: one should make
everyone feel &lt;strong&gt;included&lt;/strong&gt;. After the shouting that had ensued just minutes prior, no one in the
audience wanted to draw the ire of the preachers by voicing their opinion. The congregation had
fallen in line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the street magician aims to swindle onlookers out of their money by showing them a sleight of
hand and convincing them of their certain victory when the dice is cast, a confident
self-introduction can sweep the audience off their feet through these 2 rudimentary tactics. Thus,
the preachers ended their sermon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tactics are controversial: many people in the world outside IIT Kharagpur&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; believe that
they are absurd, counter-productive and would make one a laughing stock if adhered to!
Astonishingly, even the voice in the back of my head agrees wholeheartedly with those people. How
can such utterly opposite natures reside within my own person?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sessions continued unabated for 6 days with more-or-less the same content. The sermon ended at
11 pm and all the second-years were tired from having to sit on the ground for more than 2 hours. On
returning to their rooms, they promptly fell asleep, mentally counting their blessings at having the
guidance of world-wise men who were willing to spend mind boggling amounts of time schooling them on
&lt;strong&gt;basic&lt;/strong&gt; soft-skills, such as shouting at the top of your voice, choosing hobbies that were
beneficial to your hostel and why other halls did not have &lt;em&gt;that undefinable quality&lt;/em&gt; required to
win the GC&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The drowsy second-years would remember that this valuable tutelage was not being offered
to their peers in &lt;em&gt;grossly inferior&lt;/em&gt; “hostels” such as LBS, where the seniors were shirking their
duty of conducting O.P and had the &lt;strong&gt;audacity&lt;/strong&gt; to focus on their personal lives. These seniors were
indifferent and did not want to play a major part in valuable and meaningful endeavors such as
raising the esteem of their living quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this sermon was delivered to a congregation where participation was voluntary, more was about
to come, and future sermons would &lt;strong&gt;go&lt;/strong&gt; where the second-year was. The Common Room was seldom
frequented by some parishioners and these people were missing out on &lt;em&gt;essential knowledge&lt;/em&gt;. To
remedy this, the next part of O.P. was conducted in a place which no one could avoid: The Dining
Hall.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Curious Case of the Dweller Who Wouldn't Move Out</title>
   <link href="/2021/05/10/orientation-program-iit-kharagpur-part-1"/>
   <updated>2021-05-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/05/10/orientation-program-iit-kharagpur-part-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the end of my first year at IIT Kharagpur, an engineering college in India, I packed up
everything I owned into cardboard boxes, put them in the common room of my hostel and went back to
my parent’s home for the summer vacation. 2 months later, in the second week of July 2014, I
returned to my new hostel, Nehru Hall. I found that my room had not been vacated yet and was not
ready for “check-in”. &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; was the beginning of hazing at IIT Kharagpur, affectionately referred
to by the euphemism, “Orientation Program” or simply, O.P. I recount my experience of O.P in this
4-part series. This is the first part, The Curious Case of the Dweller Who Wouldn’t Move Out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur from 2013-2018. I lived in MMM hall during my
first year, from June 2013 to April 2014. Then, I shifted to another hostel, Nehru Hall, in
July 2014. I lived there until my graduation in May 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At IIT Kharagpur, hazing happens at the beginning of the second year, from August to November. Most
colleges haze first-year students right after they arrive on campus. Clearly, at some point in the
venerated history of the 60 year old institution that I studied at, some wise soul realized that
tormenting 17 year old freshmen, who were living away from their parents for the first time, was
cruel and set out to rectify the arrangement. The wise soul’s motives were pure, and knowing that
there were good people on both sides, he decreed that hazing should be &lt;em&gt;postponed&lt;/em&gt; from 1st year to
2nd year. We &lt;strong&gt;owe a great debt&lt;/strong&gt; to him, for his decree improved the lot of at least a few
people. Namely, the exceedingly small percentage of people who drop-out of college after their
freshman year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2014, I learned about the hostel that I would be living at for the forthcoming 4 years
through an Excel sheet. Arriving back on campus a month later, I proceeded to my new accommodations
on the third floor of Nehru Hall. I saw a set of government buildings, inexplicably dark and
ominous. Walking through the ground floor corridor, I looked for labels that would lead me to my
room, I found none. I would later learn that labeling was frowned upon; A true “Nehruite”, as the
dwellers took to calling themselves, would &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; where his room was, he would not have to be guided
in any way, shape or form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to share my room with 2 other second-year students, both of whom I had never met
before. While walking up and down several flights of stairs in this unmarked building, I felt like
the proverbial driver wandering around in a cavernous underground parking lot having forgotten where
they had parked their car. Eventually, I arrived at my future room. The door was locked and no one
could be found nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hostel had functionaries, government officials tasked with running the mundane day-to-day
operations. Presuming that their responsibilities included assisting new occupants, I asked them
what the appropriate path forward was, specifically, where I was supposed to spend the
night. Instead of getting an answer, I witnessed something remarkable. The functionaries vanished
into thin air, leaving behind a flurry of smoke in the shape of “We have to ask the warden. Come
back tomorrow morning at 10 am”. I was left to my own devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of these functionaries is a sight for sore eyes, like the oasis seen in the desert by a
famished traveler on a hot summer’s day. Like the oasis, the closer one gets to them, the clearer
one’s understanding of their (lack of) actual powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing the prospect of a night without a roof over my head, I frantically called my friends to find
out what their plans were. Several of them had not yet returned. Those that had returned had found
lodging with other friends. I even called up a nearby hotel, the only one in the surrounding few
kilometers. Smartphones might be widespread in the urban world of 2021. But people were still amazed
at the sound of a ringing telephone and scurried away from the sound back in 2014. Callers who had
the good fortune of having their phone call answered by this hotel’s &lt;em&gt;receptionist&lt;/em&gt; counted their
blessings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venturing further out in my network of connections, I called up a Ph.D. student I knew. He had not
had to change his lodgings during the summer and he was willing to take me in for the night. To him,
I am eternally grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lonely and dejected “Nehruite”, after being left without a room by his new hostel, had found a
place to sleep. He nevertheless felt proud of the amazing feats that his hostel had achieved in
years past. He had learned about them from the noticeboards in his new hostel which prominently
displayed them. Untroubled by the fact that he had absolutely nothing to do with these past feats,
he claimed full credit for them. He saw the bright future he had in his new “hall”, which was
incomparably superior to the mere “hostels” that were scattered all around campus. He scoffed at the
voice in the back of his head that told him that all the hostels were identical and had no
significance outside of being living quarters. This voice tried in vain to convince the Nehruite
that he is &lt;em&gt;connected&lt;/em&gt; to his hostel’s past as much as a traveler is connected to the past of a
hotel where they have never spent a night. The Nehruite disregarded the nagging voice with ease and
&lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt; meaning that was revealed only to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week went by. Every day during lunch time, I went to my room to see if the previous occupants had
made an appearance. As I understood it, they were taking their sweet time to return to campus. I was
mildly annoyed at their lack of foresight and at the indifference they had shown towards the plight
of the future dwellers of their room. But I waited patiently for them to show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the second-years who were supposed to move to this hostel were in the same situation and were
living with their friends in uncomfortably small quarters. But they found consolation in their
dreams. Every night, they dreamed about the heights their new hostel would take them to. Especially
during Diwali, the Indian festival of lights and a time of general merry-making, when they would be
standing on cots &lt;em&gt;borrowed&lt;/em&gt; from their peers. These peers had happily given up this material
pleasure and were sleeping on the ground during the cold winter month of November &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt;
any resentment towards the borrower clouding their heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voice dwelling in the back of my head reared its head once more and posed a &lt;em&gt;reasonable
question&lt;/em&gt; this time. “Why had the functionaries not foreseen the eventuality of the stranded
second-year student and the third-year student who refuses to move out?”, it inquired. It did not
give in to my diligent attempt at driving it away. Indeed, the voice was energized by the fact that
MMM Hall, my old hostel, had foreseen this possibility and asked me to move out of my room &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;
leaving the campus. The voice proffered, “Perhaps your new hostel is run by people who don’t care
about second-years”. I was astonished at this suggestion and quickly dismissed it as absurd and
baseless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was further troubled by the voice because it had thought &lt;strong&gt;reasonably&lt;/strong&gt;. This kind of rational
thinking was a most undesirable quality when dealing with the things that happened inside Nehru
Hall. I reminded myself that asking questions had repercussions. Questions have long been known to
be a thorn in the side of bad planning and intentional indifference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 days had gone by. At 5 pm on the eleventh day, I made my daily pilgrimage to my future room and
was elated to see that the room was unlocked and that one of the occupants had shown up. Seeing as
he was a year older than me and world-wise beyond my imagination, I felt no need to explain my
predicament to him. Alas, on this count, I had grossly miscalculated. Much as a horse standing in
front of a river indignantly demands to be lead up to water, so did the previous occupant demand to
know why I had shown the impunity to show up unannounced. This Curious Character advised me to be
humble, to wait patiently, to allow the elders to do as they saw fit and not to question their
wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding no purchase for arguments laden with reason or emotion with the Curious Character, I went
back to my previous approach of waiting patiently for him to move out. I later found out that this
occupant was one of the well-known delinquents in the hostel and it was not surprising that he had
engaged in this strange power play by prolonging his residence in a room that wasn’t his. “Knock and
the door will be opened to you”, says the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblehub.com/matthew/7-7.htm&quot;&gt;good book&lt;/a&gt;. I was disheartened to find out that there is no
verse about occupants not shifting out of their old accommodations when the period of their stay
ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 days after I met him, the Curious Character finally moved out. I moved in swiftly and spent the
remaining few days in July and the whole of August getting used to my new situation: new living
quarters, new roommates and new neighbors. Nothing untoward appeared to be on the horizon and life
proceeded with much abandon. Things were about to take a turn, but I was unaware of the precise
nature of the upcoming twist in the road.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Critique of Context-Free Journalism</title>

   <updated>2021-05-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/05/08/journalism-without-context</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Journalism is the act of taking facts and expert opinions, putting them together with the context
required to make them meaningful, and producing a piece that consumers will learn &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;
from&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is the basic framework I use to understand and evaluate news
organizations. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.Newslaundry.com/&quot;&gt;Newslaundry&lt;/a&gt; is an Indian subscription-based independent news organization that I
started following with the hope that their “indie music” approach to journalism was the refreshing
breeze that Indian news media desperately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK7y3OsKQzY&quot;&gt;needs&lt;/a&gt;. My findings were disappointing, a recent episode of
their daily news briefing podcast had a story which was read out with none of the required
context. This symbolizes the problems media organizations face and have left unresolved. I will
continue to read the work that Newslaundry produces, albeit with lowered expectations when compared
to what I have for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/&quot;&gt;NHK&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the three major stages in the reporting of news:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovering information:&lt;/strong&gt; Something happens: a report is released, an expert says something in
an interview, a research paper predicts that the world as we know it will no longer exist in 2012
etc. &lt;a href=&quot;https://assignmenteditor.com/news-wires/&quot;&gt;Wire services&lt;/a&gt; like the Associated Press have existed since the widespread use of the
telegram in the late 1800s and their goal is to produce the “official” version of events, which
will be used as a jumping off point by news organizations such as the New York Times or local
papers that rely on them for national or international news&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gathering context:&lt;/strong&gt; “Understanding what happened yesterday, requires you to understand what
happened a week, a month or several years ago” (Matthew Yglesias, one of the founders of
Vox). This is the crucial step in reporting the news and the best organizations do this
well. They take different approaches to this problem: Bloomberg employs a bevy of columnists with
expertise in various niche topics who publish informed, well-researched, opinion pieces. New York
Times takes a neutral approach which relies on a reporting network that spans the whole world and
employs people from every country. These reporters have a native understanding of the events that
they are covering. Vox does this through meticulous research on wonky topics which are mostly
centered on America but occasionally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yzMUs3badc&quot;&gt;global&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone agrees that this part is important but a
lot of news organizations simply ignore this step, resulting in pieces that readers scroll past.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing an article:&lt;/strong&gt; The final step in the process is deceptively simple. It involves an
ill-defined mix of the skills of a writer and the skills of an editor to produce an article that
is self-sufficient and is long enough to convey the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; amount of information. The final
product is not always an article: It can be a video (a script + visuals) or a podcast (a script +
answers from an expert or opinions from the host). Some organizations excel at this step:
Magazines are particularly good at this because they have the ability to spend the kind of time
that would appear unreasonable to news organization focusing on the “outrage of the
day”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Bloomberg Businessweek’s feature-length &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-09/this-is-how-tim-cook-transformed-apple-aapl-after-steve-jobs&quot;&gt;article about Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt;, New Yorker’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/shape-things-come&quot;&gt;profile
of Apple designer Jony Ive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Guardian’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/apr/27/the-clockwork-universe-is-free-will-an-illusion&quot;&gt;Long Read about freewill&lt;/a&gt; are brilliant examples
of well-reported, beautifully written pieces that cover an open question and give the reader the
space to ruminate about what is written long after they initially read the article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-newslaundry&quot;&gt;What is Newslaundry?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.Newslaundry.com/&quot;&gt;Newslaundry&lt;/a&gt; started with the goal of being independent and subscriber funded and they have stuck to
this model. There have been a large number of reported pieces in which their reporters have talked
to people on the ground and broadcast these conversations as video features or as articles on their
website. Newslaundry also has a really good Hindi section with articles that cover a whole variety
of topics and I appreciate that they are doing this despite the limited audience for online Hindi
news&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started listening to Newslaundry’s daily news briefing podcast “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.Newslaundry.com/podcast/daily-dose&quot;&gt;Daily Dose&lt;/a&gt;” around 6 months ago. A
new episode is released every day of the week. Each episode is about 8-15 minutes long and contains
the top news stories from India and the world. The episodes also inevitably contain one message
placed somewhere in the middle which urges the listener to subscribe to their service (the podcast
is free and can be streamed on &lt;em&gt;your favorite podcast app&lt;/em&gt;). Most of the episodes also contain
references to a reported piece or a ground report on the website and I tried to read as many as I
could manage to get a sense for both the podcast and the written pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The written pieces are thoroughly researched and well-written. I have found that most of the pieces
don’t have the depth that is required to understand the historical context, but this is a pet peeve
and doesn’t hinder the reader from understanding what is being said or why it is important. No piece
that I read over the past 4 months stood out particularly either for the content or the writing and
I have only one &lt;a href=&quot;https://cutouts.siddharthkannan.in/article/503&quot;&gt;cutout&lt;/a&gt; from the website during that period. The stories that were being covered were
solidly in the current affairs realm. Their value stems from the fact that no other news
organization in India is covering these topics with this steady regularity and journalistic
integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;context-free-journalism&quot;&gt;Context-free journalism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.Newslaundry.com/2021/05/05/daily-dose-ep-715-sc-strikes-down-maratha-quota-covid-updates-oxygen-shortage-in-karnataka&quot;&gt;Episode 715 of the “Daily Dose”&lt;/a&gt;, I found an example of context-free journalism that left me
rather disoriented and cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(01:53) Indigo has transported a total of 4142 Oxygen concetrators, weighing nearly 72,500 kg, across
India. 2717 concentrators were airlifted from Thailand, China, Qatar, Hong Kong and Singapore; while
1425 were transported domestically between 36 airports.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Allahabad High Court …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story about the oxygen concentrators has &lt;strong&gt;no context&lt;/strong&gt;. The story before it was about diagnostic
testing advisories to states and the story after it was about the judiciary criticizing the UP state
government. In particular,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The listener has no idea what to make of this number: 4142 concentrators. How many concentrators
are there in India right now? How many were transported yesterday by other airlines? Why is
Indigo the only airline that’s being pointed out here?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The listener can’t make sense of the other number: 72,500 kg. How big is this? Is it the size of
a single airplane? Is it multiple airplanes? I don’t know what this number is even doing in this
sentence. Ratios and comparisons put big numbers into context.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does the detailed split tell the listener? Nothing. 4142 = 2717 international + 1425
domestic. Sure, that sounds good, but what does it mean? All I understood was that a majority of
the concentrators were imported. But why were they imported? Why aren’t more being manufactured
in India? How many were imported yesterday? Are more going to be imported tomorrow? … so on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this important?&lt;/strong&gt; I know that there is a shortage of oxygen concentrators right now. But
assuming that the listener already knows a part of the news is counter-intuitive for a news
podcast&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The segment left me disoriented and with more questions than I had. And I was cross about it because
I believed that this was an important news story but &lt;strong&gt;I didn’t get the information I wanted&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This segment with more context would probably sound like this: “About N concentrators were
transported yesterday by the 3 major airlines, A, B and C. Of these, X% were imported from Country
D, Country E and Country F among others, while the remaining were manufactured in India, mainly in
the cities of G, H and I. India has been facing a major shortage of concentrators during the ongoing
Covid19 wave of infections. Experts say that Y% more concentrators are required to prevent adverse
outcomes due to the lack of this life-saving device”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this is a cherry-picked example. I had been thinking about writing a critique of
Newslaundry for the past couple weeks and this podcast was simply the trigger to write it today and
not put it off. But this is emblematic of a deeper problem that is either misunderstood or ignored
by the practitioners of this profession, journalism: The listener always needs more context than
experts do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone who has worked in the logistics industry would know that transporting 72,500 kg of cargo in
a single day is a huge achievement, or maybe they know that it’s just a drop in the ocean and not
worth mentioning at all. I don’t work in that industry and I have absolutely no idea what it means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a great recent counter-example of journalism which has just the right amount of context, I would
present &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/podcasts/the-daily/alexei-navalny-russia-protests.html&quot;&gt;the episode about Aleksei Navalny&lt;/a&gt; on The Daily, a New York Times podcast. I have never been
to Russia and I knew little about Russian politics or geography before I heard this episode. After
listening to it, I understood what was going on, why it was important and what Navalny’s role in it
precisely was. The context was vital in my understanding that. I can easily imagine this episode
botching the presentation up by reducing the context just a little bit (such as naming the cities
where there were huge protests but not mentioning their geographical importance, or the historical
rarity of wide-spread protests in Russia) which would have left me confused and tuned-out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;other-critiques&quot;&gt;Other Critiques&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newslaundry also does “media critique” in the form of articles on their websites and a YouTube show
called “Newsance” which points out the problems in the way other news organizations covered news
stories. I have found this part of their reporting &lt;strong&gt;problematic&lt;/strong&gt; because it gave me the feeling that
they were playing both sides of the news business: they are an organization reporting the news &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;
an organization criticizing other news organization who are in that business. Some of their media
critique blends uncomfortably into plugging the way that they covered the news story that is being
talked about. I haven’t seen or read a lot of their media critique articles due to this reason. I
would much rather rely on non-profit groups and think-tanks to play the role of the “media
watchdog”(like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediamatters.org/about-us&quot;&gt;Media Matters for America&lt;/a&gt; in the US) and have news organizations only report the
news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intend to continue to subscribe to Newslaundry and listen to their daily briefings
podcast. However, I will re-calibrate my expectations and expect less context and more current
affairs news, which is valuable in its own right, but is less valuable than a fully-formed product
with the appropriate context. In a media landscape over-run with propaganda machines like Times Now
and Republic TV, Newslaundry is one of the few organizations that publishes a wide-variety of
coverage, a large part of which is critical of the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The “something” is intentionally ill-defined: People are different and they expect different things from the news they consume. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A phrase that is often used by Ezra Klein on “The Ezra Klein Show” when talking about whether journalists should cover “current affairs” or focus on evergreen topics. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/Pwknh&quot;&gt;Archive&lt;/a&gt; retrieved 2020-12-29 &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a hunch. I don’t know that the audience is limited. If I find data out there which says that the audience for online Hindi news is actually larger than the audience for English news, I will update this section. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have left out “What is an Oxygen concentrator?” in this list. I don’t know what they are or how big they are etc; I was not expecting this kind of context from the beginning because my expectations were already lowered. If this was a popular podcast like NYT’s The Daily or a Bloomberg QuickTake, then I would have expected an explanation of what a concentrator, what it looks like and why it saves lives. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <id>/2021/04/30/monthly-recommendations-2021-april</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The recommendations for April 2021 are in! This month, an unsettling article about the disastrous
consequences of the intersection of a dance form and a journey of self-discovery is at the top of
the list. Also, there’s an article about pandemics (everyone’s &lt;em&gt;favorite&lt;/em&gt; topic since Jan 2020) and
a profile of the author of a book that I did not like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;dancer-in-the-dark-aviv&quot;&gt;Dancer in the Dark (Aviv)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/06/the-unravelling-of-a-dancer&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/EqBWX&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), March 30, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of a dancer who wants to perfect herself at the Butoh dance form and her relationship with
her teacher, mentor and performer. The consequences are disastrous; the reader realizes in just a
few paragraphs that the worst is yet to come. For the rest of the journey while reading the article,
one awaits with trepidation for the hammer to fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pandemics-and-the-shape-of-human-history-kolbert&quot;&gt;Pandemics and the Shape of Human History (Kolbert)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/06/pandemics-and-the-shape-of-human-history&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/YT2jD&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), March 30, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The period before and after a pandemic has never been identical: Things will not go back to the way
they were. There will &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; be some sort of “after” period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;new-yorker-profile-of-sapiens-author-harari&quot;&gt;New Yorker profile of Sapiens author Harari&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/17/yuval-noah-harari-gives-the-really-big-picture&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/2fV3m&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;), February 10, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harari’s book Sapiens was bad: It was vacuous and fiction masquerading as non-fiction. This profile
paints an honest picture of a bizarre conversation. Harari’s skill at doing good PR is commendable:
He understood that a lot of people read bestselling books so that they can say that they have read
them. He wrote a book with an abundance of hand-waving and marketed it as non-fiction. One instance
makes it clear that Harari cares little about the content and even less about his readers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In “Homo Deus,” Harari writes that, in 2014, a Hong Kong venture-capital firm “broke new ground by
appointing an algorithm named VITAL to its board.” A footnote provides a link to an online article,
which makes clear that, in fact, there had been no such board appointment, and that the press
release announcing it was a lure for “gullible” outlets. When I asked Harari if he’d accidentally
led readers into believing a fiction, he appeared untroubled, arguing that the book’s larger point
about A.I. encroachment still held.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know if it’s a true story,” Harari told me. “It doesn’t matter–it’s a good story.” He
rethought this. “It matters how you present it to the readers. I think I took care to make sure that
at least intelligent readers will understand that it maybe didn’t happen.” (The story has been
traced to a Johnny Carson monologue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, Harari writes books that are a lot like a tweet: Lot of bold claims, most of
them untrue, some of them made up and all of them certain to outrage the reader into talking about
the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pew-research-center-shrinking-global-middle-class&quot;&gt;Pew Research Center: Shrinking Global middle class&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID19’s economic impact has been vast, this report quantifies the impact on a wide spectrum of
people by considering World Bank growth estimates from January 2020 and January 2021. The difference
between these two estimates is the loss to each income tier. Global middle class population went
from 899mn to 1.34bn from 2011 to 2019, an increase of 54mn people annually; the pandemic erased a
year of growth for the global middle-class. Quantifying the impact gives the reader hope, as we have
identified who needs to be helped out in future economic stimulus packages.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hazing: Motives and countermeasures: An abstract analysis</title>
   <link href="/2021/04/11/hazing-in-colleges"/>
   <updated>2021-04-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/04/11/hazing-in-colleges</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The point of hazing is to make the victims of the hazing want to haze the next class of victims
– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-18/goldman-analysts-work-too-hard&quot;&gt;Levine on analysts at Goldman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking about my experience with bullying during childhood and hazing in college. I
turned out “okay”: I escaped the worst of it by laying low. I laughed at the parts that I
found hilarious. I ridiculed the people who were hazing me. I looked around and found (rather
easily) some of their peers, who also ridiculed them and were incomparably &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;better&lt;/span&gt; than them (in my
estimation). I endured what I could find no way out of. And I enabled the subsequent classes of
victims to escape it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On graduating college and entering a new phase of my life, old bonds where cherished and new
friendships were formed; belonging was felt and people &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;cared&lt;/span&gt;. With the benefit of hindsight, I
consider the question of hazing once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-do-people-engage-in-hazing&quot;&gt;Why do people engage in hazing?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think as I might, I am unable to come up with a single, satisfying justification for it. Here are
some candidates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hazing is a power trip:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as the immigration officer adjudicating the entry of thousands of
tourists asks them questions and forces them to do things that don’t serve any apparent
purpose&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; before stamping their passport, so can the seniors inside a hostel reinforce their
power through hazing. They are big fish in a small pond; a perverse pleasure can be gained from
harassing others. Safe in their beliefs that juniors can do nothing against this harassment, that
institutions don’t have the right controls to curb it and ignorant of the extent of their soft
power, seniors take full advantage of their position&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cycle of abuse:&lt;/strong&gt; “I was hazed, and hence I shall haze”. Even among those who seem to have
experienced the underlying nature of the world, this argument holds considerable purchase. Often,
this argument is framed as “I was hazed and it is only fair for me to try it out and see if it
makes me feel better” or “I was hazed and I think it made me more resilient. Thus, it is my duty
to pass this on”. I can say unequivocally that this argument &lt;strong&gt;betrays&lt;/strong&gt; a damning lack of
identity, morality and first principles, the things that are eternally true irrespective of the
situation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hazing builds community:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an elegant argument from the abuser’s point of
view: They convince themselves that they are bringing the victims together; pushing them closer
by putting them all through the same kind of hardship, playing the part of the proverbial “lunch
lady” whom they will rant about in weeks to come. The formation of a bond that would not have
existed in the absence of this external &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;stimulus&lt;/span&gt; is unnecessary, and the bond thus formed &lt;strong&gt;will
not&lt;/strong&gt; survive long. The community that is supposedly built is merely an illusion that abusers who
don’t have the stomach to face up to what they are doing conjure. Communities are built through
warmth, empathy and companionship in the time of need; &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; through abuse for abuse’s sake.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hazing builds character:&lt;/strong&gt; The abuser engages in artful deception. They wash themselves clean of
responsibility by declaring, “I can credit myself for the &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;characters&lt;/span&gt; that I have built
today”. I have heard seniors boasting about former students who “made” it in the real world, whom
they admire and want to emulate; the glaring lack of self-identity is completely unnoticed by
these admirers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hazing is a necessity for the bond between institutions and students:&lt;/strong&gt; The presumption with this
argument is that the “Hostel” or the “College” that one attends is an institution whose
relationship with the students who live or study in it is tenuous, like the branches of a tree in
autumn whose branches stand ready to snap at the mildest gust of wind. I think this is true:
Hostels are not endearing places, they are not comfortable, welcoming or well provisioned for
living a &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; life; the food is horrible and the hygiene one wouldn’t write home about. One
might remember the time spent there with nostalgia and affection, one might even visit with
family, but one does not want to go back for an extended period of time. If the bond is
tenuous, &lt;strong&gt;why should one reinforce it through abuse?&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, the fact that one has to resort to
abuse to preserve a bond that would break if left to it’s own devices should give the abuser
pause: What is it that you are trying to achieve by prolonging the bond through such cruel means?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hazing makes people resilient to future hardships:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, on the surface, I admit this is true. In
the pedestrian sense, anything that has been dealt with before is easier to deal with in the
future. If one has dealt with abuse in the past, then they will fare better at dealing with abuse
in the present. Does this tell us that we should intentionally put others through hardship, so
that they might be better prepared for the future? &lt;strong&gt;Of course not&lt;/strong&gt;, that is absurd. As Seneca
reminds us, the stoic aims to remain unaffected no matter what happens by rehearsing the
worst-case scenarios in his mind; this exercise has nothing to do with his experience of those
worse-case scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these justifications leave something to be desired for. They don’t clarify the question. Reading
through these again, I feel a false comfort arising from having enumerated some possible root
causes; I want the reader to be wary of this: We are hovering near the periphery; but we have &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;
found the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-dont-institutions-put-a-stop-to-it&quot;&gt;Why don’t institutions put a stop to it?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functionaries and officials at every college and university know that hazing is going on, and yet
they do nothing. It is well within their power to stamp it out; I am sure there are educational
institutions which have rid themselves of it completely. Why does the average institution stand
silently by?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutions don’t &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;really&lt;/span&gt; care:&lt;/strong&gt; This is not a dig at institutions; rather it’s a dig at
adults in society. As one grows older, all institutions care less and less about them and expect
them to lead an independent, &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;transactional&lt;/span&gt; life. All around the world, discussions about the
social safety net are reaching a fever pitch in the higher income countries; while the merits of
old-age homes are discussed openly in middle-income countries. Ezra Klein’s June 2020 AMA on The
Ezra Klein Show has a poignant quote about this: “From taking care of my son, a toddler, it has
become exceedingly clear to me that we should treat everyone around us the way that we treat
children: When I speak to him, I say the things that would benefit him. I don’t want to be
vindictive; I don’t expect to be treated the way that I treat him; I am able to act with empathy
without having to make a conscious effort to do so” (paraphrased).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutions do care, but they have &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;better&lt;/span&gt; things to do:&lt;/strong&gt; This will be
familiar to people working in Agile teams where “priority” is assigned to every task and some
tasks in the Backlog never get done because they were never “high priority enough”. Most
government-funded colleges are not run very efficiently and they are not under any obligation to
improve their efficiency. My belief is that colleges have a surplus of staff and an unwillingness
to do anything, like governments. A good demonstration of institutions getting their priorities
horribly wrong was the paving of a parking lot at the Mechanical engineering department at IIT
Kharagpur; while the department did not have air conditioning in any of the classrooms or a
decent canteen. Assigning higher priority to the former rather than the latter is a gross misuse
of public funds and a misunderstanding of the majority’s needs. Further, like the members of the
Select committee trying to understand why an expensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIto5mwDLxo&quot;&gt;roof garden&lt;/a&gt; was commissioned by
questioning a bureaucrat, it is impossible to understand this decision. Trying to understand it
have left me only with futile frustration.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutions are delegating some of their work to willing seniors:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a controversial
argument; the gist is that institutions &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; want someone to supervise the new students who are
coming into the campus and ensure that they don’t get into trouble through “too much freedom”
(whatever that is); but they are unable or &lt;strong&gt;unwilling&lt;/strong&gt; to perform this supervisory function and
are delegating it to other students who are willing to &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;take up&lt;/span&gt; this mantle and work for the
institution for free. In return, these seniors are rewarded with positions in the “Student
government” which gives them a false sense of importance which they use to legitimize their
harassment as a “good deed”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Society has given up and accepted the existence of hazing:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the most defeatist
reason. There are several things that we have just accepted, there is not much debate on the
topic because the debates seem to go nowhere and the conclusions are fait accompli: “Yes,
Institutions should put a stop to hazing.”, “Yes, Governments should enact legislation and
seriously pursue punitive action”.  Few have the incentive to become an activist advocating for
these topics as their impact is low in the utilitarian sense: “Just endure it for the first year
of college, it will build character and you will understand more about the real world”, or my
personal favorite, “What you are going through is nothing compared to what &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; went through; so
don’t complain” etc. The other two star examples of this are (a) Governments, everyone is
perpetually unhappy with them, but at least they are passably good at their primary
responsibility, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIYfiRyPi3o&quot;&gt;maintaining stability&lt;/a&gt;, and (b) Economic inequality, everyone acknowledges the
existence of economic inequality and its evils, the activists on the two extremes are screaming
at the top of their voices for either the Free market or Socialism. In this cacophony of voices,
everyone remains unheard and governments don’t have any incentive to take action as they will be
unable to take credit or use it to forge a path to reelection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-do-you-deal-with-hazing&quot;&gt;How do you deal with hazing?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving away from the abstract, this is a question that I want to give a satisfying answer to. I used
3 strategies back in college:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a low profile:&lt;/strong&gt; During the period that you are going to be hazed, make yourself
non-existent. I spent as little time as possible around people I didn’t trust or suspected would
haze me at some point in the future; this includes not becoming too familiar with them (there is
a misconception that if you are familiar with the seniors you will not be harassed as much; I
have found the opposite to be true). Eventually, everyone will get trapped in their net and this
happened to me as my implementation of this strategy was not sound. When seniors went on rounds
through the hostel floor that I was living on and screamed like banshees at juniors for
disrespecting them by not assembling in the common room, I committed an error and made myself
noticeable. I stood up to them and refused to go down to the common room saying I had to “study
for an upcoming examination”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They were not having any of it and I lost that
battle. Retrospectively, it occurred to me that I was reinforcing their power trip by giving them
an opportunity to wield the power for real.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do something worthwhile:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a general suggestion that applies to all the time that one spends at college. During
the period that you are going to be hazed, focus on something worthwhile that is not academics
and not social media. Whatever it might be, it will give you the perspective required to look
past the shortsightedness of the people hazing you and come to terms with how pointless their
exercise is and how pathetic it is that they don’t see that futility. For me, this was
&lt;strong&gt;reading&lt;/strong&gt;. I read a lot of novels during this time (like Dickens’ Great Expectations) and managed
to find solace in the struggles of the protagonists and their clear-eyed opposition of their
fictional tormentors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find and participate in a group with seniors who ridicule hazing:&lt;/strong&gt; At my college, the
seniors who engaged in hazing were a minority of their peers. I found several of their peers who
ridiculed them and let me vent my frustrations to them: What seemed pointless to me, they had
already overcome. I see that they were playing the role of a manager: they were absorbing my
anxieties and frustrations and reflecting back the wisdom that comes with experience and a
broader worldview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Going through immigration at Munich in August 2019, I was asked by the immigration officer to show him that I had the 600 euros, that I claimed to have, for the vacation that I was about to embark upon. An &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;interesting&lt;/span&gt; start to a vacation. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I should have known better than to use an academic reason against people who barely thought about it and believed that anyone who &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;did&lt;/span&gt; think about academics needed to be reformed. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Notes and Review: Letters from a Stoic (Seneca) (Campbell translation)</title>
   <link href="/2021/03/21/letters-stoic-review"/>
   <updated>2021-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/03/21/letters-stoic-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found out about this book after Sreejith wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.ppsreejith.net/notes/book-letters-from-a-stoic/&quot;&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; about it. I knew vaguely about Seneca as
being a philosopher of some kind, but I had not considered reading any of his work before seeing
this note. Now, I have read the book and it is at the top of the list of books that I &lt;strong&gt;strongly
recommend&lt;/strong&gt; to everyone. In this post, I have put together some of the most insightful things that I
think Seneca talks about in this book. This book is a perennial guide to living the life of a “wise
person”: happy, contented, and prepared for whatever fortune might throw their way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book was written in the first century, some 2000 years ago. Going into the book, I expected to
find some references to things that were simply outdated and ancient. But this was not the case at
all: The maladies that Seneca says affect society have remained unchanged through a variety of
events that we believe have changed the world, but which have only changed the &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/span&gt; of
those maladies, without getting rid of them or even altering the underlying anxieties that people
tend to feel in society (envy, fear, contempt, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a book of letters that Seneca rights to his friend and student Lucilius. In these
letters, Seneca gives Lucilius direct advice about how to behave and how to lead a life that is
contented and free of the anxieties that Lucilius or the people around him have probably been
facing. There is a tinge of mystery as we get to see only one side of the communication between
these two men, leading to the reader having to fill in the blank about what it was that Lucilius asked
Seneca for counsel on. This mystery did not hamper my ability to learn from this book, and identify
the “rules” that I can apply to my own life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seneca’s writing (and Campbell’s translation) is &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;fresh&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;lucid&lt;/span&gt;. It is not the &lt;strong&gt;stuffy&lt;/strong&gt;,
&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;intellectual&lt;/span&gt; writing of a philosopher who is trying to find arguments and connect dots that don’t
deserve or need to be connected to gain something new. This is addressed in one of the letters where
Seneca says how philosophy has been reduced to philology, the study of words and how modern
philosophers (modern when the letters were written, i.e. 1-100 AD) were splitting hairs about what a
word means or how a syllogism is inaccurate etc. This meta-theme, “what should philosophy do for the
reader”, can be found in several letters throughout the book and it was one of the important things
that I learned from this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; He has a &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; good sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘Mouse is a syllable, and a mouse nibbles cheese; therefore, a syllable nibbles cheese.’ Suppose for the moment
I can’t detect the fallacy in that. What danger am I placed in by such lack of insight? What serious consequences
are there in it for me? What I have to fear, no doubt, is the possibility, one of these days, of my catching a
syllable in a mousetrap or even having my cheese eaten up by a book if I’m not careful. Unless perhaps the
following train of logic is a more acute one: ‘Mouse is a syllable, and a syllable does not nibble cheese;
therefore, a mouse does not nibble cheese.’ What childish fatuities these are! Is this what we philosophers
acquire wrinkles in our brows for? Is this what we let our beards grow long for? Is this what we teach with faces
grave and pale?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Letter XLVIII (48)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of joke I would not be surprised to find in a Jerry Seinfeld stand-up comedy act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;recurring-themes&quot;&gt;Recurring themes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 themes that recur through the book and are approached from various angles and when
dealing with problems faced by various people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;steel-yourselves-against-misfortune&quot;&gt;Steel yourselves against misfortune&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a member of the Stoic school of philosophy, Seneca is obsessed with how the “wise man” would
react to misfortune, be it in the form of persecution, natural disasters, war, the death of a loved
one or even his own death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His advice is deceptively simple: &lt;strong&gt;Prepare to lose everything you have to the whims of fortune and
yet, continue to live a good life despite the loss&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know about the popularization of this principle (“prepare for the worst, hope for the best”), but
the missing piece in the popularization is the &lt;strong&gt;reason&lt;/strong&gt; one should prepare for the worst. Why should
you prepare for the worst, when the worst is highly unlikely? Why should you hope for the best, when
that is equally unlikely? Wouldn’t the wise man prepare and hope for the usual? If one were to do
that, given the utter randomness of everything, they would be well-prepared for most things and
ill-prepared for the small minority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seneca explains the reason eloquently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For what is there that fortune does not when she pleases fell at the height of its powers? What is
there that is not the more assailed and buffeted by her the more lustrous its attraction? What is
there that is troublesome or difficult for her?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Letter XCI (91)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can know very little about what will happen and to assume that the usual turn of events will
continue for a long period of time is incorrect. In fact, the usual turn of events will only
continue for a limited period of time and the worst thing that you can think of will &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; end up
happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, one’s &lt;strong&gt;goal&lt;/strong&gt; should always be to remain unaffected in the face of the things that happen to them
(good or bad) and the only way to &lt;strong&gt;remain unaffected by anything that happens&lt;/strong&gt; to you is to foresee
the worst possible scenario. The change in my thinking was about this goal. My previous conception
framed the goal of “preparing for the worst” in the next part of the adage, “hope for the best”: I
am hoping for the best because my goal is to get through whatever happens unscathed, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to remain
unaffected irrespective of what happens. Once again, I hand the mic over to Seneca who explains what
our attitude should be: (emphasis added)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is why we need to &lt;strong&gt;envisage every possibility&lt;/strong&gt; and to strengthen the spirit to deal with the
things that may conceivably come about. Rehearse them in your mind: exile, torture, war,
shipwreck. Misfortune may snatch you away from your country, or your country away from you, may
banish you into some wilderness - these very surroundings in which the masses suffocate may become a
wilderness. &lt;strong&gt;All the terms of our human lot should be before our eyes&lt;/strong&gt;; we should be anticipating
not merely all that commonly happens but all the that is &lt;strong&gt;conceivably capable&lt;/strong&gt; of happening, if we
do not want to be overwhelmed and struck numb by rare events as if they were unprecedented ones;
fortune needs envisaging in a thoroughly comprehensive way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Letter XCI (91)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might sound pessimistic to some readers. It felt like the &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;pragmatic&lt;/span&gt; course of action to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;study-philosophy-to-build-a-better-character-not-a-better-intellect&quot;&gt;Study philosophy to build a better character, not a better intellect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a meta thread of reasoning that runs through the book. (As this is a book with philosophical
arguments, the philosophical argument for what the purpose of philosophical arguments are can be
considered to be “meta”). Seneca is convinced that the purpose of philosophy is to &lt;strong&gt;reform&lt;/strong&gt; people’s
characters and make them better people and that it is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to improve the reader’s intellect or
make them look well-read or intelligent to their friends through syllogisms, clever turns of phrase
or “the other toys of sterile intellectual cleverness” (Letter CVIII).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the philosopher’s audience is to “rid oneself of his faults and acquire a rule of
life by which to test his character” (paraphrase from Letter CVIII).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an enlightening concept to me: I have dabbled in the study of philosophy. I have read
&lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; about the core tenets of Nietzsche, Sartre, and Socrates. Admittedly, I did that because I
wanted to give the &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;appearance&lt;/span&gt; of knowing about the different schools of philosophy. I was &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;
looking for something in their arguments that would help me become a better person. I wanted to get
the general lay of the land without any deep idea about specific characteristics of the
landscape. The closest I came to that “active” part of philosophy was watching the TV Show “The Good
Place” and hearing the makers talk about it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2019/12/10/21002589/the-good-place-mike-shur-moral-philosophy-the-ezra-klein-show&quot;&gt;a podcast&lt;/a&gt;. This was an &lt;strong&gt;incorrect&lt;/strong&gt; approach to the
study of philosophy. Indeed, I should have read Sartre because I wanted to understand his
existential argument and think about how it could help me become a better person or update my
reasons about what I should and should not do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this point, the letters give the reader hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is easy enough to arouse in a listener a desire for what is Honorable; for in every one of us
nature has laid the foundations or sown the seeds of the virtues. We are born to them all, all of
us, and when a person comes along with the necessary stimulus, then those qualities of the
personality are awakened, so to speak, from their slumber. Haven’t you noticed how the theater
murmurs agreement whenever something is spoken the truth of which we generally recognize and
unanimously confirm?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Letter CVIII (108)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that a person &lt;strong&gt;has&lt;/strong&gt; come along with the necessary stimulus for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;Side note:&lt;/span&gt; Philosophy gets a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/usage-bad-rap-vs-bad-rep-vs-bad-wrap&quot;&gt;bad rap&lt;/a&gt;, it’s students and practitioners should elevate it’s name
through their wholehearted embrace of it for the right reason: gaining the wisdom required to lead a
life that is “better than the mob”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Avoid shabby attire, long hair, an unkempt beard, an outspoken dislike of silverware, sleeping on the ground and
all other misguided means to self-advertisement. The very name of philosophy, however modest the manner in
which it is pursued, is unpopular enough as it is: imagine what the reaction would be if we started dissociating
ourselves from the conventions of society.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Letter V (5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-expect-a-change-in-surroundings-to-fix-you&quot;&gt;Don’t expect a change in surroundings to &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;fix&lt;/span&gt; you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What good does it do you to go overseas, to move from city to city? If you really want to escape the things that
harass you, what you’re needing is not to be in a different place but to be a different person.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Letter CIV (104)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to be said about the merits of travel and going to a new place. It makes you worldly;
it puts you in a surrounding that you haven’t been before, reducing you to a child, lost and alone;
it lets you see new mountains, landscapes and rivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t expect the change in surroundings to change &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;, even if you don’t put in any effort
yourself. I don’t know if a lot of people travel to get rid of anxiety in the present day. I have
thought about doing this before: When I felt stressed out or suffocated in college, I would go to
Kolkata for a weekend. If I was tightly wound for some reason, then the trip helped me loosen up but
it didn’t help me get rid of the underlying cause of the stress or the suffocation. I was not
surprised by the lack of efficacy; but I was also unable to articulate the reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule on this particular theme is hard to pinpoint and I think it changes depending on who you
are and how much experience you have had. I am looking forward to thinking about what the rule is
for me and how I can apply it in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;not-completely-convinced&quot;&gt;Not completely convinced&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not completely convinced about one point that he brings up in one of his letters. He says that
the recounting of past sufferings and one’s victory over them is a pointless exercise and serves
only to be detrimental to one’s conception of the past, that suffering and one’s spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What’s the good of dragging up sufferings which are over, of being unhappy now just because you were then?
What is more, doesn’t everyone add a good deal to his tale of hardships and deceive himself as well in the
matter? Besides, there is a pleasure in having succeeded in enduring, something the actual enduring of which
was very far from pleasant; when some trouble or other comes to an end the natural thing is to be glad. There are
two things, then, the recollecting of trouble in the past as well as the fear of troubles to come, that I have to root
out: the first is no longer of any concern to me and the second has yet to be so.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Letter LXXVIII (78)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t strongly advocate for thinking or recounting past sufferings. But this particular point
seems to be at loggerheads with something that Seneca advocates for: self-analysis to improve one’s
character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I shall put myself under observation straight away and undertake a review of my day – a course which is of the
utmost benefit. What really ruins our characters is the fact that none of us looks back over his life. We think
about what we are going to do, and only rarely of that, and fail to think about what we have done, yet any plans
for the future are dependent on the past.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Letter LXXXIII (83)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will re-read Seneca’s arguments in these two letters and think some more about what he is talking
about. I suspect that, in the end, I will agree with him (he &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; wise, after-all), I am not
convinced at the current juncture about it though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; I have used Roman numerals here because Seneca himself lived under the Roman empire and uses
 these numerals are used throughout the book. I have put the decimal representation of the numbers
 in parentheses because I found those easier to write and refer to when talking about the letters in
 my notes.&lt;/p&gt;

the analysis is subjective and not based on any &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;standards&lt;/span&gt;. I take a free-form “scoring” approach
to rank the website on some predefined characteristics and then compare those scores. If your
sensibilities do not match my own, this part of the analysis might not hold much value for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clean design scoring definitely exposed something that I was vaguely expecting, but couldn’t
recognize until I had completed my scoring: It brought the sites I like the most to the top, with
some surprising exceptions in the final score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites/graphs/subjective/1-sites-by-subjective-score.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;non-obscure-link-names-for-other-parts-of-the-site-are-important&quot;&gt;Non-obscure link names for other parts of the site are important&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surprising exception that came to the top was CNN. I don’t hold any strong opinions about CNN as
I don’t frequent the site very often. Looking at the screenshots again, I notice that the website
outdoes other websites in the “Useful links to other parts of the site” section. Vox loses on this
metric owing to the structure of Vox.com as a series of “verticals”, which are not very closely
related to news and can be more accurately described as “Special projects”. (e.g. the effective
altruism Vox vertical, Future Perfect).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet is powered by linking several other relevant pages on a highly trafficked page. This
increases the likelihood of people reaching the homepage through search and then going on to other
parts of the site that they find interesting. The Vox method of linking to obscure verticals is
sub-optimal from this point of view. On the other hand, smaller websites do this very
well. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/&quot;&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt; does a very good job in leading people to other parts of the site. They have a
simple navigation bar with links that are &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;very&lt;/span&gt; vanilla: Politics, Sports, Science, Podcasts,
Video. I have used this navigation bar several times, particularly when I want to listen to a
podcast or watch something that they recently put out, without any clear expectation of what topic
that might be related to. It is hard to argue that “Open Sourced”, “Recode”, “The Goods”, or “Future
Perfect” are easier to comprehend. The Print and The Wire, 2 Indian new-age news websites, do a good
job at this too, by sticking to traditional News beats for their navigation bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;most-of-the-websites-are-well-designed&quot;&gt;Most of the websites are well designed&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is controversial, because it is fashionable to rant about bad design and clutter. My experience
with these sites, with Ublock turned on, was pleasant. None of the websites took an inordinate
amount of time to load. The worst offenders were sites with moving elements like countdown timers or
interactive graphs that don’t add anything useful to the user’s experience. Bloomberg’s ticker is
the one element that I haven’t gotten used to despite having used the site for a while now. I am
tempted to say that I don’t think it adds value for any kind of user, professional stock broker or
otherwise, and that it is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/skeuomorphism&quot;&gt;skeuomorphism-based&lt;/a&gt; hold-out from the past when displays were too
expensive to be large enough to show several stock quotes at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News18 was the strangest website on this particular point. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hilariously, Republic World scored a 10/10 on “Clean design” because they chose to put a single
embedded video on their website (I was tempted to give them 11 or 15 for their surprising restraint
on this absolutely irrelevant point, even as their daily news coverage hovers somewhere between
“shouting match” and “I can’t believe this is news”). Of course, the website with the cleanest
design is one that is completely empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;non-news-ctas-are-bad-for-the-user&quot;&gt;Non-news CTAs are bad for the user&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is a &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;no-brainer&lt;/span&gt;. A news website shouldn’t mess with the reader’s experience with
unnecessary ads of campaigns that Indian TV news channels are major sponsors / participants of (NDTV
started this practice a few years ago with their “Save the Tiger” campaign which was widely
applauded by animal rights activists and became the &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;vogue&lt;/span&gt; thing to do if you are a news channel
with a meaningful audience). Most of the websites I looked at have the “Subscribe” CTA. Given that
these websites have very few avenues of making money if most of their users have ad-blockers
installed, this is a necessary evil and must be forgiven by the responsible consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for links to Twitter / Facebook / foobarbaz, I doubt that these are required. I can find CNN on
Twitter. If I want to mention NDTV on Twitter, I will type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@NDTV&lt;/code&gt; and select the first suggestion
from Twitter that has the verified check mark. I think most other users will do the same. I doubt
that any Twitter user will go from NDTV.com to Twitter.com/NDTV and then tap on the Tweet button. My
intuition is that at some point in the past, product managers of the NDTV.com website decided to add
these CTAs to their site and that they didn’t run A/B tests to see if these new CTAs drove any
engagement. Removing code is harder than adding it into a large repository, because anything that is
in the repository quickly used in unexpected ways by other developers. This probably
dis-incentivised them from removing these CTAs later (This is all rank speculation, pay no mind to
it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last, we come to News18. This is the part of the analysis where I slightly started to lose my
patience because News18.com is just not a good place to read anything. It faired poorly in the
objective analysis because there was a lot of Clickbait and a lot of Entertainment news. Apart from
the News articles, the site has nearly 10 other CTAs. These say things like “Watch Live TV”,
“Download News18 App” (inexplicably shown on a desktop browser), “Follow” the site on social media
etc. There’s also some sort of campaign that is asking you to take a pledge to save water
today. There’s a &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;strange&lt;/span&gt; “COVID tracker” where the word “COVID” is replaced by a rendering of the
many-pronged “virus”. I seriously hope that you never have to tap on any link that leads you to this
homepage, as one can only get more confused from the barrage of irrelevant information that’s
presented on it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>An Unscientific Comparison of News Websites - Part 2 (Objective Analysis)</title>
   <link href="/2021/03/14/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites-2-objective-analysis"/>
   <updated>2021-03-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/03/14/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites-2-objective-analysis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This series of posts looks at 13 news website home pages and compares them at a single point in
time, based on the content that they host and the presentation of that content to the common
user. This is the second post in this series and it looks objectively at the &lt;strong&gt;content and
classification&lt;/strong&gt; of the articles on each web page. We look at the various websites and try to
classify why some news websites are clearly “good” while others are “tolerable” at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming note:&lt;/strong&gt; (Post 1: released yesterday, Post 2: this post, Post 3: March 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After counting and classifying each news article on the News home pages, I eyeballed the data and
some graphs. I came up with three insights that I think are instrumental in making a website good,
based on the kind of content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;quality-and-quantity-are-equally-important-for-the-most-part-anyway&quot;&gt;Quality and quantity are equally important (for the most part, anyway)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites/graphs/objective/1-sites-by-total-news-articles.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by the results, but then I realized that Times Now seemed to be winning simply
because they had crammed a huge amount of news articles onto the available space on their
website. To penalize the websites that put articles on their site as fillers for the available
space, I added a negative weight to 2 categories: Entertainment articles get a weight of -1 and
Click bait articles get a weight of -2. All other articles get the same weight (= 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites/graphs/objective/2-sites-by-news-articles-count-weighted.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one looks at the weighted score, i.e. the sum of all news articles after subtracting the
penalties for including entertainment and clickbait articles on the home page, the websites reorder
themselves and the reputed websites clearly show their higher caliber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites/graphs/objective/3-sites-by-weighted-scores.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, even in this ordering, Times Now is quite high, scoring the same as the venerable
Washington Post and slightly less than the paper of record, The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key &lt;strong&gt;insight&lt;/strong&gt; here is that quality and quantity go hand-in-hand. Websites like Bloomberg and NYT
put a lot of information on the home page, which in turn lets the user decide what path they want to
follow into the website. They don’t clutter their home page with Entertainment or Clickbait. They
give the user a wide variety of content and statistically increase the chances that a reader will
find something of interest and stay on the site. Times Now chooses the same strategy but mixes in a
few clickbait-y articles. If you want to put clickbait on your home page, be sure to cram it as much
as possible with non-clickbait, quality content to retain the experience of the serious
visitor. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t be a tabloid website&lt;/strong&gt; is a succinct expression of the same thought (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html&quot;&gt;A sample tabloid
website&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New-age websites like Vox and Newslaundry go for quality-only and put a select few articles on their
home page. For instance, Newslaundry, the Indian new-age mediahouse, only puts 6 articles on the
homepage. In my opinion, this is an inefficient use of expensive space on the homepage. Any
potential subscriber who comes to the homepage must be presented with about 10-15 news articles from
a variety of genres increasing the chances that they are able to find &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;at least one article&lt;/span&gt; that
will lead to them clicking and reading it. Obviously, the more time they spend on the site, the
higher the chances that they becoming a returning visitor or a subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;websites-cater-to-their-audience&quot;&gt;Websites cater to their audience&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at just the non-entertainment and click-bait articles, the target audience of each website
can be guessed fairly reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites/graphs/objective/4-sites-by-articles-excluding-ent-clickbait.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg has the most stories in the Economy category, while CNN and Washington Post have the most
stories in the Domestic and Government categories. NYT has a dedicated “Opinion” section on it’s
right sidebar, denoting the exalted place occupied by Opinion columnists in the NYT
world. Strikingly, new-age news websites don’t feature much variety on their website. Vox has a wide
catalog and on their YouTube channel, they have explored a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx-KrvuiafE&quot;&gt;huge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf3ER5Ope_s&quot;&gt;variety&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgJyhKEZ8QU&quot;&gt;subjects&lt;/a&gt;. But they have
chosen not to highlight this on their homepage, deciding to stick to Domestic stories from the US
and Opinion columns. Newslaundry and The Wire also stick to old-fashioned Domestic and Government
stories, rather than using their autonomy to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it is clear that most websites based outside India don’t highlight sports on their home page
at all. This is perhaps due to the tendency of sports fans to get their news from hyper-focused
Sports sites, rather than plain-old news sites. The advantage of putting Sports stories on the home
page is debatable for NDTV and Times Now. They should probably add a prominent link to their Sports
section in the navigation bar and remove any Sports stories from their home pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;none-of-the-websites-have-too-much-clickbait&quot;&gt;None of the websites have too much clickbait&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the Entertainment and Clickbait articles, it is clear that none of the websites have &lt;strong&gt;too
much&lt;/strong&gt; clickbait. This was a surprising finding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites/graphs/objective/5-sites-by-ent-clickbait-articles-count.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a percentage of the total stories on the website, the number looks even better. Even the worst
website, News18, uses only 25% of the available space for these articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites/graphs/objective/6-sites-by-ent-clickbait-articles-percentage.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, far be it from me to declare that media houses understand that clickbait is &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;annoying&lt;/span&gt; and that
they are trying their best to balance the Click-Through Rate and Clicks Per Million dollar figure
against their instinctive ideal to do &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;good journalism&lt;/span&gt; and report on stories that the reader will
find useful, especially when the reader next finds themselves in a voting booth. Fortunately, even
the most pessimistic reading of these numbers leads me to believe that clickbait does not make up
the majority of articles that these media houses publish on the Internet. This indicates at the
&lt;strong&gt;remote&lt;/strong&gt; possibility that the TV production crew at these media houses is more focused on producing
sensational coverage when compared to the newsroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; I am writing this article on 14th March, 2021, just as the Oprah interview with Harry and
Meghan news story is picking up steam. All the major media houses have written almost identical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/world/europe/oprah-interview-harry-meghan.html&quot;&gt;news
articles&lt;/a&gt; on the topic. There’s very little information left to share with readers who are just
waiting for the other shoe to drop. The coverage of this story has been surprisingly low-key and
levelheaded. Bloomberg ignored the story, while Vox and NYT published opinion and detail pieces
about some of the words that Meghan used in the interview, while India’s NDTV published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/the-royal-soap-oprah-and-meghans-kahaani-by-shobhaa-de-2386799?pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories&quot;&gt;a snarky
opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; from Shobaa De. It is unclear at this point which of the following scenarios will play
out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The story has not caught on yet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am not checking the right places (Twitter, the town square where &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;ignorant&lt;/span&gt; spectators have a
lively, &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;informed&lt;/span&gt; debate)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The story will never become too big because it’s just not as interesting when people are stuck at
home and looking for an adrenaline rush (like the one from stock trading), rather than a gossip
story, which they used to simmer down and get away from stress in the past&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am way off the mark and the story is not being reported in a “low-key, levelheaded” fashion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am attached to option (3) above and would prefer it to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>An Unscientific Comparison of News Websites - Part 1 (Motivation and Methodology)</title>

   <updated>2021-03-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/03/13/unscientific-comparison-of-news-websites-1-motivation-and-methodology</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This series of posts looks at 13 news website home pages and compares them at a single point in time
based on the content that they host and the presentation of that content to the common user. This is
the first of three posts for this series. It explains my motivation and the methodology that I used
for this comparison. I took screenshots of the above-the-fold content on 13 popular news websites at
a single point in time. Then, I &lt;strong&gt;counted&lt;/strong&gt; the total number of news articles on each site and
&lt;strong&gt;classified&lt;/strong&gt; each one into various categories. I also did a &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;subjective&lt;/span&gt; analysis of the site’s
&lt;strong&gt;look and feel&lt;/strong&gt; by ranking them between 1 and 10 on 4 metrics (I came up with these metrics using my
expectations from news websites as a guide). Once again, this is &lt;strong&gt;an unscientific comparison study&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming note:&lt;/strong&gt; (Post 1: Current post, Post 2: March 14, Post 3: March 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a series of 3 posts. This is the first post in the series. The other two posts will be
released tomorrow (March 14th) and the day after (March 15th).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Objective analysis: Results and Insights (March 14th)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subjective analysis: Results and Insights (March 15th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been visiting a few news websites regularly for the past 3-4 years. The New York Times
website was the first one I started visiting regularly, after subscribing to the “Daily Briefing”
email and finding interesting articles on it almost everyday. With the rise of podcasts, I come
across new articles that authors and hosts talk about on podcasts, which in turn introduces me to
new news websites (that is how I found out about FiveThirtyEight). Some websites are very good and I
return to them often; others, not so much. This gave rise to the key question that this analysis
tries to answer: &lt;strong&gt;What makes a news website good and worth returning to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are two parts to the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, at considerable risk of stating the obvious, the website should contain &lt;strong&gt;factual, reported,
interesting&lt;/strong&gt; news content. I add the epithet “interesting” here because news websites are not wire
services (like Reuters or the Associated Press) which simply report the latest fact without any
context. They serve the role of an “intelligent aggregator” sitting between the primary source of
information (wire service, polling company or research paper) and the layperson. Nearly always, the
reader will want to be caught up to the information already known and how the information being
reported affects the story (Note that I saw “nearly always” here because some of the stories need
little context. On the 2021-03-13, &lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt; in the world knows about COVID19 and hence one needs
little or no context in a story that explains a new vaccine development). Sometimes, the layperson
might want to dig further into a topic, the website should encourage and facilitate this desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the website should &lt;strong&gt;present&lt;/strong&gt; content in a &lt;strong&gt;pleasing, easy-to-read manner&lt;/strong&gt;. This is clearly
subjective: one person’s easy-to-consume is another person’s bland or unimaginative or lazy. Here, I
should clarify “easy-to-read” is not talking about the language that is used (e.g. should be at
8th-grade or lower reading level etc). Rather, it denotes the &lt;strong&gt;aesthetic presentation&lt;/strong&gt; of content
and the &lt;strong&gt;consistency and restraint&lt;/strong&gt; that the website shows in using technology to deliver news to
the user. If there are a huge variety of colors that don’t conform to a single color palette OR if
there are multiple fonts on the website, that makes the website &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt; “easy-to-read”. On the other
hand, if the website uses one of the standard presentation formats, with a single font and a few
&lt;strong&gt;meaningful font sizes&lt;/strong&gt; and has no adhoc elements added for special events, that makes it &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt;
“easy-to-read”. To give this series’ readers the utmost flexibility, I have taken care to ensure
that the Objective and Subjective analyses are distinct in this series. If your tastes are not in
line with mine, please ignore the subjective part of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;screenshots&quot;&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose 13 popular news websites and took a screenshot of their home page at 1 pm UTC on
10th February, 2021. I added Vox to the list some time later, so that screenshot was taken at 2 pm UTC
on 7th March, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The screenshots were taken on a sufficiently wide screen, which ensured that most websites didn’t
use all the horizontal space available&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I opened the websites on Firefox with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/&quot;&gt;Ublock extension&lt;/a&gt; for blocking ads and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/&quot;&gt;Ghostery
extension&lt;/a&gt; for blocking analytics enabled&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I didn’t look at any “popular website” ranking to arrive at this list and simply chose the top
websites that were at the top of my mind when I thought of “news website comparison”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can check the screenshots that I took through the Screenshot column in the following table&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have inadvertently included an almost identical number of American and Indian websites&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional news organizations are the ones that have been around for a relatively long period of
time and have an approach to news that has remained largely unchanged for the past 40-50 years, even
as the medium for delivery might have changed considerably. The New York Times and Washington Post
are the stalwarts in this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New-age news organizations are those that don’t depend on traditional funding patterns of news
(e.g. advertisements, product placements), instead choosing to sell subscriptions or taking a
radically different approach to monetization (e.g. partnership with companies like Netflix). Vox is
the flag holder for this group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also included 2 Indian websites, Republic TV and Times Now, which are generally known for
their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK7y3OsKQzY&quot;&gt;entertainment-disguised-as-journalism&lt;/a&gt; approach to the nightly news.  I wanted to see if these
had &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; websites or if their TV production was more sensational by some basic necessity of that
medium. I found some interesting results; particularly with Times Now which ranked high due to
meaningful news on the website and hardly any clickbait stories (This points to the &lt;strong&gt;remote&lt;/strong&gt;
possibility that their production team for TV news is doing sensationalist journalism and that is
not representative of their newsroom).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;objective-analysis-count-and-classify&quot;&gt;Objective analysis: Count and classify&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyze these sites objectively, I counted the total number of News stories on each website and
classified each one into one of the following 8 categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Domestic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;International&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Government&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Economy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entertainment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clickbait&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Domestic” refers to the country of origin for each news organization. i.e. the same article about a
policy decision from the Indian government will be classified as “Government” for NDTV whereas it
will be classified as “International” for Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Entertainment” is the section which would contains news about the film industry or celebrities. I
have classified news about arts and music into “Other”. This is in line with my own sensibility
that the film industry being a relative newcomer to the world of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinion-pieces and podcasts are classified in the Other section. Some websites have dedicated
“Opinion” reporters and they are given prominent positions on their websites (Bloomberg, NYT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the counting and the classification, I calculated the weighted score for each website. During
this calculation, I gave a negative weight to “Entertainment” (-1) and “Clickbait” (-2) stories as
these are (in my opinion) intrusive, don’t serve any clear purpose and don’t educate the user. In
particular, stories like &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/virat-kohli-anushka-sharma-join-wriddhiman-saha-in-his-sons-birthday-party-2385651?pfrom=home-ndtv_lateststories&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;objectively bad&lt;/strong&gt; for the reader, because they serve as a
distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the attentive reader might have noticed, the weighted score doesn’t have any upper limit.  Hence,
one must resort to subjective comparisons of different parts of the score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;subjective-analysis-look-and-feel&quot;&gt;Subjective analysis: Look and feel&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyze the look and feel of these sites, I scored these websites on a scale of 1-10 on these 4
metrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean design&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A widely debated term, getting it right is impossible. As a reference, I believe that the
front pages of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/torvalds/linux&quot;&gt;the repository page&lt;/a&gt; of GitHub follow the principles of
“Clean design”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;On the other hand, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/br/residencial-salsalito.html?aid=304142;label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaGyIAQGYATG4ARnIAQ_YAQHoAQH4AQKIAgGoAgS4ApPmk4IGwAIB0gIkYTFjOTNiMDMtNTRkYS00MzQ5LThlM2YtN2M3NzBiY2ZiNWE02AIF4AIB;sid=fedd8dec75c67eb4ee0b981b7d15d208;dest_id=-666610;dest_type=city;dist=0;from_beach_non_key_ufi_sr=1;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=2;hpos=2;nflt=ht_id%3D212%3Bht_id%3D210%3Bht_id%3D228%3Bht_id%3D229%3Bht_id%3D214%3Bht_id%3D213%3Bht_id%3D223%3Bht_id%3D216%3Bht_id%3D201%3Bht_id%3D219%3Bht_id%3D208%3Bht_id%3D232%3Bht_id%3D230%3Bht_id%3D224%3Bht_id%3D227%3Bht_id%3D209%3Bht_id%3D215%3Bht_id%3D222%3Bht_id%3D220;no_rooms=1;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;srepoch=1615131426;srpvid=c8566dd09fc20087;type=total;ucfs=1&amp;amp;#hotelTmpl&quot;&gt;Booking.com hotel page&lt;/a&gt; is a prime example of a utilitarian page which
doesn’t adhere to the “Clean design” ideals and crams too much functionality into a single web
page (e.g. Learning that a room at this hotel was booked 2 minutes ago helps Booking.com get
to the viewers “FOMO” and helps them make a sale; it leaves the viewer in a decidedly worse
state when compared to their self before they arrived at this web page as the only two options
left to them are to be swindled out of their money or to leaving the page with the anxiety
that the room will not be available a few minutes hence)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distractions&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Print newspapers are the holy grail: They have distractions in the form of advertisements but
these are placed in well-defined blocks and easily skipped / ignored.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Modern websites have taken to putting up marquees, counters, count-downs to events,
interactive graphs, icons and a lot more on their homepages which ostensibly serve to let the
viewer know that they are on a “dynamic” website. None of these are related to news in any
way, do not make the presentation any better by their conspicuous presence and don’t add any
value for the common user&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Useful links to other parts of the site&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;News home pages should serve as jumping off points which can be used by readers to reach other
parts of the site that they are interested in. If the website doesn’t provide this
functionality, then people will have to use external search engines&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;On a philosophical level, the lack of useful links on the home page indicates at a low
expectation of longevity from each viewer&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-news calls-to-action&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Things that lead to affliate websites, ads, other websites run by the same company, CTAs that
go to social media etc are non-news CTAs&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The “Subscribe” CTA is a key part of the website and I don’t consider that a non-news CTA if
the news organization runs on the subscription model&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each case, 1 is bad and 10 is good. i.e. 10 denotes extremely clean design, the least amount of
distractions, several useful links to other parts of the site and the least amount of non-news
CTAs. This part of the analysis gives us a score between 4 and 40 for each website. This score tells
us how good the website &lt;strong&gt;feels&lt;/strong&gt; to a user who has the same expectations from news websites as my
own&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note about the scoring:&lt;/strong&gt; After I completed the scoring, I realized that the scores were on the high
end of the spectrum as they varied between 22 and 40, out of a maximum score of 40. This was
probably because my scoring was &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;accomodative&lt;/span&gt; and I didn’t take a stricter view of the minor quirks
in some web pages. A more detailed analysis which looks at each component carefully and preferably
done by someone who has real UX and Design experience would lead to a better Subjective
analysis. Nevertheless, I decided to go with what I had for this iteration of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Financial Markets are Complex</title>
   <link href="/2021/02/18/gamestop-early-2021-mania"/>
   <updated>2021-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/02/18/gamestop-early-2021-mania</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GME:US&quot;&gt;Gamestop stock&lt;/a&gt; started 2021 at a modest $17.25. It then went up to $347.51 on 27th January. It
went back down to $53.50 on 4th February. It closed on February 17th at $45.94, about 2.66 times
it’s price at the start of the year. Millions of words and thousands of column inches have been
devoted to explaining what happened, why it happened, and who was hurt. I wanted to write about a
few peculiar things I noticed in the past few days that were the bizarre side shows to the main
event: politicians (and Elon Musk) posturing for publicity by saying things about other things that
they know nothing about, truth not prevailing no matter how much effort is spent on explanation,
general disapproval of complexity in a system and societal conviction that the stock market is
“rigged”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/game-stop-early-2021-stock.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;politicians-posturing-for-publicity&quot;&gt;Politicians posturing for publicity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politicians in the US tweeted about this and claimed to fight for the “little guy” and question
Robinhood. Surprisingly (for me), they didn’t do their homework and were caught saying things that
made little sense. Elizabeth Warren was a notable exception and no wonder; a veteran policy maker
with deep knowledge of the stock market, she made a very good case in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/01.29.2021%20Letter%20from%20Senator%20Warren%20to%20Acting%20Chair%20Lee.pdf&quot;&gt;her letter to the SEC&lt;/a&gt;. Elon
Musk is not a politician, but his posturing for publicity is no different from other politicians,
and he was able to fuel the mania effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might not come as a surprise to some readers. Politicians say outrageous things because it gets
them air time. Reality shows are a close parallel that might help us understand this phenomenon and
&lt;strong&gt;teach us how to correct our reaction&lt;/strong&gt; for this “posturing bias”. Indian reality shows like
Splitsvilla and Roadies often have contestants whining about another contestant “grabbing
footage”. These reality shows are inspired by American reality shows like The Bachelor and Roadies
USA. The motivation for most people who go on these shows is to become famous or to make it in the
Indian film industry. Their most effective way of doing that is by doing something outrageous and
getting noticed by producers and casting directors who are skimming through thousands of portfolios
to find the person who will play the lead or supporting role in their next venture. These shows are
notoriously bad at turning contestants into actors: The only person who can be considered a success
for the Roadies =&amp;gt; Film industry path was Ayushmann Khurana, in the more than nearly 15 years that
these shows have been running on television. This low success rate has dampened the popularity of
these shows, but they continue to live on as zombie versions of their old popular selves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the effective strategies to correct for posturing bias can be seen in action in reality
shows, when other contestants wake up to the footage grabbing behavior of one of their
co-contestants and begin to isolate them from their plotting. This inevitably leads to a loud
showdown between various factions of contestants and ends with some people getting “eliminated” from
the show. Now, irrespective of whether the footage-grabbing contestant left the show, this sudden
blow-up changes the dynamics and the group re-aligns around some other contestant. As a viewer, this
is a great “reset point”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can apply this strategy to politicians: &lt;strong&gt;tune out their opinions and look at their past
actions&lt;/strong&gt;. This is hard to do because the number of mediums that politicians can use to reach people
has grown exponentially; talking heads on TV can talk about any subject for hours on end because
there is no real expertise that is required for their job and their lack of such expertise allows
them to talk with unflinching confidence even when they know nothing about the topic. Most media
coverage does not cover what politicians did, rather preferring to cover the process that they were
using or what groups they are aligned with or what their latest speech said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if one wants to figure out what a politician actually did, one really has to dig into their
legislative record. Personally, I have found this process of digging around to find out how a
politician has performed to be rewarding as it has helped clear up my misguided beliefs. (&lt;strong&gt;E.g.&lt;/strong&gt;
Since Kejriwal got elected as the Chief minister of Delhi about 5 years ago, I was a staunch
believer that he was an ineffective leader and that he had failed the people of Delhi. I believed
this without any evidence or lived experience. When he won re-election, I was forced to challenge my
views. This lead to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/government/how-fiscally-prudent-is-delhis-aap-government-really&quot;&gt;discovery&lt;/a&gt; that I had been &lt;strong&gt;completely wrong&lt;/strong&gt; in my belief)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of researching the politicians past actions and figuring out how much of what they talk
about has turned into action is time consuming and requires you to break down some of the internal
barriers that give information that is learned earlier more importance that information that is
added later on. Nevertheless, this is an effective method to reject propaganda and attention-seeking
statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;truth-does-not-eventually-prevail&quot;&gt;Truth does not “eventually” prevail&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief that truth will eventually prevail, the past 5 years have been proof that
that is not a feature of the world that we now inhabit. With respect to GameStop, this was clearly
in the information about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop&quot;&gt;clearing houses&lt;/a&gt; demanding collateral from Robinhood not getting through to
anyone, even people who were closely tracking the developments. When the mania started to die down
and politicians shifted into their “posture by claiming to do something” mode, contention started
going around about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-05/robinhood-gamestop-saga-pressures-payment-for-order-flow&quot;&gt;payment for order flow&lt;/a&gt; and what it meant. Everyone disregarded the explanation
that people who had worked in the financial markets were trying to communicate to others and instead
started rallying against it, despite it being the reason that brokers like Robinhood were able to
give trading services at 0 trading fee to their users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem is harder to effectively solve; while one might be tempted to offer up “Do your own
research” as a strategy, I am skeptical that the truth can actually prevail when we are talking
about binary representations (truth/lie) of complex situations. Particularly, depending on the case,
the two situations could be so close to each other that it is hard for a rational observer to parse
the facts and reach the same conclusion every single time. 13 years removed from the Economic crisis
of 2008, we can say with a fair amount of certainty that the folks at Standard &amp;amp; Poor were not
rating the financial instruments they were seeing fairly. But this is simply one piece of the
puzzle; within the complexity of the financial system, several other players and forces are hidden
and one person would not be able to understand the full scope despite spending unreasonable amounts
of time reading / researching the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, that is not to say that I am defeatist on this. The strategy that I have found useful is
to limit your media diet: Focus on secondary sources that you trust as sources of &lt;strong&gt;verifiable
information&lt;/strong&gt; and depend on primary sources as &lt;strong&gt;sources of detailed information&lt;/strong&gt; about the
topic. &lt;strong&gt;E.g.&lt;/strong&gt; News reports on Bloomberg would be sources of verifiable information about the state of
the economy in a given country, but if I wanted to find out about unemployment or the reasons for
unemployment in a particular sector of the economy, I would have to read research papers, surveys
and government reports which can be considered primary sources because they are much closer to
reality than News reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;general-disapproval-of-complexity&quot;&gt;General disapproval of complexity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occam’s razor provides an articulate argument for rejecting complexity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be
selected
– &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/awesome-social-science#occams-razor&quot;&gt;https://github.com/icyflame/awesome-social-science#occams-razor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my day job as a software engineer, I eschew complexity at every step along the way. I have heard
that this is a good principle when designing large, distributed systems which tend to have several
points of failure and an increase in complexity compounds the various causes of failure and prevents
effective investigation, despite one’s certainty that there &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a problem that needs to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;real world&lt;/span&gt; is not a software engineering design problem. There is no limit to the
complexity that can be attained with fairly simple systems whose dynamics are linear and well
understood in some cases, but can quickly become non-linear and chaotic (&lt;strong&gt;E.g.&lt;/strong&gt; pendulums that enter
a chaotic state when the forcing frequency is slightly different from the natural frequency). So,
one of the contracts that we must maintain with the real world is &lt;strong&gt;the active acceptance of
complexity in the systems that we interact with&lt;/strong&gt;: bureaucracies, economy, healthcare, education. All
of these systems includes hundreds of thousands of people and to expect any of those systems to be
something that can be explained in a news article, YouTube video, or book is irrational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gamestop episode has shown that complexity is not palatable to most people. In particular, the
minority of minds that are vulnerable to conspiracy theories look at the workings of a complex
system, that is way beyond the comprehension of a single person and see a vast conspiracy that is
making the system do things that it was not “meant” to do (like a large bureaucracy with intertwined
departments). Admittedly, they have little evidence about what the conspiracy is or who is pulling
the levers, but they have a convenient and rational escape for this line of reasoning: The system
itself is keeping the “truth” from observers because it is in the system’s interest to do so. Once
the initial threshold of irrationality is crossed, the line of reasoning becomes rational and easy
to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, this problem is hard to solve, even on a personal level. I am not sure how to correct
for this anti-complexity bias when the problem is known to be complex (&lt;strong&gt;E.g.&lt;/strong&gt; Global warming). The
urge to assign blame to invisible sources is quite high and everyone has to struggle with the
uncomfortable state of accepting that a system that one is participating in is beyond one’s
comprehension or accepting the “simpler” solution of a conspiracy that explains the complexity as an
orchestrated illusion. I advocate for the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conviction-that-the-market-is-rigged&quot;&gt;Conviction that the market is “rigged”&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This amazing quote from a recent article perfectly summarizes this conviction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s another episode similar to those past ones of the public feeling like there are multiple
things wrong here — not really knowing what is exactly wrong, but just feeling like something is not
working. It’s just a general popular sense that a system wherein this kind of scenario can come to
pass, just fundamentally doesn’t work for the public and it is ‘rigged,’ or something else, but they
know something is wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened with Gamestop is a variation of the widely known “pump-and-dump” scheme: People buy a
stock they know is worthless, pushing it’s price to a value that doesn’t make any fundamental
sense. In a classic pump-and-dump scheme, the people who pushed the value up will dump the stock at
a peak point that they pick. In this scheme, most of the buyers have held on to their stock. Their
reasons seem to be a mix of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.vn/afl44#selection-2814.0-2814.1&quot;&gt;“It was fun and I wanted to be a part of it”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.vn/l6U6s#selection-5248.0-5248.1&quot;&gt;“It’s like gambling. Also,
YOLO (You Only Live Once)”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.vn/2021.02.02-233313/https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/02/gamestop-stock-plunge-losers/#selection-735.143-735.289&quot;&gt;“I get Reddit Karma when I post a photo that shows losses”&lt;/a&gt;. Putting
that aside for a bit, what happened with Gamestop is not a revolutionary insight into market
operation. It is a mundane methodology which can be used to push the price of any instrument up
(Musk is at it with BTC: BTC is at &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD&quot;&gt;a new all-time high&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;again&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, now, what is the argument behind the “market is rigged” thesis? As far as I can tell, it
is a variation of the argument that retail investors are not as good at making money as
institutional investors. Colloquially known as “the house always wins”. I don’t think this is
true. I will analyze it from two points of view: Process and Resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process:&lt;/strong&gt; Retail investors, who have money that they want to invest into the stock market, can
invest just as institutional investors do. Buffett’s principle of “Value Investing” is one theory of
doing that: One can look at a public company’s financial reports, recent news, governance structures
etc and decide whether one wants to invest in it. The process is &lt;strong&gt;not different for institutional
and retail investors&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, retail investors are unable to do some things like “shorting a stock” or
purchasing government bonds from foreign governments directly. But these are mostly related to a
particular instrument and not a feature of the market itself (i.e. Institutions don’t want to let
retail investors short stock because if the retail investor doesn’t pay or is unable to pay to buy
the stock back at a later date, the institutional investor will be on the hook for this money).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Institutional investors have a major advantage at buying and selling on the stock
market: It is &lt;strong&gt;their job&lt;/strong&gt;. People who work at investment banks and hedge funds have spent several
years understanding how markets work and how to turn a profit using that knowledge. To begrudge them
their expertise seems unwise and petty. In terms of resources, they clearly beat the retail
investor: A retail investor clearly has less time &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; they have much less money to take the risky
bets that institutional investors can sustain. I don’t think this is anything even &lt;strong&gt;close to&lt;/strong&gt; the
market being rigged. In fact, it simply points to the fact that the market rewards expertise and
that capitalism rewards capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most retail investors, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/warren-buffett-recommends-index-funds-for-most-investors?op=1&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; investment strategy is to invest in “Index funds”. Now,
considering that most normal people will do something like that, I think the “market is rigged
against normal people” thesis loses even more ground because it is rarely in the interest of average
investors to pick individual stocks and invest in them, rather than investing in Index funds &lt;strong&gt;(Not
investment advice)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A useful example for this might be to ask yourself if something else is rigged, by this same
logic. &lt;strong&gt;For e.g.&lt;/strong&gt; Someone who wants to play Tennis or Golf will have a big advantage if their
parents have the time and money to go to various tournaments, hire a good coach, buy the right
equipment, regularly drive them to practice sessions and so on, their chances of success at the
sport go up exponentially. Does this mean that the sport is rigged against people who don’t have
these resources? In my opinion, the answer is YES; I just don’t feel as strongly about leveling that
playing field as strongly as I feel about something like poverty in various countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to end this analysis of the various players in the landscape today with a quote from
the journalist Matt Levine. His newsletter “Money Stuff” has been an incredibly valuable resource as
I have tried to understand what really happened, and why it is only history repeating itself and not
some &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/take/history/covid19/2021/02/12/the-previous-year-take/&quot;&gt;unprecedented&lt;/a&gt; event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don’t think, however many days we are into this nonsense, that GameStop is a particularly
important story (though of course it’s a fun one!), or that it points to any deep problems in the
financial markets. There have been bubbles, and corners, and short squeezes, and pump-and-dumps
before. It happens; stuff goes up and then it goes down; prices are irrational for a while;
financial capitalism survives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Matt Levine, the “Money Stuff” newsletter

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S. 1:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the articles linked above is a dailymail.co.uk article. I couldn’t find a similar
article on other websites so I decided to bite the bullet and link an archived version of that

   <title>2020 Was Not "Unprecedented"</title>
   <link href="/2021/02/12/the-previous-year-take"/>
   <updated>2021-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/02/12/the-previous-year-take</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“2020 was an unprecedented year because …”. All of us can find several phrases to complete that
sentence. Versions of this quote have been circulating for more than a year. In particular, creators
on YouTube and News announcers love this quote; every turn in the economy and the things they are
able to / unable to do in their lives is “unprecedented”. In her book “This Time Is Different”,
Reinhart makes the argument that there is &lt;strong&gt;a compulsive urge&lt;/strong&gt; to claim that the present is
completely different from the past, that there are no similarities and that whatever challenge /
victory came &lt;strong&gt;yesterday&lt;/strong&gt; is different and more significant than something that happened a &lt;strong&gt;10 years
ago&lt;/strong&gt;. Reinhart rejects this practice of turning every &lt;strong&gt;insight&lt;/strong&gt; into an &lt;strong&gt;epiphany&lt;/strong&gt; and points to the
fact that the same type of financial crises keep happening, over and over again, to demonstrate that
the present is no more special than the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened in the &lt;strong&gt;first 20 years of the 21st Century&lt;/strong&gt;: devastating terrorist attacks in
several major cities across the world (New York, London, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Boston, Paris), wars in
several countries in the Middle East, the recognition of a possible climate crisis that could have
very bad outcomes for countries that don’t have the resources to adapt, encroachment into sovereign
countries by ambitious states that aim to expand their sphere of influence, the rise of the Internet
and the substantial increase in Internet penetration across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot happened in the &lt;strong&gt;20th Century&lt;/strong&gt;: 2 World wars, a deadly epidemic (Spanish Flu), a prolonged
period of heightened tensions and anxiety, decline of monarchies and the rise of democracies,
collapse of the colonial powers and freedom in their colonies, the discovery of significant crude
oil deposits in the Middle East, rise of the personal computer, numerous healthcare breakthroughs,
highly integrated world trade and an increase in the average number of allies of a country (2.5
1900-1950, 10.5 1950-2000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot happened in the &lt;strong&gt;19th Century&lt;/strong&gt;: 17 major wars between 1815 and 1914 in Europe alone, the
persecution of colonies by colonial powers, Japan went through the Meiji restoration and expanded
it’s empire into Korea and parts of China, Jane Austen wrote some of her best novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot happened in the &lt;strong&gt;18th Century:&lt;/strong&gt; 33 major wars between 1715 and 1815, the founding of America
as a constitutional democracy, …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the events from memory, references in the books I read over the past few
months, and my experience since 2005. Historians would be able to lay out these centuries in a more
logical, articulate manner (They would also be able to remember more things that happened in the
18th century, where my memory has not served me well). My argument here is that &lt;strong&gt;things happen all
the time&lt;/strong&gt;. They happened 300 years ago, and they happened yesterday. One should undoubtedly look at
the things that are happening in one’s life as events from which &lt;strong&gt;unique insights&lt;/strong&gt; can be garnered,
but one should not make the mistake of believing that these events are &lt;strong&gt;unprecedented&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite example of this is the invention of the Printing press by Gutenberg in the mid-15th
century (1446-1450). Between the late 15th Century and the late 16th Century, book prices went down
90%: In about 2 generations (life expectancy was low), the price of books had become 1/10th in real
terms (i.e. removing the impact of inflation on the prices). Also, recent economic impact studies
have shown that the impact of the printing press on society was larger than that of the personal
computer between 1977 and 2004. The major difference being that the PC’s impact was much faster (40
years as against the 140 years it took the Printing Press to be propagated across the world). I
imagine myself being 15 years old in 1450, when Gutenberg made his breakthrough. In the next 40
years, book prices would have gone down by nearly half. &lt;strong&gt;That&lt;/strong&gt; sounds very much like an
unprecedented event, but I hesitate to give that tag to anything. Especially when dealing with the
present, one should take special precaution as they have not yet had the luxury to analyze the
events in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other misconception that I have seen thrown around is that the period since the end of WW2 in
1945 has been relatively peaceful. In objective terms, this might have been the case as life
expectancy has gone up and infant mortality has gone down across the world. Rosling makes a
compelling case in his book, Factfulness. But aggregate statistics seldom serve as accurate
reflections of all the people in the world the world (even though they are useful to represent
progress on a timescale longer than 75 years).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold war was not actually “cold” and the post-WW2 period was not peaceful for the people in
Korea, Vietnam or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/proxy-wars-during-cold-war-africa&quot;&gt;Congo&lt;/a&gt;. The US and USSR acted as proxy powers in several countries in Africa, Asia
and the Middle East (CIA orchestrated coups). The type of warfare changed from trench warfare, the
norm during WW1 and WW2, to guerrilla warfare, required to root out the insurgencies of the 20th
century. Nevertheless, the facts remained unchanged for people in the countries that were stuck
fighting a war: &lt;strong&gt;death, displacement and destruction&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the economic front, the 20th Century also saw some major upheaval: Germany was reunified in 1990
after 4 decades of separation. The reunification was followed by a decade of European soul
searching, as various countries in Europe tried to signal their commitment to the bloc; this effort
culminated in the formation of the European Union and the adoption of a common currency in the early
2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s economic policy saw major changes in 1991 and the economy was opened up to foreign
investment and products, the monopolies in the automobile and electronics industries were brought to
an end. The impacts of this policy change have been long reaching. State-owned enterprises that were
created &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; the globalization of the economy (like BSNL) have struggled and continue to face a
government that wishes to privatize these businesses. This indicates another major limitation from
not being able to analyze the event in retrospect: One is unable to properly analyze the &lt;strong&gt;side
effects&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before assigning the dubious distinction of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/unprecedented-named-peoples-choice-2020-word-year-dictionary/story?id=74735664&quot;&gt;unprecedented&lt;/a&gt;” to something, it is worth pausing to
think about whether this take would be valid a year, 5 years, a decade or a century from now. The
telegraph shortened physical distance like never before; the Internet blew the telegraph out of the
water. I am convinced that the sober approach of &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; saying that something is unprecedented is the
way to go when analyzing the present.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My experience with partiality in school sports</title>
   <link href="/2021/01/30/my-experience-with-partiality"/>
   <updated>2021-01-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/01/30/my-experience-with-partiality</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was about 12 years old, I was in school in Mumbai. At the school, I was in the Basketball
team. I started playing the sport without any special reason; it was something to do. As I played
the sport, I discovered that I was particularly good at some of the defensive positions (mainly
because I was able to run faster than everyone else who was at the same school in my age group: an
exceedingly small sample). This discovery was a revelation to me. I believed that the connection
between “skill” and “success” was real: I believed that my coach would see that I had talent and
pick me to play in regional matches. This didn’t happen; in fact, I remember being picked only once
during my 5 years on the team. This is not a &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;sob story&lt;/span&gt;. I wish I &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;did&lt;/span&gt; feel bad about it, I wish I
felt like I had been wronged, so that I could talk about &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;recovering&lt;/span&gt; from that place. I don’t feel
like that at all; I look back at that phase of my life as an amusing few years. This post is an
exploration of my feelings about what happened then and how I make sense of it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my school, there was a pecking order, like in every school and institution out there. In my
basketball team, seniority was everything. The earlier you started practicing with the team, the
better your chances of getting the coach’s attention. There were about 20 people who would attend
most practices and were dedicated to the sport. In any basketball game, 5 people play on the court
at any given time. Frequent substitutions were common for our team, and in actual matches which we
played against other schools from the same city / district / state, the coach decided what
substitutions to make. So, at the top of the pecking order, was the basketball coach, below it were
some of the people who were in the “Under 16 (U-16)” age group and had been practicing for several
years, then there were some of the junior people, like me, who had been a part of the team for only
a couple years at that point, and finally, some people who had just joined the team and would likely
drop out after a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice schedule was relaxed. We practiced for about an hour each day. There were most of the
typical parts of any basketball team’s practice sessions: Lay-ups, running, mock matches,
three-point shoots and free-throw practice. The mock matches were the most exciting. I lived for
those; they gave me the adrenaline rush that I craved: A real match, with a clock and real opponents
(even if they were pretend opponents on your team).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this was great fun. It was the first time I had friendships with people who were older than
me, who had more “life experience” (whatever that means for a 12 year old). I remember one
particular occasion when it was raining heavily and I had gone to practice, arriving completely
drenched, only to learn that practice had been canceled. I don’t know why this particular instance
stuck with me, perhaps because of my belief that I was a diligent member of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of it was not so much fun: I was lightly bullied by some of the older people on the team who
were not very good but had stuck on simply because of their seniority and dedication. I had a few
run-ins with some of the other “favored” players on the team who were good at offense and generally
pissed when I played some part in making them look like a fool on the court. The adult supervision
was limited and I was tiny (about 150 cms, 40 kgs). I remember only a couple instances when the
altercation became physical. I wasn’t &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;damaged&lt;/span&gt; in any sense due to all of this. I am certainly
proud that I didn’t give in to the bullies and continued to play the best that I could on the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember distinctly the coach’s &lt;strong&gt;partiality&lt;/strong&gt; when picking people to play in actual matches. It was
the first time I had run into anything of this sort. I was good at studies and that generally meant
favorable attention from my teachers, and consequently, favorable outcomes when there were
selections for things like the regional Mathematics Olympiad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My run-ins with partiality were &lt;strong&gt;frustrating&lt;/strong&gt; and I felt &lt;strong&gt;helpless&lt;/strong&gt;. Several years later, I still
remember this feeling well: Being &lt;strong&gt;convinced&lt;/strong&gt; that the coach was making the wrong move when he
picked someone to play, certain that I could do a better job. When we went to other schools to play
in regional matches, the coach would &lt;strong&gt;pick the same people over-and-over&lt;/strong&gt;, irrespective of how
dismal their performance in the previous week/day/match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This behavior was inexplicable; maybe he was just incompetent; maybe he chose the same people
over-and-over because he believed that they gave him the best chance at winning; or maybe, he was in
denial, convinced that his judgment was flawless despite all evidence to the contrary. At school, we
called this kind of bias &lt;strong&gt;partiality&lt;/strong&gt;. I have heard about similar experiences from most of my
friends who went to school in India. I hear about this from my younger cousins who are in school
now. We would talk about partiality when people were selected to be a part of the school’s quiz
team, or to go to another city to participate in a debate. This list is endless. When I asked my
parents why this kind of thing happened, they would tell me about the oft-repeated tenet: &lt;strong&gt;Life
isn’t fair; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnlPtaPxXfc&quot;&gt;that’s life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I accepted this principle, and embraced it, without knowing how to deal
with the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t win many matches. The one time that I played in an actual match, I must have been on the
court for about 10 minutes of the total 40 minutes, I don’t remember accomplishing anything
match-changing. We lost that one too. Two things stood out, about this particular loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I &lt;strong&gt;wasn’t jubilant&lt;/strong&gt; that I had been picked to play; I didn’t even tell my parents that I had
been on the court, it felt like a trivial detail.(My parents suspected that I rarely got
picked. They were content to know that I had had a good trip and didn’t press me for details. I am
eternally grateful to them for that. I don’t think it would have done me any good if I had provided
them the details, or if they had tried to console me, or asked the coach to pick me more often).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, that loss didn’t hit me any harder than the ones that I had watched from the
sidelines. Every loss felt the same &lt;strong&gt;irrespective of whether I had been on the court&lt;/strong&gt;. I was not
able to write off the other losses as something I didn’t have much to do with, nor did I feel more
responsible for the loss, when I was the one on the court. It was always a strange experience to get
back on the bus and travel back to our school. Everyone was mostly sad about the match, but we were
also happy about getting to go somewhere, experience the world &lt;strong&gt;alone&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;almost&lt;/span&gt; like
adults (Turns out Michael Scott was right about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tvfanatic.com/quotes/i-guess-this-is-what-they-call-a-bittersweet-moment-it-is-bitte/&quot;&gt;bittersweet experiences&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This visceral experience with bias at a young age jaded me, I think. I found it easier to shrug off
future losses and failures as just unfortunate strokes of luck. Today, looking back, I can see that
I forged the path to where I am. I also like to think that I have tried my best to prevent and be
aware of bias in my dealings with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; I am writing about this after about a decade and if any of the “romanticizing the past
instinctively” business is true, then the “good” parts that I talked about were decidedly worse than
I portrayed them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What's Great about Newsroom, the TV show?</title>
   <link href="/2021/01/23/whats-great-about-newsroom"/>
   <updated>2021-01-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/01/23/whats-great-about-newsroom</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;3 months ago, I had &lt;strong&gt;absolutely&lt;/strong&gt; no idea that people found Sorkin’s writing annoying. Then, I heard
that someone I knew had given up on watching Newsroom after watching the first few minutes of the
Pilot episode. Hearing about that sent me for a brief whirl while I figured out what I liked about
Sorkin and why. I &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt; now I have a better understanding of that. I recently re-watched Sorkin’s
Newsroom. Watching it again after a few years since the last time I watched it, I noticed that I was
familiar with a lot more people in the show (BJ Novak from The Office, Clea DuVall and Sarah
Sutherland from Veep). I also realized that the show is packed with information, nuance and
characters who &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; what they are talking about. &lt;strong&gt;Why can you only either “love” the show or
“dislike” it passionately?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have talked about Newsroom endlessly. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/in-defense-of-aaron-sorkins-the-newsroom&quot;&gt;positive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/06/25/broken-news&quot;&gt;negative&lt;/a&gt; review of the TV show in The
New Yorker cover all the bases. They are both talking about the same components of the show: the
characters speaking articulately, with absolute confidence in what they are saying; each character
being good at what they do and Sorkin’s ability to show the audience that this is how the system is
&lt;strong&gt;supposed&lt;/strong&gt; to work. The critics who don’t like the show find it unrealistic, annoying and
heavy-handed. Let’s look at each of those adjectives in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, let us do away with the “This is not how real people talk” critique. Sorkin is not going
for realism; all of his work has been about people speaking in ways that are dramatized, that appear
real but are very far from reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I dismiss this critique out of hand is that I don’t believe TV shows or movies need to
show reality as is. The shows and movies I like don’t reflect reality at all: Contagion (2011) was
about a pandemic that ended abruptly with a vaccine; The Office (US) is a show about an office that
continues to survive despite the disastrous decision making that goes on inside it; Veep (HBO) is
about an incompetent vice president and her incompetent team reaching the highest levels of
government; Homeland is about a CIA agent who engages in espionage and commits a series of
increasingly questionable actions in pursuit of her goal. These shows &lt;strong&gt;do not aim to portray
reality&lt;/strong&gt; at all. In my mind, the demarcation is clear: Documentaries are about reality, TV shows and
movies are &lt;strong&gt;dramatized versions of reality&lt;/strong&gt; or an interpretation of what an “ideal” or “comically
untenable” version of reality would look like. If the critics who are negative about Newsroom are
doing it because it’s not “real” enough, how would they rate any of these other shows? How would
they critique anything other than a documentary and fantasy? &lt;strong&gt;Here’s my question:&lt;/strong&gt; Is a TV show’s
portrayal of events and their closeness to reality important to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the critics who say that this kind of writing is &lt;strong&gt;“annoying”&lt;/strong&gt;? I believe I understand the
reason that people find it annoying. One of the supporting characters on Newsroom, Sloan Sabbith
(played by Lisa Munn) is a great example of a character that people find annoying. She is an
extremely well-educated economist with a Post Doctorate, who has a ton of experience and knows
exactly what she’s talking about every single time she talks about anything technical. She’s also
“likable” (in a sense) because she is socially inept, aloof and talks about not having a lot of
female friends. In a lot of her scenes, she is talking about a journalistic ideal or an economic
principle. Her explanations are simplified and reductive, but they get the point across. She talks
about Glass-Steagall, the Japanese radiation level announcements in March 2011, the subprime
mortgage crisis that brought about the 2008 meltdown, finding out more about a deal she knows is
happening soon and is intrigued by but doesn’t know the details about, and about her new “Bloomberg
Terminal”, which she uses to figure out which network a potential buyer is going to buy. In all
these scenes, her dialogue is dense, articulate, and filled with important information. There’s &lt;strong&gt;no
filler&lt;/strong&gt;, she doesn’t ruminate or explore what she is about to say before coming to a
conclusion. She’s there and &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;impatiently&lt;/span&gt; waiting for the listener (and the viewer) to catch up. I
find this kind of story-telling challenging and engaging. This is the major reason that I like
Sorkin: He turns TV, a traditionally “passive” medium, into an “active” one by forcing the viewer to
keep up or risk missing the nuance in each sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have thought about the “active” vs. “passive” medium dichotomy for a while now. After a full day
at work, I rarely used to want to read or write anything. Lately, I have been pushing myself to read
and write after work and reduce the amount of time I spend watching TV shows. This is because I want
to ensure that I am spending a big chunk of my time with active mediums, mediums that require me to
think and stay engaged, rather than passive mediums, like TV shows or online videos, which I can
turn on, tune out and let my mind wander aimlessly. Admittedly, passive media is great in some cases
(e.g. plane rides). On a daily basis though, passive mediums are best avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, what about the critics who say that this kind of writing / story telling / TV show making
is &lt;strong&gt;“heavy-handed”&lt;/strong&gt;? There are several ways of making this point; one of the common tropes is to say
that Sorkin’s characters are not the “Average Joe”. They are &lt;strong&gt;incredible&lt;/strong&gt;; they are at the top of
their class, they have had the best education / experience / relationships, they are confident about
who they are and what they want, they are confident that they want to remake the world and they are
sure about how they will do it, they play instruments / are talented / good with people / put other
people at ease. Another common method used to reach the same endpoint is to say that Sorkin
fetishizes intelligence: His characters are intelligent, way more than a “common” person; they have
the capability to take in a huge amount of information, such as books or dense reports with 1000s of
pages and retain almost all their life’s memories, remembering everything that happened several
years ago in great detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there’s no doubt that Sorkin &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; this: another supporting character on the Newsroom, Jim
Harper (played by John Gallagher, Jr.) is good at his job, freaky good. He has spent time with the
US Army as a part of his reporting, he is very good at being Mackenzie’s senior producer in the
studio. His experience is revered and his colleagues hold him in high regard. He plays the guitar,
and is good at getting people to talk to him. He takes stands when he feels like he has to, and
never backs down, ending with the loss of press bus privileges during a campaign and his
relationship. None of this is abrasive to me; in fact, I absolutely &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; to see Jim’s point of
view, not least because I believe that I would agree with him on a lot of things. We see this in
concrete terms when his girlfriend, Hallie, gets a job at a news site called “Carnivore”. Jim
notices that Hallie’s contract mentions that her bonuses are tied to page views on her stories. Jim
believes that this is detrimental to journalism and incentivizes Hallie to write something that
she thinks will get views, rather than something she thinks is important and the public should
know about. Jim’s uprightness about this point is painful, as he lets his relationship with Hallie
deteriorate over an ideological difference. It’s important to point out that even though I agree
with Jim on his point here, I am certain that I wouldn’t let it get in the way that he did. There is
a vicarious living element to relating with characters who don’t back down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the “heavy-handed” approach is a good critique. “The show is insufferable because it’s
filled with characters who know too much and speak too elegantly”? That argument is flimsy to
me. &lt;strong&gt;Exceptional TV shows are not filled with average people&lt;/strong&gt;. Average TV shows are filled with
average people. Seinfeld is not exceptional because the four main characters are run-of-the-mill;
Jon Stewart’s Daily Show was an exceptional piece of comedy television, &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; because Jon Stewart
and the correspondents (Colbert, Helms, Carell, Samantha Bee) were average; Nathan for You is a show
that is filled with average people, seen from Nathan’s point of view, someone who is trying to
figure out the lengths to which people will go, when they are on TV and not really sure about the
show’s goals, a decidedly uncommon thing to think about or try to televise. Expecting great
television that is filled with average characters is a fallacy. The people making these
“intelligent” shows, the characters they are writing, and the actors who are playing these
characters: &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt; of them are average, that is a necessity if they want to continue to make the
kind of TV that they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice? &lt;strong&gt;Watch the show&lt;/strong&gt; and decide for yourself. It is likely that you will like the show. It is
equally likely that you won’t like the show. Once you have made up your mind about which camp you
are in, send the two New Yorker reviews to someone who hasn’t watched the show and ask them to watch
the show.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New Yorker Magazine Subscriptions</title>
   <link href="/2021/01/12/the-new-yorker-subscription"/>
   <updated>2021-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/01/12/the-new-yorker-subscription</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;About 11 months ago, in Feb 2020, I signed up for a 12 week subscription to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;
magazine. It was the first print magazine I came across that supported International shipping and
would ship to Japan. It was also a magazine that I had heard about a lot on TV shows and podcasts
(Seinfeld happens in New York, and in one episode, the main characters discuss a New Yorker cartoon
in depth; This American Life and The Daily are both podcasts that are made by crews that live in New
York) After 24 weeks, I ended up canceling my subscription because I couldn’t keep up with the sheer
volume of content that was being delivered each week. This post is a recap of my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by reading several articles on the website. Most New Yorker articles were available and
they were good; they were articles about a specific issue or a book or someone’s experience which
was pointed, had a fixed story arc and had a clear beginning, middle and end. I liked this kind of
writing and I was ready to spend more time reading it (back then, I was still using Twitter
regularly). The magazine’s subscription had an ongoing sale plan and I would have been able to get
12 weeks of magazines for about $12, which felt like a steal and I bought the subscription. My main
concern when I bought the subscription was that it would be too much to read and I would simply
never get through it and cancel the subscription after some time because I felt bad about not
reading the magazines. This is exactly what ended up happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-i-signed-up-for-a-subscription&quot;&gt;Why I signed-up for a subscription&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the first 4-6 weeks, from Feb 2020 to the end of Mar 2020, I was barely keeping up. I was
spending about 2-3 hours on both days of the Weekend reading the magazine. I came across some great
articles and it was a pretty soothing experience to be able to read something that was not closely
connected to current affairs or news or anything that was happening &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt;. The magazine’s
coverage was also very wide, and I got a kick out of reading the “Around Town” section which
had short snippets about live concerts, Broadway shows, other events happening in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in Tokyo and for the first time, I felt that all the talk about New York being the cultural
center for theater and jazz was not just talk. For the first time during my time here, I questioned
my belief that culture could not be geographically contained. After moving to Tokyo, I had gone to
several rock shows and classical music concerts and piano recitals, for the first time in my
life. They had all been amazing experiences; but I did not kid myself. I knew that Jeff Daniels was
not going to star in an Aaron Sorkin production of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/theatre/to-kill-a-mockingbird&quot;&gt;To Kill A Mockingbird&lt;/a&gt; that would be performed in
Japan. The audience was not big enough; the content was not related enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magazine also had a delightful fiction section and several book reviews, a TV show and movie
review which lead me to some great books and movies. The final part of the magazine were the long
form articles. These were generally on some solid topic which was not related to anything that was
going on at that particular moment of time. It was just a topic that came out of nowhere. These also
often included “Profiles” of people; these profiles were very interesting. I picked up &lt;a href=&quot;file:///book-review/overrated/2020/04/12/sapiens-review/&quot;&gt;Sapiens
(Harari)&lt;/a&gt; after reading the author’s profile (albeit I didn’t end up liking the book).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the cartoons. Oh, a lot has been said about New Yorker cartoons. They are witty and
involved and about 3 times out of 10 they went over my head because I didn’t understand the
reference. I felt pretty-much like Elaine in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cartoon&quot;&gt;The Cartoon (Seinfeld, 1998)&lt;/a&gt;. Apart from the single
panel cartoons, there were also some elaborate drawings in the “Sketchpad” section and these were my
favorite part of the magazine. (Personal favorites: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/30/hammurabis-code-of-manners&quot;&gt;Hammurabi’s Code of Manners&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/20/a-psychiatrist-and-an-artist-walk-into-a-new-york-bar&quot;&gt;A Psychiatrist
and an Artist Walk Into a New York Bar&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-i-canceled-my-subscription&quot;&gt;Why I canceled my subscription&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t keep up with the sheer amount of content in the magazine. There are 46 issues every
year. Every issue is packed with a lot of amazing articles that I didn’t want to miss: This made
skipping over articles or saving them for later hard, I knew that once I moved on from one
particular issue the probability that I would come back to read an article in that issue was very
small. (For me, somewhere around 0.001)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from this magazine, I was reading non-fiction in English and I was also reading several
Japanese news articles every day to get better at the language. I was not going to give up my
non-fiction reading or my Japanese learning to stick with the magazine; the point of reading the
magazine for me was to have something to read during the times that I didn’t want to read the news
or a blog or something technical: &lt;strong&gt;Something to read, instead of watching a TV show or YouTube&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several months later, I do believe this was the right decision. I have ramped-up both non-fiction
reading and Japanese learning in the time since. I &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; feel like I might have been able to work
something out if I had been a little bit more motivated to read and engage with the magazine in a
different, gentler manner; but I don’t know if that’s true or if I am simply idealizing my desire to
read a magazine and not giving up on something that will always remain a pipe dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, as I started thinking about this again, I searched `how do people have time to read the
new yorker` and came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://justincolletti.com/2012/03/21/you-dont-have-to-read-every-article-in-the-new-yorker-or-anywhere-else/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If anything, an article in the New Yorker is more like a pipe or a cigar. It’s consumed, not with
the fidgety and neurotic posture of an insatiable itch-scratcher, but with the deliberate focus of a
Tibetan monk. And unlike smoke, these are stories that last. … I’m glad I didn’t miss it, but I’m
still able to rest easy — even though I’m certain I’ve missed countless stories that are just as
good.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the end, I figure it’s a good thing we don’t all know the same stories, anyway. If we did, what
would there be to talk about when we finally met?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have pinned the New Yorker’s latest magazine’s digital edition on my home computer’s
browser. I plan to start by reading the Fiction section and some of the long form articles that I am
interested in. Eventually, I want to read some of the articles that I am not really interested in to
see if they involve discussion about a topic that I find interesting &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; reading the
article. For the reader of this post, I strongly recommend checking out the Digital edition of the
magazine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Reserve Bank of India's Interventions to maintain excess liquidity - Part 2</title>
   <link href="/2021/01/11/india-central-bank-interventions-goals-2-the-reasoning"/>
   <updated>2021-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/01/11/india-central-bank-interventions-goals-2-the-reasoning</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/economy/india/economic-theory/governments/central-banks/2021/01/11/india-central-bank-intervention-goals-1-the-problem/&quot;&gt;the previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we looked at what the RBI has been doing over the 2020 calendar year. The
over-all effect of RBI’s interventions have been that the exchange rate (INR to USD ratio) has
remained within a narrow window, despite the unprecedented capital inflows into the Indian equity
market. This is by design, and the RBI has tried to explain their policy a few times in various
documents. Although this excess liquidity can theoretically cause high inflation and have an adverse
impact on the currency, a couple other things are happening simultaneously and making this policy
prudent (existing over-valuation and RBI’s strong balance sheet). After reading some of these
documents, here’s my thesis of the advantages and disadvantages of what the RBI has been doing, as I
best understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;advantages&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monetary-policy-transmission&quot;&gt;Monetary Policy Transmission&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of RBI’s goals is to set monetary policy. In an ideal world, they would set a policy with a
given policy goal (e.g. bring down food inflation) and this policy would be transmitted to
end-consumers &lt;strong&gt;perfectly&lt;/strong&gt; through the various economic institutions that sit in between them and the
RBI (e.g. state banks, corporate investors, foreign investors, etc). As you might have guessed, we
don’t live in an ideal world and the RBI has to have a policy to ensure that their monetary policy
is transmitted to end-consumers and has the required effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By maintaining excess liquidity in the system, they are trying to ensure that policy transmission is
close to perfect by maintaining the operating rate (the interest rate at which banks borrow in
reality) close to the policy rate (the interest rate at which banks borrow directly from the
RBI). The high supply of local currency and constant deregulation at the RBI ensures that banks can
borrow at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50946&quot;&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; close to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/WSSView.aspx?Id=24262&quot;&gt;the policy rates&lt;/a&gt;. This can be seen in the release from 8th January 2021:
The short term market repo rate was 3.20%, whereas the policy repo rate for this period was 4.00%,
and the reverse repo policy rate was 3.35%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be a crucial tool during a recession to increase consumer spending and economic activity,
as it has been found to be effective at (say) increasing the amount of real estate loans that are
being issued and helping firms and households start spending again. The RBI has noted this in their
last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in early Dec 2020:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Point 33:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;My own view is that just as the reversal of the liquidity drought had led to a revival of growth
that was visible in the high frequency data for February 2020, the various measures to make
liquidity available through the economy not only helped firms survive but have also revived
demand. The bank credit growth figures show a turnaround but underestimate it. … Real estate
inventory is beginning to move. Both households and firms have deleveraged, are cash rich, and ready
to spend. There are early signs of firms beginning to invest.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50831&quot;&gt;https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50831&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;control-over-valuation-of-the-inr&quot;&gt;Control over-valuation of the INR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When foreign inflows into an economy are high due to a perceived increase in forward earnings, the
risk of over-valuation of the local currency starts going up. This over-valuation adversely impacts
exports (As the local currency appreciates against reserve currencies, foreign buyers will have to
pay more for the same commodity, provided that their local currency is not appreciating as
quickly). To curb over-valuation, the Central bank will purchase the foreign inflows and park them
as Forex reserves on their balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This absorption of the capital inflow by the central bank is also lucrative as it ensures that a
sudden-stop in the capital inflows will not destabilize the market. The central bank can start
removing liquidity from the market gradually, allowing the sudden-stop gradually. In India’s case,
the probability of a sudden-stop is low as 1-year forward earnings are still high, and there are no
big changes in policy or government that are expected until Dec 2021. The next central government
election is only in 2024, a long time away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, here’s an excerpt from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50831&quot;&gt;MPC minutes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The intervention that is raising foreign exchange reserves is required because over-valuation of the
rupee can hurt exports, raise country risk and lead to a sharp depreciation later. Prolonged inflows
can lead to over-valuation without intervention. Surges and sudden stops of capital flows to
emerging markets due to advanced economy quantitative easing have hurt emerging market growth in the
decade after the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;disadvantages&quot;&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RBI has been weighing these disadvantages against the economic growth that is being supported by
the excess liquidity. Ultimately, their decision to stick with their current policy comes down to
their belief that these disadvantages are not devastating even in the worst case and that the risk
is bearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impact-on-consumer-price-index-cpi-inflation&quot;&gt;Impact on Consumer Price Index (CPI) Inflation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excess liquidity’s biggest impact is on CPI inflation: the excess liquidity in the system makes it
easier for firms to invest and they subsequently raise their commodity prices. In some cases, it is
possible to maintain high liquidity but prevent an increase in inflation &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;due&lt;/span&gt; to this. These cases
generally happen when the inflation rates are already quite high and expected to remain high due to
external reasons. As we saw in the previous post, the current high inflation rates in India (October
CPI inflation = 7.6%) are caused by the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on supply chains and some
untimely rains in the harvest season. RBI’s monetary policy is not connected to the current high
inflation rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in these situations, the already-high inflation rates &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;can&lt;/span&gt; be exasperated by the liquidity
surplus. So, the effect on inflation should be closely watched and liquidity suppression tools
should be used when the trend shifts. RBI is on track to do this, although some economists and
analysts believe that RBI’s hand will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/wave-of-foreign-money-threatens-india-s-tight-grip-on-the-rupee&quot;&gt;forced&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 as (say) food inflation starts to go up
again before or during the summer months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Analysts suggest the RBI will be forced to address the [liquidity] glut early in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an excerpt from the MPC minutes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To the extent it is transient the contribution of excess liquidity to cost push inflation is
limited. In an open economy import competition also caps price rise, especially with a rupee that is
tending to appreciate, provided tariffs and taxes are moderated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rbi-keeps-government-borrowing-costs-low&quot;&gt;RBI keeps government borrowing costs low&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the economy is stressed due to various state-wide lockdowns and a sluggish consumer, the
government has been borrowing heavily. The budget deficit for FY2020-21 is now estimated to
end up at about 8%, which is twice the budgeted value of 4%. This deficit is being made up by
government debt issues. A lot of these debt issues have been purchased by the RBI. This has ensured
that the government’s borrowing costs in the long term (i.e. 3-, 5- and 10-year bond yields) have
actually gone down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one facet of the RBI’s theory of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=47983&quot;&gt;Economic Capital Framework&lt;/a&gt;. This theory enhances the
central bank’s role from simply avoiding financial volatility, to being a backstop when the
government’s finances are deteriorating. The central bank aims to achieve this goal by maintaining a
strong balance sheet and transferring balance sheet capital surplus (equity above the required rate
and whole of net income) to the central government. (&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I have been reading about this theory
and I am still trying to understand it’s background and where it came from. I might do a series of
posts about this in the future.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;short-term-rates-crash&quot;&gt;Short-term rates crash&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/wave-of-foreign-money-threatens-india-s-tight-grip-on-the-rupee&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; makes an interesting claim:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lower shorter rates without a similar drop in long-term borrowing costs means a steeper yield curve,
which tends to undermine efforts to stoke growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also discussed vaguely in the MPC minutes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Point 40.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As long as the MPC stance is accommodative durable liquidity will be in surplus and short-term rates
will not rise above the reverse repo rate. Rates have fallen below the reverse repo because of the
combination of excess foreign inflows, intervention and reverse repo access limited only to
banks. Even so, excess liquidity is still absorbed. Regulatory exposure norms can help prevent
excess low rates driven short-term borrowing that creates risks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Point 46.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I believed then and believe now that this reduction of rates carries significant risks and very
little rewards. The rewards are low because long rates are what are relevant for stimulating
investments and supporting an economic recovery; a steepening of the yield curve by a reduction in
short rates does not accomplish this. Also, a reduction in long rates that stimulates investment not
only increases demand in the short run, but it also stimulates supply in the medium term as the new
capacity becomes operational, and this new supply dampens inflationary pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know whether this short-term interest rate crash can have long-term impacts. It looks like
the Monetary policy committee is divided on this point and while the decrease in short term rates is
not being supported by any of the members and is being opposed by some members, they don’t feel that
the risk has risen to a level where they have to act and intervene to support this rate.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Reserve Bank of India's Interventions to maintain excess liquidity - Part 1</title>
   <link href="/2021/01/11/india-central-bank-intervention-goals-1-the-problem"/>
   <updated>2021-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/01/11/india-central-bank-intervention-goals-1-the-problem</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In December 2020, I came across several articles about India’s Central Bank, the Reserve Bank of
India, intervening in the open market to maintain excess liquidity of the Indian Rupee in the
market. With my elementary understanding of currencies, I understood that this excess liquidity of
INR in the market, would keep the currency weak against other currencies, and this seemed
undesirable. In this post and &lt;a href=&quot;/central-banks/economic-theory/economy/governments/india/2021/01/11/india-central-bank-interventions-goals-2-the-reasoning/&quot;&gt;the next one&lt;/a&gt;, I will delve into the complicated reasoning behind the
RBI’s choices and their delicate balancing act which seems to be associated with a high but
manageable amount of risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;premise&quot;&gt;Premise&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, I came across several articles that were talking about the same kind of topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;RBI’s growing policy woes and their potential lose of control of the INR (Indian Rupee)
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/rupee-bonds-joining-stocks-rally-may-add-to-india-s-policy-woes/ar-BB1c9DeE&quot;&gt;msn.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/wave-of-foreign-money-threatens-india-s-tight-grip-on-the-rupee&quot;&gt;bloomberg.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;INR’s momentary appreciation, after the addition of India to a Currency manipulators watchlist by
the US, which lead the RBI to reduce it’s aggressive buying (&lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupee-hits-over-5-month-053059368.html&quot;&gt;finance.yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These topics are all closely connected to each other. In fact, they are all so closely connected
that reading these articles a couple times left me very confused about what was going on, what the
RBI was doing and why the RBI was intervening into a market that wanted to increase the value of the
INR. I will cover the first two points in this post; and a future post will cover the last one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-going-on-before-rbi-interventions&quot;&gt;What’s going on? (before RBI interventions)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few inter-connected things that are happening simultaneously. (This is a subset of all
the things that are happening in the economy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;significant-drop-in-the-inflation-adjusted-10-year-indian-government-bond-yields&quot;&gt;Significant drop in the Inflation-adjusted 10-year Indian Government bond yields&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the 9-month period from Jan-Sep 2020, outflows from the bond markets totaled up to $14bn. In
comparison, the investment in China’s bond market amounted to about $120bn. This exodus could be fueled by
the low levels of inflation-adjusted bond yields: The bond yield hovers around 6%, whereas
the inflation number is hovering around 6.8% to 7.6%. While this inflation-adjusted number might not
deter domestic investors, for foreign investors, this negative inflation-adjusted bond yield
number makes it hard to justify investment in the Indian bond market. Although, it looks like
the outlook for 2021 is optimistic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We are constructive on the Indian market next year as India is a high beta market in EM,” said
Emily Alejos, chief investment officer at Cartica Management in Washington D.C. “We expect all EM to
prosper.”
– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/rupee-bonds-joining-stocks-rally-may-add-to-india-s-policy-woes/ar-BB1c9DeE&quot;&gt;msn.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to look forward to is the inclusion of the Indian 10-year benchmark bond in global
indexes, which will automatically bring inflows through Index funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;huge-capital-inflows-into-the-indian-equities-market&quot;&gt;Huge capital inflows into the Indian equities market&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip-side, capital has flown into the Indian equities market. For the past, this can be seen
in the increase of the main index, the NIFTY50 which &lt;a href=&quot;https://yhoo.it/3sdB3U0&quot;&gt;went from&lt;/a&gt; 12,182 points to 13,981 points, an
increase of 14.76%. One-year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fowardlookingearnings.asp&quot;&gt;forward earnings&lt;/a&gt; are about 28 times according to the msn.com article,
and this has pushed cumulative Foreign buying of Indian equities to about $20bn, from 1st Jan to
15th Dec 2020. This is the highest since 2012 and has caused an unprecedented build-up of USD with
state banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outlook for this continues to be very strong with most analysts expecting this rally in the
investment into Indian equities to hold atleast until Dec 2021. The Indian economy’s recovery has
been sluggish so far, but with the widespread inoculation of vaccines and a reboot of economic
activity and engagement to 90+% of pre-Covid levels, foreign investment might even go up further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(As we will see in the second post of this series, this increase in foreign inflows causes a risk of
“Over-valuation” of the rupee and RBI has been fighting back using aggresive USD purchases)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;supply-side-shocks-raising-all-inflation-numbers-caused-by-covid-19&quot;&gt;Supply-side shocks raising all Inflation numbers (caused by COVID-19)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the COVID-19 pandemic started spreading in India, the government acted swiftly (to a fault and
perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;https://theprint.in/opinion/lockdown-or-not-covid-19-raises-key-questions-on-decision-making-in-a-democracy-like-india/391725/&quot;&gt;prematurely&lt;/a&gt;) and imposed a nationwide lockdown. This lead to a breakdown of most supply
chains as long-distance trains stopped operations and all state borders were effectively
closed. There was a push to ensure that the supply of essential goods and truckers would remain
unaffected, but this didn’t work well enough and the bureaucratic system to grant permits to
truckers most probably took more time than the government initially anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sudden supply-side shock had an expected impact on the CPI Inflation across the country. Food
inflation started &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/india-economy-inflation-idINKBN27T20U?edition-redirect=in&quot;&gt;shooting up&lt;/a&gt; from April, but the expectation of a good harvest kept fears low
initially. As October rolled around, untimely rains in Maharashtra (a major farming state) lead to
the food inflation going up to 11.07%, an all-time high for this number. Overall inflation also kept
going up, and ended up at around 7.6% by early December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key finding here is that this inflation is &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; connected to any of RBI’s monetary policies. In
fact, according RBI’s assessment, they confidently claim that the effect of their currency
interventions on inflation have been minimal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Statement by Dr. Ashima Goyal&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Point 43:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To the extent it is transient the contribution of excess liquidity to cost push inflation is
limited. In an open economy import competition also caps price rise, especially with a rupee that is
tending to appreciate, provided tariffs and taxes are moderated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50831&quot;&gt;https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50831&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; For this series, I will take the RBI Monetary Policy Committee members at face value. In
this regard, healthy skepticism is appropriate, and I will write more about this if I go out to find
something critical about the RBI’s monetary policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rupees-weak-recovery-from-the-initial-recession-caused-by-covid-19&quot;&gt;Rupee’s weak recovery from the initial recession (caused by COVID-19)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, moneycontrol.com and &lt;a href=&quot;https://yhoo.it/3nD5Ia4&quot;&gt;the INR/USD spot rate chart&lt;/a&gt; both show that the exchange rate was
kept in a tight window up to July; the INR/USD ratio stayed above 74.7 from 20th Mar to 21st
Aug 2020. The currency’s appreciation was allowed for a short period of 10 days from 21st Aug to
31st Aug, when it dipped to 73.12. After this short hiatus, the RBI restarted it’s intervention to
support the INR/USD ratio at or above 73.5, and not allowing the INR to appreciate below this
number (&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; A decrease in the INR/USD ratio is considered an INR appreciation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all Asian currencies, INR’s initial depreciation was the highest. After September, INR’s
appreciation was the smallest as shown in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2020/07/Rupee-IFA.png&quot;&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt;. One should note that the prevention of
appreciation of the INR after Sept, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the prevention of momentary depreciation after some &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2020/07/06/china-pulls-back-troops-from-india-border-after-skirmish/&quot;&gt;border
skirmishes&lt;/a&gt; were both direct results of RBI’s intervention. This intervention was egregious enough to
get India added back to a Currency manipulation watch-list by the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(As India waits to be added to global bond indexes, one of RBI’s goal seems to have been to curtail
volatility in the exchange rate by keeping it within a tight window. India’s bonds have not been
included in global indexes mainly due to an overly restrictive regulatory framework, which has not
been modernized quickly enough)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-the-rbi-up-to&quot;&gt;What is the RBI up-to?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph of the RBI’s foreign exchange reserves tells the whole story. IT shows the foreign
exchange reserves going up from $450bn at the beginning of 2020 to almost $580bn at the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/rbi-foreign-exchange-reserves.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual numbers can also be found in the RBI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_viewWss.aspx&quot;&gt;Weekly Statistical Supplement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidenote:&lt;/strong&gt; This page on the RBI website has become my favorite page to get macro information about
RBI’s activities. RBI also maintains &lt;a href=&quot;https://dbie.rbi.org.in/DBIE/dbie.rbi?site=publications&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, the Database on Indian Economy, but I have not been able
to figure out how to download an spreadsheet of time series data or use the native “Filter” feature
yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Value is the amount of Foreign exchange reserves held by RBI in millions of US$)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 26% increase in reserves from the previous year is stunning. This has also pushed RBI to the
fifth place in the list of central banks with the largest reserves of USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This purchase of USD, offsets the increase in the capital inflows. The inflows into the Indian
equity market were $20bn, whereas RBI has purchased nearly $113bn in USD in the same amount of
time. This asymmetric intervention has helped them flood the market with excess INR liquidity and
effectively prevent the INR from appreciating against the dollar. It was only after RBI was added
back to a currency manipulators watchlist did the INR appreciate in real terms.  This appreciation
was short-lived and the RBI got right back into USD purchases. They continue to make weekly
purchases and increase their reserve foreign exchange reserves. Why is the RBI involved in
preventing the appreciation of the Indian Rupee? I will try to present a few advantages and
disadvantages of the RBI strategy in the next blog post (to be released tomorrow, 2021-01-11).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Comparison of metrics of COVID-19 vaccines</title>

   <updated>2021-01-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/01/09/covid19-vaccines-findings-comparisons</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the past few days, several countries have approved vaccine candidates for emergency use and
even wider use. In the US and in India, 2 vaccines have been approved. In the UK, both vaccines that
were approved in the US have been approved, along with one that has been approved in India (under a
different brand name). After seeing all these approvals, I wanted to understand what their
comparative merits and demerits were. In particular, I wanted to understand the size of their
clinical trials, the confidence each had in their efficacy numbers and their safety profiles. To
this end, I read the “Primary results” research papers for all 4 vaccines. This post will try to
compare the headline numbers, and explain some of the similarities between the trials, and the
things that seem to have happened only with a single vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side note:&lt;/strong&gt; These papers were clearly written with very little medical terminology. I was able to
understand them once I knew what terms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion&quot;&gt;Seroconversion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity&quot;&gt;Immunogenicity&lt;/a&gt; meant. The papers do
have a considerable amount of graphs and numbers, so parsing them is an important part of reading
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick comparison table of the efficacy numbers, along with their 95% confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From just these numbers, it is abundantly clear that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are way ahead
of the rest of the vaccines in this pack. The timing of the approvals in India is also worth noting:
Both the approvals came days after the approval in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another astonishing fact is that the Bharat Biotech vaccine which has been approved by the regulator
in India does not have a valid efficacy number yet because their Phase 3 clinical trial is &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04641481&quot;&gt;still
ongoing&lt;/a&gt;, and not &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; the Interim results from those trials have been released. The regulator has
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/oxford-covid-19-vaccine-bharat-biotechs-covaxin-get-final-approval-by-drug-regulator-will-be-indias-first-vaccines-2347053&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that it is a safe vaccine, even though the largest trial for that vaccine has been the phase
2 trial which had 380 participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;astra-zenecas-clinical-trial&quot;&gt;Astra-Zeneca’s Clinical Trial&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was reading the paper with the interim results for the AstraZeneca, I noticed that it was
markedly different from the other papers in some major aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inaccurate-measurement-leads-to-the-creation-of-2-sub-groups&quot;&gt;Inaccurate measurement leads to the creation of 2 sub-groups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the trial COV0002 that was held in UK, there seems to have been some lapse between the
manufacturing of the vaccine and it’s quality check. Here’s the relevant part of the paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Initial dosing in COV002 was with a batch manufactured at a contract manufacturing organisation
using chromatographic purification. During quality control of this second batch, differences were
observed between the quantification methods (spectrophotometry and quantitative PCR [qPCR])
prioritised by different manufacturing sites. In consultation with the national regulator (Medicines
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency), we selected a dose of 5 × 1010 viral particles by
spectrophotometer (2·2 × 1010 viral particles by qPCR), in order to be consistent with the use of
spectrophotometry in the phase 1 study (COV001), 5 and to ensure the dose was within a safe and
immunogenic range according to measurements by both methods. A lower-than-anticipated reactogenicity
profile was noted in the trial, and unexpected interference of an excipient with the
spectrophotometry assay was identified. After review and approval by the regulator, it was concluded
that the qPCR (low-dose) reading was more accurate and further doses were adjusted to the standard
dose (5 × 1010 viral particles) using a qPCR assay. The protocol was amended on June 5, 2020,
resulting in enrolment of two distinct groups with different dosing regimens with no pause in
enrollment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This inadvertent creation of a new sub-group in the test, with an already small size of 3744 people
lead to the reduction of the people who got the “2 Standard Doses” regiment to 2377. The remaining
1367 people were the ones who were included in the “Lower Dose/Standard Dose (LD/SD)” regiment and
the only thing that was required to become a part of the group was that you would have had to arrive
at the trial site between 31st May 2020 and 10th Jun 2020. The careful composition of the original
trial group was affected due to this sub-group, and the observed higher efficacy within this group
(90% in LD/SD against 60.3% in SD/SD) could be a consequence of this lack of proper composition of
the subgroup. The authors say that although this number isn’t conclusive by itself, it’s presence
indicates that conducting a new trial with a smaller primer dose (the first dose) will be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pooling-of-data-across-3-countries&quot;&gt;Pooling of data across 3 countries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca’s phase 3 Interim results are actually the results of 4 trials that are being conducted
simultaneously. Of the 4 trials, 2 are happening in the UK, 1 in Brazil and 1 in South Africa. The
size of each of the trials is small and ranges from 1077 (COV1 in UK) to 3744 (COV2 in UK). Of these
4, only 2 had enough cases to reach the Interim results announcement stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wide-confidence-intervals&quot;&gt;Wide confidence intervals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps one thing that one should take note of. The lower bound of the confidence interval
for efficacy is 41%. While there’s no telling what the actual efficacy is, this wide confidence
interval raises some questions about the size of the trial, and whether the size should have been
bigger to ensure that the interval was smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author’s also note this about the 90% efficacy that is seen in the LD/SD subgroup. The CIs for
this value is 67.4% to 97%, a width of about 29.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Use of a low dose for priming could provide substantially more vaccine for distribution at a time of
constrained supply, and these data imply that this would not compromise protection. While a vaccine
that could prevent COVID-19 would have a substantial public health benefit, prevention of
asymptomatic infection could reduce viral transmission and protect those with underlying health
conditions who do not respond to vaccination, those who cannot be vaccinated for health reasons, and
those who will not or cannot access a vaccine, providing wider benefit for society. However, the
wide CIs around our estimates show that further data are needed to confirm these preliminary
findings, which will be done in future analyses of the data accruing in these ongoing trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;vaccine-safety&quot;&gt;Vaccine safety&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The safety of each vaccine was also a major endpoint in all these studies and they had several
categories of adverse events. Directly related to the vaccine, the adverse events were categorized
as “Local” and “Systemic”, and these were solicited for 7 days after the first and second
injection. The thing to look for here is a higher incidence of local and systemic adverse events in
the participants who are in the Vaccine group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from this, throughout the study, the trial participants were supposed to report adverse events
and severe adverse events to the trial conductor. Here, the thing to look for is similar incidence
of serious adverse events in both the vaccine and the control groups. (These included things like
death by homicide in the AstraZeneca trial or death by suicide or cardiac arrest in the Moderna
trial; they are used to record the adverse events that happen during the trial but are not related
to the vaccine or the trial’s characteristics)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that 2 things happened in all three phase 3 trials:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Younger participants (16-55) were more prone to local and systemic adverse events than older
adults (&amp;gt;=55). The most common adverse event was pain at the injection site after the first and
second dose, and these numbers hovered around 5-10% of all the participants. Fortunately, the
resolution time for these adverse events was within 3-4 days in all trials&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vaccines didn’t lead to “enhanced respiratory disease after infection” (Moderna). This was a
concern that was voiced by several scientists and journalists who are familiar with this issue
when the vaccine development was starting. The Moderna paper explained this well:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The mRNA-1273 vaccine did not show evi- dence in the short term of enhanced respiratory disease
after infection, a concern that emerged from animal models used in evaluating some SARS and Middle
East respiratory syndrome (MERS) vaccine constructs. 23-25 A hallmark of enhanced respiratory
disease is a Th2-skewed 12 immune response and eosinophilic pulmonary infiltration on
histopathological examination.  Of note, preclinical testing of mRNA-1273 and other SARS-CoV-2
vaccines in advanced clinical evaluation has shown a Th1-skewed vaccine re- sponse and no pathologic
lung infiltrates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Bharat Biotech vaccine paper also mentions this as one of the points that makes the vaccine
a promising candidate worth investigating and safe enough to move into the phase 3 trial stage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;efficacy-calculation&quot;&gt;Efficacy calculation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the calculation of the actual efficacy percentage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efficacy = 1 - (IRR&lt;sub&gt;vaccine&lt;/sub&gt; / IRR&lt;sub&gt;control&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where IRR&lt;sub&gt;vaccine&lt;/sub&gt; = Confirmed cases in the Vaccine group / Person-years of surveillance
and   IRR&lt;sub&gt;control&lt;/sub&gt; = Confirmed cases in the Control group / Person-years of surveillance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Surveillance” is the amount of time that the trial participants were followed around for, from a
given number of days after the second dose, until the date of the data-lock. This number of days
after the second dose varies depending on the vaccine, and it was 14 days for Moderna and
AstraZeneca, whereas it was only 7 days for the Pfizer vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The efficacy is often calculated as the “primary endpoint” of these clinical trials, and includes
all the participants who tested negative for COVID19 on Day 0 (i.e. the day that they were
randomized and given the first injection). For a participant to be considered negative, they need to
test negative on the Serology test (i.e. Test for antibodies to the virus) and the Virology test
(i.e. Test for the virus, NAAT or RT-PCR). This definition is slightly different in each study, and
the numbers for the complete group, including those who were seropositive at the start of the trial
are also reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these papers are available under OpenAccess from the journal websites. All the papers linked
here are from the Phase 3 clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Unionized Software Engineers - Is the Social Cost spread out disproportionately?</title>

   <updated>2021-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/01/06/unions-and-social-cost</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We&amp;#39;re Alphabet workers. We’ve been organizing for over a year, &amp;amp; we’re finally ready to share why.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This morning, we&amp;#39;re announcing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/AWU?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#AWU&lt;/a&gt;, the first union open to *all* workers at any Alphabet company.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every worker deserves a union—including tech workers.&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/m2Qmjwz32V&quot;&gt;https://t.co/m2Qmjwz32V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alphabet Workers Union (@AlphabetWorkers) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1346050124544233473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.today/2021.01.05-004554/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; announcing a new workers union for all employees working at Alphabet,
Inc., Google’s parent company, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alphabetworkersunion.org/&quot;&gt;Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt;. The union is constituted by about 400
employees, an extremely small percentage of the total workforce of nearly 250,000 people. The union
dues are 1% of total compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We still have discrimination, harassment, &amp;amp; retaliation at Google. Over half our workforce are
TVCs—paid less, w/fewer benefits, for often the exact same work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We deserve meaningful control over the projects we work on &amp;amp; the direction of this company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s where it gets interesting: The union is a &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;minority union&lt;/span&gt;. As the union doesn’t have a
majority of all the employees as members, there is no basis for them to walk up to Alphabet’s
management and demand to negotiate a Union contract. Instead, they are going to use their union as a
more abstract entity that will be used for other purposes. The question that came up when I was
discussing this with a few co-workers was whether the social cost of &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;this particular type of union&lt;/span&gt;
is spread out disproportionately between the employer and the union members?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been reading up about unions after reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/316767.The_Box?ac=1&amp;amp;from_search=true&amp;amp;qid=iD2OdIfVUf&amp;amp;rank=1&quot;&gt;The Box&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; book about the introduction of the
shipping container and how it took over the world. The most fascinating part of the book for me, was
the explanation of the “transition” period: the period when shipping companies, ports, and shipping
users were deciding whether to move from break-bulk shipping to container shipping. Break-bulk
shipping involves the packing and unpacking of material at each intermediate port. These packing,
unpacking, re-packing steps were carried out by dockworkers. These dockworkers were a part of unions
across the world. In some countries, they &lt;strong&gt;embraced&lt;/strong&gt; the shipping container, deciding to improve
their skills and be a part of the crew that would help initiate the transition. In other countries,
dockworkers unions where &lt;strong&gt;opposed&lt;/strong&gt; to the idea and did &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;absolutely everything&lt;/span&gt; they could to ensure
that the shipping container would not be introduced at the port that they were working at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By “absolutely everything”, I mean a set of general strikes, restrictive union agreements, and
increases in wages. One of the most fascinating clauses that one union agreement had was a clause
that each hatch on a ship would have to be manned by a minimum number of people, irrespective of the
actual amount of cargo that will be moved through that hatch. This lead to cases were the minimum
was 16 people, but only 8 people would be working at any given time. To me, this indicated &lt;strong&gt;a broken
system&lt;/strong&gt; that was not ready to adopt new technology. Was my assessment fair? &lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;, it was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizing to collectively bargain is a major part of the reason that a lot of workers have more
leverage over their employers actions. Unions also &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.today/2020.01.02-165305/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/us/politics/joe-biden-immigration.html&quot;&gt;have power&lt;/a&gt; in political elections, which gives
them more attention from policy makers, and enables them to push for their policy preferences. This
system has it’s advantages and can not be dismissed out-of-hand. This post will explore what is
really going on here, look at the issue from a few perspectives, and try to untangle the various
threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;disproportionate-social-cost&quot;&gt;Disproportionate social cost&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From society’s perspective, the negotiation between a union and the employer is a near-zero-sum
game: Union membership has some major costs, mainly, union dues that one must pay constantly, the
possibility of strikes when the union as a whole or the union leadership is unhappy with the work
conditions, and the possibility of loss-of-pay during the strike while union members are paid out a
lower stipend or given rations, using the fund maintained using their union dues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the union is happy, the cost is almost zero for both employee and employer. There is the union
dues cost, which is balanced out by the time that the employer spends to ensure that their policies
are not exploitative and will not anger the union enough to cause a strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the union is unhappy, for a traditional union, the cost is &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;still&lt;/span&gt; evenly spread out: The
company loses their revenue, their ability to fill orders and a major drop in production, which will
affect their yearly output targets. Union members bear an equal cost, as they are essentially out of
a job and must now start managing with a stipend or rations; in some cases, they also need to
physically be at the picket line and spend their time there picketing. Over-all, I would say that
the cost of a traditional union during both conditions is proportionately spread out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50275.Last_Exit_to_Brooklyn&quot;&gt;Selby Jr’s Last Exit To Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; is a novel that captures the mentality of a particularly lethargic
Union member (Harry) from several decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, take the case of the Alphabet Union: They don’t have any contract. But they &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; reserve the
right to not work on projects that they don’t agree with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All aspects of our work should be transparent, including the freedom to decline to work on projects
that don’t align with our values. We need to know the impact of our work, whether it’s on Alphabet
workers, our communities, or the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.vn/YkO6l#selection-628.0-628.3&quot;&gt;Values, Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the costs are no longer proportionately spread out anymore. The employer can’t do
much in this case (certainly not an employer like Google) because these workers are not going on
strike as a majority union. They are simply refusing to work on a particular project. Let’s call
these projects that some people don’t want to work on, “morally disagreeable projects”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a large-scale company like Google, it will be extremely easy to move people around and find
people to work on any project, their pay-scale and the prestige of working at that employer is high
enough to balance out the “moral dilemma” caused by these projects. On the other hand, a
smaller-scale company which wants to get involved in a morally disagreeable project will find it
&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;very hard&lt;/span&gt; to staff that project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, an employer who wants to work on such a project has a few options to move forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Staff the project using people who don’t mind working on it OR&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop working on the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option (1) will always be feasible for large-scale companies; they will certainly work for companies
like Alphabet. Option (2) will be the most obvious option for smaller scale companies. If the
company depends on this project for it’s survival, it might go under. This in-turn will have a
ripple effect, that leads to a “bad rep” (a bad reputation) for places where such projects can not
be undertaken. Leading to newer companies attempting to work on these morally disagreeable projects
&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;either&lt;/span&gt; not coming up at all &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; coming up in a different location and breaking up the Silicon
Valley hegemony on start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, it is quite clear to me that the existing smaller-scale companies and future start-ups,
in the location where organizing similar to the Alphabet Union becomes popular will bear the brunt
of the burden. This disproportionate burden on one party leads me to believe that there is &lt;strong&gt;a
structural problem&lt;/strong&gt; with the idea of a union where the costs are disproportionately shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;structural-concerns&quot;&gt;Structural-concerns&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, the Alphabet Union is not going to negotiate a Union contract. Instead, they are
going to exist as a body that is going to work on the sidelines. Google’s current rhetoric seems to
be a complete lack of recognition for the union: Employers can insist that they will &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; deal
with employees on an individual basis, as hinted at in this New York Times article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In response, Kara Silverstein, Google’s director of people operations, said: “We’ve always worked
hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our work force. Of course, our employees
have protected labor rights that we support. But as we’ve always done, we’ll continue engaging
directly with all our employees.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Although they will not be able to negotiate a contract, the Alphabet Workers Union can use other
tactics to pressure Google into changing its policies, labor experts said. Minority unions often
turn to public pressure campaigns and lobby legislative or regulatory bodies to influence
employers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.today/2021.01.05-004554/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html&quot;&gt;NYT article announcing the union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lack of a union contract, the benefits for membership are very little. One gains some power
from the fact that this block of employees &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;might&lt;/span&gt; work together to push the employer into some
difficult arguments in the public sphere, but this would be no different from the public pressure
campaigns that employees at several software companies have been running over the past year as
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/facial-recognition-backlash-brews-after-fury-over-police-conduct/ar-BB15ZGVX&quot;&gt;facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/9/20906605/github-ice-contract-immigration-ice-dan-friedman&quot;&gt;software for border control agents&lt;/a&gt; have started becoming hot-button issues
with this group of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, one of the biggest problems that experienced organizers identify and talk about is the
lack of incentive for the highly-skilled, focused-on-work employees to join traditional
unions. These employees tend to have good relationships with their manager, good wages and a
generally good opinion of their employer. They are the hardest to get to join the union, &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; they
are the most important for the union, because in their absence, the union does not have legitimacy
in the employer’s perspective. McAlevey talks about this at length in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2020/3/17/21182149/jane-mcalevey-the-ezra-klein-show-labor-organizing&quot;&gt;her interview on the Ezra
Klein Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that most software engineers work in firms where the difference in skill varies only by
their grade, and rarely has huge variations within peers who are on the same grade. In this
situation, either all the people from a given grade will have an incentive to join the union OR they
will not join the union. My bet is that the membership numbers for the Alphabet Union will stall and
they will not be able to sign-up even 10% of the total Alphabet employee base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the other major structural concern that I came up with was the &lt;strong&gt;difference in the union’s
use-case&lt;/strong&gt;. Traditionally, unions have been used by workers who have been exploited by their
employer. The ability to bargain collectively gives these workers the kind of leverage that they
can’t get if they were to negotiate their work hours or pay with their direct manager in a 1-1. This
technique has been effectively used by factory-floor workers, dockworkers, teachers to get better
pay and better work hours. In all these cases, the underlying issue is related to a concrete Labor
Law issue; this concrete connection makes the reasoning objective. On the other hand, &lt;a href=&quot;#orgc9af6c7&quot;&gt;a morally
disagreeable project&lt;/a&gt;, is ill-defined and completely subjective. The lack of objectivity makes it
very hard for the employer to predict which employees will not work on what projects (HR departments
frown on discussions about political leanings at work, although there is wide variation on this
between companies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;orgc9af6c7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-a-morally-disagreeable-project&quot;&gt;What is a “morally disagreeable project”?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The subjectivity of this definition might be abundantly clear to you. If so, you can skip this
section.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral nature of a project and whether it agreeable to one or not depends on their
political leanings and personal philosophy. This evaluation is bound to vary from one person to the
next, and there is no real “control” group here that can be used as a litmus test to decide whether
something is disagreeable to a majority or not (Elections are the closest we come to implementing
this mechanism, and we often don’t get the result that we want, or even the result that the majority
wants if &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-the-gop-isnt-able-to-win-the-popular-vote/?cid=rrfeaturedvideo&quot;&gt;the system has structural problems&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going further, I argue that one would be able to find &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;an&lt;/span&gt; argument against &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; company that harms
either society or the environment. Several existing arguments can be re-framed as arguments that harm
people or the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Amazon, the impact of 2-day shipping on the environment has been widely studied. This
Vox video condenses a bunch of the research and concepts into a short snippet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5HOijUtExiM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will get tougher for employers to adjudicate whether a given project will be morally disagreeable
to the team that will work on it. The best case result of this is an employer whose limits match
exactly with their employees. The worst case is one where the employer and the employees are on
completely different sides of the spectrum, leading to &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;either&lt;/span&gt; pandering to ensure that attrition
stays low &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; doing what the employer wants to do at the risk of losing talent, due to a belief
that what the employer wants to do is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892354/mark-zuckerberg-full-transcript-leaked-facebook-meetings&quot;&gt;already facing challenges&lt;/a&gt; like this one and as Mark Zuckerberg puts it, “We should
remember that Facebook’s employees are much further to the left compared to Facebook’s users”. As
the employer, Zuckerberg and Facebook, the company &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to focus on their users. &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;But&lt;/span&gt; they are also
caught in a bind with their own employees unwilling to work on a platform that they believe is
empowering the people that they don’t want to empower. Casey Newton and Ezra Klein flesh this out
further on the podcast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/2/28/21153060/social-network-polarization-ezra-klein-why-were-polarized-q-a&quot;&gt;The Interface&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The border line between agreeable and disagreeable is shifting frighteningly fast. The discourse has
moved a long way away from how we were talking about climate change or fossil fuel consumption
reduction or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.vn/fzktX#selection-336.0-336.1&quot;&gt;fossil fuel production&lt;/a&gt; compared to 2010, only 10 years ago. The change over the
next 10 years might not be as dramatic, but there is no way to tell. Organizations that like to have
10 or 20 year plans and “roadmap” slide decks are going to have a nightmarish time figuring out &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;how
much&lt;/span&gt; things will change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the coming months, we will see the saga of the unionized software engineers and other Alphabet
employees play out. We will also see what happens when the moral alignments of an employer and their
employees does not line up perfectly, by looking at the crisis that seems to be brewing inside
Facebook. Both of these are new phenomena that are caused due to a simultaneous increase in the
irreplaceable nature of some employees in these companies and the increase in the scale of these
companies and the incredible variety of people that their products touch.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Strength of the Counter-Argument to Public Advocacy</title>
   <link href="/2021/01/04/weak-counter-argument-to-public-advocacy"/>
   <updated>2021-01-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2021/01/04/weak-counter-argument-to-public-advocacy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Dec 10th 2020, Zeynep Tufekci made &lt;a href=&quot;https://zeynep.substack.com/p/vaccines-and-decision-making-with&quot;&gt;a public argument&lt;/a&gt; for a trial of the single dosage of the
Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines on her mailing list, Insight. When I first read the argument and
it’s basis on the apparent safety and efficacy of just the single dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine, as described in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577&quot;&gt;official peer-reviewed paper&lt;/a&gt;, I agreed with Tufekci. Her argument is a
solid one and poses the central question: &lt;strong&gt;Is vaccinating 95% of 50% of available doses better than
60-80% of the total available doses?&lt;/strong&gt; The answer is equally simple: &lt;strong&gt;No one knows yet&lt;/strong&gt;. Some
inferences can be drawn from the data of the 1300 people who didn’t get the second dose in the
original N = 40,000 clinical trial. But this subset of 1300 people is not as random as the original
well-designed trial. Another clinical trial, the advocacy for it in as many public forums as
possible and subsequent funding / trial design seems like the prudent way to go forward, as Tufekci
describes in her post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Dec 30th 2020, Tufekci posted philosophy professor,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matthewnoahsmith.net/&quot;&gt;Matthew Noah Smith&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://zeynep.substack.com/p/a-counter-argument-against-public&quot;&gt;counter&lt;/a&gt; to her original
argument on Insight. I read that post today and found it to be particularly weak. This post goes on
to explain why I felt that, and the peculiarities in Smith’s post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post intrigued me because I was looking forward to a rousing philosophical debate on the greater
implications of whether public advocacy was really flawed in high-stakes situation. Unfortunately,
the post doesn’t go much beyond this particular case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, the number of available doses hovers around 50 million for the US right now. This
question is already being faced by several other countries (Indeed, the UK has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-chief-medics-justify-single-dose-coronavirus-vaccine-strategy/&quot;&gt;decided to go ahead&lt;/a&gt;
with the single dosage regimen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As can be seen, the incidence of Covid-19 drops off dramatically about 10 days after the first dose
(look at the chart on the top left). However, the trial is designed to measure the efficacy of two
doses: a prime and a booster. Eyeballing (we don’t have the underlying data), the first shot seems
to have 65-80% efficacy in the full group—but we don’t know for how long that lasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might argue accurately that countries scarcely have the time to accommodate philosophical
arguments, that the best thing to do right now is the thing that will reduce short-term and
long-term adverse outcomes. I will table that for the time-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting that aside, here are some things that I couldn’t reconcile within Smith’s argument, that
ultimately lead me to believe that Smith’s argument is weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-cautious-optimismovert-pessimism-fork-in-attitudes&quot;&gt;The cautious optimism/overt pessimism fork in attitudes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes from Smith’s article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is more difficult to weaponize technical language used in academic journals and grant
applications than it is to weaponize exasperated charges of epistemic irresponsibility made in
places like Twitter. For this reason alone, we should restrict calls for single-dose trials to
venues where experts engage other experts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Bad actors with power have regularly harmed marginalized communities in the name of science. This
same pattern of oppression could be reproduced when it comes to vaccine distribution. … The
rhetoric around a single-dose trial could be twisted by people as a pretext for denying second doses
[to] the marginalized. (sic)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This plays into the pernicious pandemic wartime imaginary we’ve all been invited to take up. Doctors
and nurses are “heroes” who have been at the “front lines,” and hospitals are “war zones.” Once we
couple this with the firm conviction among conservatives that the police are a beleaguered identity
group, an easy strategic choice in response to vaccine distribution woes will be to deny poor
communities and communities of color both doses of the vaccine until all those “battling” the virus
receive two doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that the fork in Smith’s argument’s attitudes towards similar groups of people remains
&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;unresolved&lt;/span&gt;: Smith is &lt;strong&gt;very optimistic&lt;/strong&gt; that the conservative media will &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; find an article or
letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) or find it hard to exploit; while
being &lt;strong&gt;extremely pessimistic&lt;/strong&gt; about the outcomes of public advocacy: namely, a coordinated and
racist effort to ensure that police officers and other “front-line” workers will be given a 2-dose
vaccine regimen, at the cost of the poor, homeless, and other vulnerable demographics; all of whom
also have the least access to healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dichotomy is hard to reconcile. The conservative media and the government bureaucrats and
lackeys that Smith is splitting up in his article are both on the same side of the political
spectrum, and &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;ostensibly&lt;/span&gt; very close to each other in terms of both social and economic
policies. Why would one group be particularly restrained about legitimizing single-dose regimens
using a JAMA letter, whereas the other group would use a public version of the same content, to
actively prevent particular people from being vaccinated? One must argue &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;either&lt;/span&gt; that they are all
con-artists who want to find the slightest shred of scientific doubt, and use it to exclude people
&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; that they are restrained, well-intention-ed actors, whose moral threshold for converting
scientific doubt into a strategy, lies somewhere between a New York Times article and a JAMA
letter. Smith seems to be arguing for the former, but this quote is an outlier and doesn’t make it
too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All they need is quasi-scientific cover for unequal spatial distribution of a two-dose vaccine
distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith’s overt, almost militant, pessimism towards the prevention of the second dose for a particular
group of people seems unnecessary and hard to justify: Even if it was just informal policy, any
widespread attempt to deny second vaccine doses will quickly become a big story in the Liberal
media. Moreover, states where the state legislatures are Democrat-controlled do exist (albeit, they
are in the minority). Vaccine efficacy rates in these states will be much higher even when the same
number of doses per-capita have been doled out; scientists and pundits will both be hard-pressed to
find the reason and this (in)formal policy would be the primary suspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;are-technical-articles-harder-to-exploit-for-political-gain&quot;&gt;Are Technical articles harder to exploit for political gain?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While it is impossible to prevent cynical politicians from weaponizing science for short-term gain,
simple precautions should be taken. One tactic is to avoid turning a scientific disagreement into
acrimonious public disagreement. It is more difficult to weaponize technical language used in
academic journals and grant applications than it is to weaponize exasperated charges of epistemic
irresponsibility made in places like Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second peculiarity in the argument is that Smith vehemently believes that it will be
considerably harder to demonize the kernel of scientific doubt, inherent in everything, if that
doubt is expressed in a JAMA letter, whereas it will be far easier to exploit if it was done through
a post on Tufekci’s blog, a New York Times article, and a press conference at Harvard. Considering
that the conservative media is made up of competent institutions which have researchers combing
through public discourse to find chinks in the armor of the 2-dose vaccine regimen’s requirement,
there is no doubt in my mind that they would find the JAMA letter. Given that base assumption, what
makes a JAMA letter harder to exploit? The content would have been the same. Smith says the same
thing, “All they need is quasi-scientific cover for unequal spatial distribution of a two-dose
vaccine distribution.”, although this acceptance doesn’t affect his underlying argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going one step further, I argue that the JAMA letter approach would be detrimental to Tufekci’s
cause, as the journal article would have &lt;strong&gt;far fewer readers&lt;/strong&gt;. It would not enter the organic news
feeds that are consumed by people who don’t get their news from conservative media. They might even
come across the article &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; through coverage of conservative media on other media outlets as a
“Factcheck” or as “Media critic”, which substantially reduces the power of the advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story that deserves to be publicized is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the one that the Conservative media took a JAMA
letter and mis-categorized it. This would invariable be what goes into the feeds watched by Liberal
news consumers. The coverage of the story will become the story, similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/yFsyfXEENPU?t=131&quot;&gt;CNN coverage&lt;/a&gt; of the
Healthcare bill’s repeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, in the quote at the beginning of this section, Smith seems to accept that it’s impossible
to prevent cynicism, and that these would simply be measures that &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;might&lt;/span&gt; work. Weighing the
argument for a single dose trial (which could potentially double the number of vaccinated people)
&lt;strong&gt;against&lt;/strong&gt; the off-chance that cynical politicians and media outlets on the right will be &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;sloppy&lt;/span&gt;
and &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;miss&lt;/span&gt; a JAMA letter, the former’s superiority, in terms of better, wider, positive outcomes, is
clear to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;tufekcis-arguments-coverage-will-mislead-non-medical-observers&quot;&gt;Tufekci’s argument’s coverage will mislead non-medical observers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final qualm with Smith’s argument is his belief that the stories covering the strategy that
Tufekci took will be confusing or misleading, even if they don’t intend to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even though the public message is that we should trial a single-dose vaccine, it is reasonable for
someone unfamiliar with how medical research works to infer from a news story about the proposal
that a single dose would be sufficient for vaccination. Furthermore, it is reasonable for someone
who sees a story on TV about a study of single test efficacy to then describe it to acquaintances as
a story about how only one dose of the vaccine is needed. After all, isn’t it rational for these
non-experts to infer from respected professors aggressively advocating in public for a single-dose
trial that a single dose would be sufficient? Why else would they be so vocal and so insistent on
the urgency of a trial?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The intensity of emotions around these issues does not make trivial, often ersatz, scientific
disagreement less likely to be perverted into a tool to discredit even the most widely accepted
views.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What will happen if rhetoric supporting a single-dose trial is weaponized? It is difficult to
determine. We have some evidence from both this pandemic and the anti-vax movement that non-trivial
portions of the population might, on the basis of the weaponization of public advocacy for a
single-dose trial, reject public health guidelines around vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lies in direct contrast to something that he says just a few paragraphs before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If a trial is warranted, then we ought to have some confidence that a single dose of either vaccine
would be effective. But we also should have sufficiently low confidence that a single dose would be
effective. This is exactly why a trial is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith seems to be saying that non-medical readers will somehow “miss the point”, even in good faith
coverage of Tufekci’s strategy. I don’t think this is true or fair. The problem is not with the
coverage, but with how most people consume the news: in short bites, as web page titles OR the first
2-3 minutes of a YouTube video describing the story. A consumer who reads Tufekci’s article, even
just the first few paragraphs, will &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; come out believing that a single dose is better or
efficient &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;enough&lt;/span&gt;. To her credit, the article on Tufekci’s blog doesn’t even mention her argument
in the title. It is a broader appeal &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; effective policy-making in the absence of sufficient data.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Most Valuable Resource</title>
   <link href="/2020/12/13/most-valuable-resource"/>
   <updated>2020-12-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/12/13/most-valuable-resource</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I started thinking about why I was not spending time writing posts for this blog OR
working on a side project that I have wanted to work on for a while. My conclusion was that I was
not allocating my time properly. This is not original; I didn’t think it was a significant
conclusion at first. As I started working on that, I came across another question that felt like a
pretty good summary of what I was feeling at that point in time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Most Valuable Resource (MVR) in your life right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started thinking about this off-and-on, and I eventually came to the conclusion that right now, it
is &lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;. Thinking back to my childhood or my time in college, and I realized that my MVR in those
stages of life were different from what it is now. In college, it was &lt;strong&gt;Experience&lt;/strong&gt;. In school, it
was &lt;strong&gt;Identity&lt;/strong&gt;. This post is an exploration of my thinking on this subject. It is meant to stimulate
readers to think about what their MVR is, how it has changed over the years, and how they might go
about gaining more of their MVR through conscious changes in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#orgafb9010&quot;&gt;High School: &lt;strong&gt;Identity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#orgb68f332&quot;&gt;College: &lt;strong&gt;Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#org9e5bfc8&quot;&gt;Now: &lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#orgb4a81c4&quot;&gt;Caveats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;orgafb9010&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;high-school-identity&quot;&gt;High School: &lt;strong&gt;Identity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing about finding one’s identity in high school is not very interesting or useful. The
discovering of one’s identity in the world, in relation to all the other kinds of archetypes, is a
major part of one’s life. I think there’s some debate about when exactly one knows who they are and
are able to accept and make peace with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in my preteens, I had my first few experiences of being &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;betrayed&lt;/span&gt; by the people around
me that I had considered to be friends. I don’t remember the actual betrayals or &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;how egregious&lt;/span&gt;
they were anymore. My 13 year old self would vehemently claim that it was an injustice that one
couldn’t simply understand, “It is what you live it”. Around this period, as I was trying to
understand why people did these things, my parents would tell me often, and forcefully, that one
must be ready to deal with people who are unlike anything that one was raised to be. This simple
piece of off-hand advice has proven very useful, as I have read more about the thought process,
conflict, political opinions and persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I moved into high-school, I embraced the &lt;strong&gt;identity&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;a studious, mathematics nerd&lt;/strong&gt;. I
installed Linux Mint on the desktop computer that was in our home, and waited with bated breath for
the progress bar on the screen to reach 100%. I was waiting to find out if I had effectively
prevented my parents from using the computer through the weekend, while I figured out what had gone
wrong, and tried to fix it by reading help web pages on my Dad’s work computer. Or, if I had
successfully installed an OS alongside Windows. My initial installations were dual boot
installations where Mint was installed inside Windows as a simple program. As I gained more
confidence, I started installing, uninstalling and re-installing various Linux distributions in an
effort to somehow get to a “not particularly nerve-wracking” installation experience. I did not
succeed. (These days, I get around this by never removing any installation of Linux, from any
computer that I am using; a rather unappealing cop-out)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initial exposure to Linux built a familiarity with the command line from a fairly young age. I
started using Git with absolutely no understanding of what it was really for back in 2011. None of
these things were particularly big leaps in my search for an Identity, but they all added up to
something very concrete: I was not uncomfortable having interests that others didn’t share, I was
not really worried about &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;conforming&lt;/span&gt;, I was not worried about appearing uninterested in the
“elementary” computer science class, as I corresponded with my CS teacher, via e-mail, trying to
understand how I could use languages other than C, and what she thought would be useful “Next
Steps”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;sub&gt;Editorial&lt;/sub&gt; note:_ Reading this now, I am worried that I thought of myself as too much of a
&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;non-conformist&lt;/span&gt;, when I was absolutely not anything like that. I had good grades throughout all my
school years, and complaints from teachers to parents about me in school were never about not
conforming or question my teachers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This self-identification as a math nerd stuck to me as I moved into the new environment of a
coaching class with younger, more approachable “professors” and a group of extremely motivated peers
who were focused exclusively on understanding the material and performing at the competitive,
university entrance exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going into college, it continued to held sway. In college, I gravitated towards courses in the
Mathematics Department, even though my major was in Mechanical Engineering, a discipline that I
never came around to fully &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;like&lt;/span&gt;. Eventually, I ended 5 years of college with a minor in
Mathematics and Computing, consisting of courses on the Foundations of Cryptography, Modern Algebra
and Graph Theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;sub&gt;Editorial&lt;/sub&gt; note:_ I had to look at my transcript to remember the name of the Algebra course)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this period, I was mostly reading fiction and I don’t remember anything that I came across
that stuck with me for a long time. Looking back, these 2 quotes about studying for examinations and
performing at school and other academic settings seem apt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t try to be at the top of the class. Don’t be at the bottom either. Find the 85% scoring sweet
spot where you know the material well enough that you are spending the least fraction of your time
on mandatory schoolwork. Spend all the remaining time on things that you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--quoteend--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People care about your grades only when they are bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The first quote is from a very famous essay about preparing for exams. I have read this essay a
couple times now, but I can’t find it right now. If I find it later, I will edit this post and put a
link here)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;orgb68f332&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;college-experience&quot;&gt;College: &lt;strong&gt;Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied in Kharagpur, West Bengal in India. Kharagpur is a mid-sized town and is located a 2-hour
drive or a 3-hour train ride away from Kolkata, one of the four major metropolitan cities in
India. Until this point, I had lived in an industrial township near Mumbai and then in Navi Mumbai
proper, so my experience until then was very much of a bustling metro city with a wide variety of
things to do (like going to a movie theater with my friends after school exams).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kharagpur is a great college town. The college’s campus is a physical gated town within a town. One
ventures out more and more often as one gets used to living in the town. In my final 2 years on the
campus, I left the campus to go to the spots around Kharagpur town (restaurants and such) more than the
3 years before that combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this sounds like a good set-up (and it was), I craved &lt;strong&gt;Experience&lt;/strong&gt;. In particular, I craved
the experience of &lt;strong&gt;foreign travel&lt;/strong&gt;. I was hooked to Casey Neistat’s videos about his life as a
traveling Ad film-maker. I left India for the first time a few days after my twenty second birthday,
on a trip to Bali with a friend. This trip was memorable and surprisingly unremarkable. I had
incorrectly believed that my first trip abroad will be set in stone, and end up defining all my
trips after that. This was not the case, and my mind moved along much faster than I had originally
imagined it would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two quotes from this period of time in life that really resonated with me right after I
had achieved my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The greatest things that happen to a human being will happen to you too; you just have to lower your
expectations&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Phil Dunphy (Modern Family) (A fictional character)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--quoteend--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You will get everything that you want in life; but it will take just a little bit longer than you
expect it to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Casey Neistat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org9e5bfc8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;now-time&quot;&gt;Now: &lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have a full-time job as a Software Engineer. I live in a foreign country, I am studying a
foreign language. The resource that has become my MVR is &lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t say “You don’t have time to do X”. You &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;did&lt;/span&gt; have time. You decided to do something other than
X in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed this feeling of reduction of time early this year when I started working from home. My
commute was an hour long, so one of the first immediate consequences I expected was an increase of 2
hours per day in my daily routine. This didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2 months, I realized that this was not happening and I looked closely at my work hours and
found that they had not increased significantly (They had increased slightly compared to before, but
certainly not by 2 hours a day). My sleep patterns were unchanged according to my Fitbit data. I was
sleeping the same amount of time, and I was mostly adhering to a routine that allowed me to get off
of work around 7 pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started focusing in on this block of time after 7 pm. I was going to sleep every day around
midnight, or later. That was a solid 5+ hours that I was using to do something other than read
books, write emails and essays, and cooking or cleaning. The culprit was Netflix and other on-demand
video sites. I found this anecdotally, and quantified it by looking at the amount of texts that I
was sending my friends about new Netflix series that I had started watching. This was a non-issue
when I had a commute as I was tired by the time I got back home and I rarely watched new shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a period of time, I didn’t think this was particularly concerning or noteworthy. I was watching
Netflix voluntarily and I knew that I could break the habit off if I needed to. I had also come
across some really good series like Ozark and Parks and Recreation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started preparing for a proficiency test for Japanese, I started reading Japanese novels. These
books were extremely difficult to read and they often took over 16-20 hours each weekend. For my
first few novels, I spent every waking minute during those weekends that I was not cooking, cleaning
or eating, reading the novel. This was a very rewarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, I started thinking about cutting down on on-demand video through out-of-band solutions
(out-of-band = things other than canceling my Netflix subscription). A solution that I have been
running as a trial for the past 14 days is a “no-browser-after-10pm” policy. Today was the 14th day
of the trial, and I have decided to extend the trial for another 14 days as I have not noticed any
adverse effects from not being able to use a browser (Firefox) for the last few hours of each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;orgb4a81c4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;caveats&quot;&gt;Caveats&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A keen reader may have noticed that I didn’t mention &lt;strong&gt;Money&lt;/strong&gt; as an MVR at any stage in life. This
has been a great stroke of luck, and I have been incredibly fortunate to have not had to consider
&lt;strong&gt;Money&lt;/strong&gt; my MVR at any point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept is something I came up with off-hand, along the lines of the “Most Valuable Product”
(MVP) culture, that is common in some software engineering teams and companies.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; This is the final post in a series of 3 posts about my experience configuring Emacs over 7
months, starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/emacs/editors/tools/configuration/2020/11/15/configuring-emacs-7-months-later-act-1&quot;&gt;Post 1: Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/emacs/editors/tools/configuration/2020/12/01/configuring-emacs-7-months-later-act-3&quot;&gt;Post 3: Writing Emacs Lisp Functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org8af0131&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emacs Lisp is the language that is used to configure Emacs. It is a functional programming language
and looks very similar to the prefix notation that is used when doing simple arithmetic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-elisp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;34&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;4.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;51.94805194805195&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;; Insert the current time string at point in the active buffer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;insert-string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;current-time-string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#org8af0131&quot;&gt;Act 3: Writing Emacs Lisp Functions&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#orgfff7e2f&quot;&gt;Delete all comments from a buffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#orgcfe5ed0&quot;&gt;Copy the contents of the current buffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;orgfff7e2f&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;delete-all-comments-from-a-buffer&quot;&gt;Delete all comments from a buffer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/.emacs.d/commit/e501bb0a&quot;&gt;e501bb0a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal at this point was to write an Emacs function that would delete all the comments from a
file. This goal was a fairly simple one (I thought) because I was using a Regular expression in Vim
to do this: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:g/^#/norm dd&lt;/code&gt;. I used the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; because I deleted all comments only from shell files
which were copies of the commands that I had run (My PS1 starts with a hash to ensure that when I
ran this command, personal information like my host name or the path will be stripped).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late October, 6 months and 9 days after I made my initial commit, I was able to write a function
which actually deleted all comments from a buffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I faced some interesting challenges when I was writing this function. My original goal seemed
extremely simple: Delete a line if it is a comment; run this for the whole buffer. Thinking like an
editor, I decided to do this on a line-by-line basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting challenges was figuring out when I was at the end of a buffer. Emacs does not
seem to have any function to get the last line. There are functions to get the last byte position,
but none to get the last line, that I was able to find. So, I had to manually keep track of whether
I was deleting a line. This lead to a function which would call another function and depending on
whether the line was deleted, subtract one from the original &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;last-line-number&lt;/code&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process was full of other challenges that were related to my inability to find the name of the
function that I wanted to use quickly. Emacs functions are not all named using some common pattern,
which would make them easier to find. For e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;line-number-at-pos&lt;/code&gt; returns the line number at the current position&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(beginning-of-buffer)&lt;/code&gt; moves the cursor to the beginning of the buffer, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(forward-line)&lt;/code&gt; moves
one line ahead&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(kill-whole-line)&lt;/code&gt; deletes the current line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can probably see, there’s no common convention here. All functions that deal with lines
don’t &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;line-&lt;/code&gt;, they simply &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;have&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;line&lt;/code&gt; word in them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;orgcfe5ed0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;copy-the-contents-of-the-current-buffer&quot;&gt;Copy the contents of the current buffer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal for my second function was to copy the contents of the current buffer to the system
clipboard. Writing this function took far less time, and I was able to find the functions I needed
to use fairly easily. It was also much smaller; in fact, it had only 5 lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-elisp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;copy-buffer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Copy the complete buffer to the system clipboard&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;interactive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;kill-new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;filter-buffer-substring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;point-min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;point-max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main problem here was the terminology. The Emacs terminology for everything is &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;different&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yank&lt;/code&gt; – paste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kill&lt;/code&gt; – cut, that is, delete and copy to the kill ring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I wanted to do was &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;copy&lt;/span&gt;, I could find anything close to this in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Glossary&quot;&gt;Emacs glossary&lt;/a&gt;. After
reading some more, I realized that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kill-ring&lt;/code&gt; was similar to the clipboard and pushing things
onto that ring is the same as copying something. And that is how I reached this function
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kill-new&lt;/code&gt;. This function pushes it’s first argument to the ring =&amp;gt; essentially copying that string.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; This is the second in a series of 3 posts about my experience configuring Emacs over 7
months, starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/emacs/editors/tools/configuration/2020/11/15/configuring-emacs-7-months-later-act-1&quot;&gt;Post 1: Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/emacs/editors/tools/configuration/2020/11/21/configuring-emacs-7-months-later-act-2&quot;&gt;Post 2: Keybindings and Package Integration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/emacs/editors/tools/configuration/2020/12/01/configuring-emacs-7-months-later-act-3&quot;&gt;Post 3: Writing Emacs Lisp Functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;orgec4b729&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After figuring out how to install packages, as you start to use the editor more, you run into cases
where the keybindings are inconvenient or don’t exist at all. During this phase, the 3 months
between June and August, I added a lot of keybindings. Most of them were to mimic the functionality
that I had configured with Vim over some time. A lot of them were new keybindings which made sense
only in the Emacs world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I was using Emacs everyday for non-code related editing. Towards the end of this
period, I installed some major modes which allowed me to program in Go within Emacs, but my first
attempt at the installation of these modes was terrible and I had a very bad experience. After
giving up for a short period of time, I returned to the problem once again and figured it out the
second time around. This story is longer and I want to keep it for another blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#orgec4b729&quot;&gt;Act 2: Keybindings and Package Integration&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#org54cf0c5&quot;&gt;Navigation using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ctrl + H/J/K/L&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#orgc1a4811&quot;&gt;Keybindings to comment code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#org05e0dfd&quot;&gt;Hooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#orge17068c&quot;&gt;Mode maps for Keybindings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org54cf0c5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;navigation-using-ctrl--hjkl&quot;&gt;Navigation using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ctrl + H/J/K/L&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/.emacs.d/commit/c458cc48&quot;&gt;c458cc48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-elisp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;general-nmap&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;DEL&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;evil-ex-nohighlight&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;C-h&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;evil-window-left&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;C-j&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;evil-window-down&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;C-k&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;evil-window-up&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;C-l&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;evil-window-right&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigation between various splits using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ctrl&lt;/code&gt; and the Home row keys was another one of the base
requirements for me when I started using this editor. After installing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;general.el&lt;/code&gt; and reading
evil-guide 10-20 times, I was able to figure out how to add the appropriate bindings for moving
around splits using general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most confusing part of this were the quotation marks. Emacs allows functions to be specified
with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#&apos;&lt;/code&gt; or with a simple single quote. There does not seem to be any difference and you can use
either of those forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;orgc1a4811&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keybindings-to-comment-code&quot;&gt;Keybindings to comment code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/.emacs.d/commit/99683e0f&quot;&gt;99683e0f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-elisp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;; 24. Keybindings that use the leader key functionality in normal and visual mode&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;general-create-definer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;leader-def-visual-mode&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:states&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;visual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:prefix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;leader-def-visual-mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;c SPC&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;comment-or-uncomment-region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;general-create-definer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;leader-def-normal-mode&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:states&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:prefix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;leader-def-normal-mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;c SPC&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;comment-line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first section of the configuration which was more than just using a built-in function
directly. I was starting to understand what these functions were doing and I was able to get the
leader key behavior that I have always liked for commenting and un-commenting code in Vim. The
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;comment-or-uncomment-region&lt;/code&gt; function is a Emacs-only feature which inherently understands the
comment pattern for the language that is being edited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org05e0dfd&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hooks&quot;&gt;Hooks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/.emacs.d/commit/eae9cc91&quot;&gt;eae9cc91&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-elisp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;; 26. Remove trailing whitespace characters from all files&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;add-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;before-save-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;delete-trailing-whitespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hooks are a major part of Emacs. Until now, I have found that they are the main pathway for
connecting modes with each other (e.g.: Run the spell-checking mode when the file type is Org). They
are also very useful for doing things like the above configuration block, which deletes trailing
white spaces from all file types before saving the file to disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mode-maps-for-keybindings&quot;&gt;Mode maps for Keybindings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/.emacs.d/commit/71c9a782&quot;&gt;71c9a782&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-diff highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gd&quot;&gt;-  ;; TODO: This should be active only in the org mode key map
&lt;/span&gt;   (ctrl-keybindings
&lt;span class=&quot;gi&quot;&gt;+	:keymaps &apos;(org-mode-map)
&lt;/span&gt;	&quot;C-c l c&quot; &apos;org-cycle-list-bullet
&lt;span class=&quot;gi&quot;&gt;+   &quot;C-c e&quot; &apos;org-table-edit-formulas
&lt;/span&gt;	)
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gi&quot;&gt;+  ;; 23. SQL format highlighted region

+	&quot;gq&quot; &apos;run-sqlbeautify
+	)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another Emacs-only concept which was hard to understand for me when I tried to map it back
to the knowledge I had about editor configuration already. After a few months of getting used to
this, I am much more confident about adding new keybindings. For e.g., when I started testing
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed&quot;&gt;elfeed&lt;/a&gt; today, I added several keybindings within the first few hours of using it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/.emacs.d/commit/1c672f7a&quot;&gt;1c672f7a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-elisp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;; Elfeed Search&apos;s default mappings work are for Insert mode only&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;general-evil-define-key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;visual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;elfeed-search-mode-map&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;RET&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;elfeed-search-show-entry&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;u&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;elfeed-search-tag-all-unread&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;r&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;elfeed-search-untag-all-unread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evolution from not understanding what a mode map means or does, to understanding and being able
to use it properly was satisfying for me. This process takes time, and if you are switching to
something new and are having trouble not understanding things that everyone else treats as &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;basic&lt;/span&gt;,
I would tell you to simply stick with it for a few more months and see if you understand it better
then. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmGSJVG3mCRXVOP4yZrU1Dw&quot;&gt;Johnny Harris&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKDe094o-Q8&quot;&gt;a great video&lt;/a&gt; about how he figured out how to photograph far-away galaxies
that runs along the same lines.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; This is the first post in a series of 3 posts about my experience configuring Emacs over 7
months, starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/emacs/editors/tools/configuration/2020/11/15/configuring-emacs-7-months-later-act-1&quot;&gt;Post 1: Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first commit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/.emacs.d&quot;&gt;icyflame/.emacs.d&lt;/a&gt;, the repository with my Emacs configuration, was in April this
year (7 months ago). Now, I have reached a point at which I have cleaned up my configuration enough
to feel okay about making it open source. In this post and the two posts after this one, I will go
over some of the most important steps in my configuration’s evolution from scratch to it’s current
form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org7101517&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my configuration from scratch with a vanilla Emacs installation. This is a personal
preference; there are several configurations out there which allow people to start from a
opinionated configuration which they can understand and tweak to their needs. (There are even Emacs
distributions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/a&gt; which have a lot of the plugins which I configured manually already
installed!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is not really meant as a guide for the reader to get started with Emacs or copy my
configuration and use it as is; that is not my goal anyway. My main goal here is to talk about the
things in my configuration which feel obvious to me now, but were particularly difficult to figure
out when I initially tried to figure it out. Along the way, I will also try to share some of the fun
things I discovered about Emacs Lisp, a language that is equal parts fascinating and obscure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, if you plan to use parts of my configuration and are unable to figure out why something
is not working, I would love to hear your questions and help with figuring out the reason!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#org8b8b4a0&quot;&gt;Act 1: Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#orgc8426a7&quot;&gt;Package Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#orgff92eb3&quot;&gt;Evil mode and general.el&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#org9b39a7b&quot;&gt;Don’t install Helm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#org9dc088c&quot;&gt;Org mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org8b8b4a0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;act-1-fundamentals&quot;&gt;Act 1: Fundamentals&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right after installing Emacs, I wanted to figure out a stable method to install new packages from
using Emacs’ package management system. I wanted to ensure that this would be done using
configuration, and not using ad-hoc commands. My motive for this requirement was mainly the ease of
migrating this configuration between my personal and my work computer (I started using Emacs on my
personal Linux machine at home; I use a Macbook Pro at work (from home)). For the 2 months between
February and April, I was using Emacs everyday without any major changes to the base empty
configuration that every installation comes with. This was not a very good experience, and I kept
switching back to Vim whenever I had to do anything that was slightly more complicated than typing
text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;orgc8426a7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;package-management&quot;&gt;Package Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;require-package&lt;/code&gt; function from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d/blob/754a3ce1871f44c0c235887c18a32ac5dc799eb7/lisp/init-elpa.el#L29-L43&quot;&gt;purcell/emacs.d&lt;/a&gt;. Back then, I didn’t fully understand what
this function was doing. But the promise of this function was that it would provide a portable way
to install packages from Emacs’ package registry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://melpa.org/#/&quot;&gt;Melpa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-elisp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;;; from purcell/emacs.d&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;require-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;optional&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;min-version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;no-refresh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Install given PACKAGE, optionally requiring MIN-VERSION.
If NO-REFRESH is non-nil, the available package lists will not be
re-downloaded in order to locate PACKAGE.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;package-installed-p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;min-version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;assoc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;package-archive-contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;no-refresh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;package-install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;progn&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;package-refresh-contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;require-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;min-version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;orgff92eb3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;evil-mode-and-generalel&quot;&gt;Evil mode and general.el&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/.emacs.d/commit/4d083a63&quot;&gt;4d083a63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-elisp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;; 12. Install general package&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;require-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;general&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;; 13. Add key mappings for common actions using general&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;general-evil-setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;general-nmap&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;DEL&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;evil-ex-nohighlight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After figuring how to install packages, the first package I installed was &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;evil&lt;/code&gt;. This package
brings in most of Vim’s keybindings. Installing this package right at the beginning is a
double-edged knife, as it simultaneously makes Emacs more familiar &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; contributes to making
configuring Emacs harder to figure out. Evil’s configuration options are, &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;for the most part&lt;/span&gt;,
exactly the same as Vim. But the parts that are different are hard to understand and I was flummoxed
by these differences for about 2 months. During this period, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/noctuid/evil-guide&quot;&gt;noctuid/evil-guide&lt;/a&gt; was my main
reference. The Readme of this repository is comprehensive and explains everything about Evil mode. I
read this Readme several times to figure out exactly what was different, and how I could get rid of
these differences completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;general.el was a harder choice because I was not quite sure what this package did, but it was highly
rated and everyone seemed to be using it. evil-guide talked about this package with high regard, and
claimed that it would make configuring Evil mode easier. So, I took a leap of faith and decided to
install it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org9b39a7b&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-install-helm&quot;&gt;Don’t install Helm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm&quot;&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt; early on was a mistake. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm&quot;&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt; is an extremely powerful package, that is very hard to
use and understand. It is often referred to as a replacement for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ctrl-P&lt;/code&gt;, but in reality, it has a
lot more bells and whistles. These extra features make it very hard to understand where Helm ends
and where Emacs begins. Using Helm within an editor whose keybindings you are not yet familiar with
is hard. Personally, I think this was a big mistake and delayed my configuration efforts by about
the 2 weeks that it took me to realize what was going on and uninstall Helm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org9dc088c&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;org-mode&quot;&gt;Org mode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/.emacs.d/commit/22187304&quot;&gt;22187304&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-elisp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;; 18. Org mode settings&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;;; Set the done time for a TODO item when moving it to DONE&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;org-log-done&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&apos;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;org-todo-keywords&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;sequence&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;TODO(t)&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;WAITING(w@/!)&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;|&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;DONE(d!)&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;CANCELED(c@)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started using Org mode around April 28 when I made a commit to introduce the TODO states that I
wanted to have in my Org file. This was right after watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTwQvgfgMM&quot;&gt;original talk about Org-mode&lt;/a&gt;. I am
glad that I started using this early on as I was able to understand a lot more about how Emacs works
as an editor (For e.g.: keybinding maps per mode, the global mode, minor modes, mode hooks) by
configuring Org-mode, a non-programming mode whose configuration is much easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Discovering Org Mode</title>
   <link href="/2020/10/25/discovering-org-mode"/>
   <updated>2020-10-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/10/25/discovering-org-mode</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I talked about some of the &lt;a href=&quot;/emacs/editors/tools/2020/07/08/vim-and-emacs/&quot;&gt;problems with Markdown&lt;/a&gt; that I was facing in my daily note-taking at work
and at home. I had been looking for a replacement for my note taking system since early this
year. Org mode seemed like a good candidate and a few people recommended it to me, so I started
using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have used Org mode for about 6 months at work and at home. In my personal life, I managed the
move to a new apartment and switching to a new mobile phone provider entirely using a single
sub-tree in my notes file. At work, I have used Org for a few months now as I worked on a variety of
Search and SRE tasks; a lot of them included huge files and ad-hoc Perl scripts which were written
almost entirely within Org and are still stored only inside Org. This post is about my experience
with Org mode and a list of the things that I believe are the strengths and weaknesses of this
markup language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org4edb750&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-org-mode&quot;&gt;What is Org mode?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Org mode is a major mode for Emacs. A major mode is like a filetype in Vim. It has a bunch of
special formatting logic and functions that only work in that mode. Emacs is always in a major mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Org mode also refers to the mark-up language that can be written within this major mode. This
mark-up language is a lot like Markdown if you look at the plaintext. For example, here’s a quick
sample with some common things that markup languages can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;* Title
** Subtitle

Normal, *bold* and _emphasised_ text.

- Lists
- look
- the
- same
  - even with indentation
  - and list items with embedded code are dealt with properly
	#+BEGIN_SRC php
	public function getID() {
		return $this-&amp;gt;id;
	}
	#+END_SRC

| Tables | Look |
|--------+------|
| The    | Same |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the markup is similar to Markdown, it’s extremely easy to switch to Org &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; Markdown. In fact,
you don’t even need to think a lot about whether you are writing Org or Markdown except for headings
where the character changes from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;. So, there’s nothing particularly special about the
markup language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening this file in Emacs won’t be very impressive either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/discovering-org-mode-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file looks slightly better; this is only stylized Markdown though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Org mode really starts differentiating itself is when you start editing it. Here’s my quick, 3-part
pitch to get people intrigued and try it at least once:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lists:&lt;/strong&gt; Org mode (the layer of code sitting between the plaintext and your editor) inherently
understands your list. So, when you type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Alt + Return&lt;/code&gt;, it will create a new list item.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you are in a numbered list, it will check the numbers of all your list items from the top and fix any&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;discrepancies&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Alt + Up arrow&lt;/code&gt; will move the current list item up; once again, if you are in a&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;numbered list, the numbers will automatically be adjusted for all list items at that level&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If the list item you are moving has child items, they will also be moved alongwith the parent
item!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editorial note:&lt;/strong&gt; I was writing this blog post in Markdown, but the nested list item that I
was trying to create using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Alt + Right arrow&lt;/code&gt;, didn’t have any effect. So, I copied the text
over to an Org file and pasted it as is. After doing that, I just had to do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Alt + Enter&lt;/code&gt; to
align the list items and start editing the text as Org mode text.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO list management, heading filtering:&lt;/strong&gt; A common notes file has a lot of heirarchy and notes
at several levels. Some of these notes will be TODO items that need to be done, or were done in
the past. Org mode has in-built management of these lists using plaintext markers.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Like other TODO management software, there are a lot of ways to visualize the things you need to do&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;There are even some features that allow you to schedule TODOs in the future and then look at
your day’s agenda (I have started using this feature recently)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tables:&lt;/strong&gt; Tables automatically align when you press Tab. I have not seen any application except
Emacs which can do this so well. There are several GUI applications which can do this well, and
theoretically, you can run them in Vim mode and get the same result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org6a94b39&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;strengths&quot;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about what I wanted to put here for a while. I finally decided to put the features of Org
that I use daily. Org can do a lot of other crazy things but I have found that I don’t use them as
much. (&lt;strong&gt;For eg:&lt;/strong&gt; Org tables have a spreadsheet like feature which allows you to write formulas, but
LibreOffice’s Calc blows this out of the water. So, I did not use that feature as much within org)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org08d0609&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lists-tables-todos&quot;&gt;Lists, Tables, TODOs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said above in my quick pitch, Org mode understands Lists and Tables. By understand, I mean
that it understands Lists as computers understand arrays. For eg, it knows that the top element
can’t be moved above it’s current position because it’s already at index 0! For sublists, it has
(probably) something like a pointer inside it which lets it know that when the parent pointer is
moved up, the sublist should also move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This understanding of lists allows it to do things like change the leading character of a list to
anything that you want with a simple keybinding (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shift + Left/Right arrow&lt;/code&gt;). A program like Vim is
working with Lists using regular expressions. These expressions are bound to run into corner cases
which will be fixed with a more granular Regex … &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;ad infinitum&lt;/span&gt;. My most common use-cases for
lists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;List of PRs for a given feature (the order in which they need to be merged, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Release plans (say: to be shared for review)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Org mode is pretty good list numbering tool. If you have a list of lines with content that
you would like to number for some reason, you can do this by prepending the whole list with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/code&gt; and
then using Org’s “Fix list” bindings (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shift + Right/Left&lt;/code&gt;) to number the list properly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With tables, this behavior is pushed even further as Org behaves with tables almost like any
Spreadsheet software. It is better than them, in my opinion, because of it’s ability to quickly
change the width of all columns based on the content. With spreadsheet software, one would have to
use the mouse and extend the column manually. All of this done with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TAB&lt;/code&gt; key: Type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;| CONTENT |
CONTENT | &amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a table is started and each column is the width of the column with the longest
content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Vim keybindings, adding a column is done by simply highlighting the table and using block
editing (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ctrl-V&lt;/code&gt;) to append or prepend a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;. My most common use-cases for tables:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pros/Cons list when comparing options / designs / implementations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use-cases for a given feature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comparing various external libraries/services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also often converted between lists and tables:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;CONTENT&amp;gt;: &amp;lt;VALUE&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;| &amp;lt;CONTENT&amp;gt; | &amp;lt;VALUE&amp;gt; |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fairly easy if the list is not nested. As tables look better, there’s a constant temptation
to express information properly as tables, rather than lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org5a03ed1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;embedding-code&quot;&gt;Embedding code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#+BEGIN_SRC php
$ docker run -it --name=php php:latest php -a
Interactive shell

php &amp;gt; $password = &quot;t&quot;;
php &amp;gt; $h = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
php &amp;gt; echo $h;
$2y$10$F6exUnYVDd.W4DSs0I8fdOssGPdj57L3pvmjef5oHEg8qdoahTONS
php &amp;gt; var_dump(password_verify($password, $h));
bool(true)
php &amp;gt;
#+END_SRC
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The markup for embedding code is verbose in Org. It consists of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#+BEGIN_SRC&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#+END_SRC&lt;/code&gt; along
with the language of the code that is embedded. I am still trying to figure out if there is some way
to embed using Markdown’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt; &lt;/code&gt;`. Looking past the markup, this code renders with the proper syntax
highlighting for the embedded language. So, within an Org file, you can have code from any language
and it will all be highlighted according to &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; language’s highlighting rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When exporting to PDF or Markdown, the embedded code is also exported as expected. I have had some
issues with several embedded code blocks that follow one another though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org32b2109&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exporting-to-plaintext--markdown--odt--docx&quot;&gt;Exporting to Plaintext / Markdown / ODT / Docx&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in a company with a few different platforms for sharing information. We use Slack,
Confluence, Jira and Google Docs. There is no underlying reason for the tool that will be used in
any given meeting or project and it often varies depending on the people that I work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives rise to the need for a documentation tool that will export to all of those formats. Here,
Org mode blows Markdown out of the water. Exporting out to another format is a first-class feature
in Org mode. There are some really good exporters that are included by default. Of these, I have
found Plaintext and Docx to be the most portable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Docx files can be created using Org’s ODT export function. ODT is used as an intermediate
format. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.docx&lt;/code&gt; file can be imported into Drive and opened using Google Docs. Google Docs now
has a dedicated “Docx”-supported mode which allows you to collaborate and edit a Docx file!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Org’s lists and Tables can be copied as is and pasted into Slack or Confluence in their code blocks
section. They look good on any screen that’s not a phone screen! This allows you to export without
any other tool, by simply copying the markup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more involved exporting (like text with Embedded code), I use the Plaintext export to get a
UTF-8 buffer which I can copy and paste into Confluence / Jira / Slack’s text snippet or embedded
code markup object! The plaintext that comes out of the Embedded code is particularly good
looking. Embedded code is wrapped on the left with a box made of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; characters!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testimonial:&lt;/strong&gt; When I shared my notes from an important internal HR meeting widely as a plaintext
snippet on Slack, one coworker sent this message to the channel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your notes are beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have shared notes written in Markdown several times before this, but I have never gotten this kind
of a message! Clearly, the plaintext export is generating very good looking files. (&lt;a href=&quot;/public/data/discovering-org-mode-example.txt&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is the
file generated when I exported to UTF-8 plaintext from &lt;a href=&quot;/public/data/discovering-org-mode-example.org.txt&quot;&gt;this example Org file&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;orgf55df97&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;weaknesses&quot;&gt;Weaknesses&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org02abef9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;single-notes-file&quot;&gt;Single notes file&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using Org mode for about 6 months now and perhaps the most annoying weakness for me is
that I have put all my notes in a single file. Now, due to Org’s intuitive hierarchical structure,
it will be extremely easy to move the notes to separate files by project. But I have not yet figured
out how to get Org mode to search across several Org files. For now, as all of my notes are in a
single file, I have to be extremely careful about destructive actions that I take within this
file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a script which commits to Git every 15 minutes. I started doing this after I lost about 20%
of my notes file during a bad edit in which I deleted a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; block. When I deleted it, I had no
clue that this ellipsis represented a block of Org and was not just something that Org added to my
underlying text file. I am still trying to control my instinct to delete lines that have only an
ellipsis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;orgc079228&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strange-export-behavior&quot;&gt;Strange export behavior&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some “properties” which can be set on every title / heading. These including some useful
ones like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EXPORT_TITLE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EXPORT_AUTHOR&lt;/code&gt;. Unfortunately, I haven’t really gotten them to work
properly until now. Often, when I am trying to export a single title, it will not use the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EXPORT_TITLE&lt;/code&gt; that is provided in the heading and instead use the title from the file’s properties!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Export properties are probably being used by the actual driver which handles the export from
Org mode to the appropriate format. So, some drivers do handle this properly, whereas some don’t!
(&lt;strong&gt;For e.g.:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EXPORT_OPTIONS&lt;/code&gt; is a common property which can be used to turn off
subscript/superscript support (useful when writing notes with variable names) and turn off the Table
of contents (useful when exporting to Plaintext); this property doesn’t work with the Plaintext
exporter)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Building and running GnuCash in Docker</title>
   <link href="/2020/09/13/docker-and-gnucash"/>
   <updated>2020-09-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/09/13/docker-and-gnucash</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/tag/#gnucash&quot;&gt;GnuCash&lt;/a&gt; a few times before. I have been using GnuCash version 2.6 for
nearly 2 years now. A lot of the features that were added after this version weren’t really useful
for my use-case, so I never upgraded. Also, the binary that is distributed through the Ubuntu App
store / apt-get repositories is v2.6. Versions after that were not published to the aptitude
repositories, for some reason. (A lot of software packages do this)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I ran into a very strange &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=797926&quot;&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to report this bug to the GnuCash team and
get their feedback on if this was something that they had seen before. To avoid reporting a bug on
an old version which was no longer being supported actively, I got the latest version of the GnuCash
code and started a long, uphill battle to build it locally! This post is a summary of that
experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are looking to run the latest version of GnuCash inside Docker, you can get this
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/dockerfiles/blob/master/gnucash/Dockerfile#L1-L9&quot;&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/a&gt; and build the Docker image. The command to run it on an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS host is
given at the top of the Dockerfile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GnuCash has some documentation about building on Linux. It starts with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Building_On_Linux#Setting_up_to_Build_GnuCash_on_Linux&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; called
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Building On Linux&lt;/code&gt;. Going from this page, I kept jumping to several subsequent pages which felt
strange and I was soon confused about what I was looking for in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the short summary of what I learnt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GnuCash is written in C&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building the software has two distinct steps:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configuring the build: For this, we use Cmake&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build (for real): For this, we use Make&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The build directory must be completely separate from the source directory&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;tree &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-L&lt;/span&gt; 1
 &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
 ├── gnucash-4.1
 ├── gnucash-build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the structure that I used. We will be running all of the commands inside the build
 directory. In this example, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gnucash-build/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;required-packages&quot;&gt;Required packages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me quite some time to figure out exactly where all the files should go and what came first,
etc. Once I had figured out the purposes of Cmake and Make, things got a little bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;gnucash-build&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;cmake ../gnucash-4.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command will most probably fail, unless you have all the dependencies installed. If this
command does not fail, then you can switch to the next step: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Build&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this command failed several times. Each time it failed, it output either an error with the
name of a package that was missing or a warning with a particular part of GnuCash that it couldn’t
configure properly because of missing dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warnings&quot;&gt;Warnings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to remove two parts of GnuCash to get past the warnings: &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/AqBanking&quot;&gt;AQBanking&lt;/a&gt; and SQL support. After
seeing the warnings, I wasn’t quite sure how to disable them. A quick look at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CMakeLists.txt&lt;/code&gt;
file helped me figure that out. I don’t know how to read CMake files, so I just winged this part. I
found a few mentions to the actual option and found these lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;option &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;WITH_SQL &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Build this project with SQL (libdbi) support&quot;&lt;/span&gt; ON&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
option &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;WITH_AQBANKING &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Build this project with aqbanking (online banking) support&quot;&lt;/span&gt; ON&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finding this option, I discovered that cmake takes configuration options using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-D&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;var&amp;gt;[:&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;]=&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Create a cmake cache entry.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-D&lt;/code&gt;’s description is confusing, but it’s the option we want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this, I reached the command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;gnucash-build&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;cmake &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-DWITH_AQBANKING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-DWITH_SQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; ../gnucash-4.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running this on my Ubuntu 18.04 installation gave me an error mentioning the name of a missing
library. I went ahead and installed the library and ran &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cmake&lt;/code&gt; again. I repeated this step several
times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;errors&quot;&gt;Errors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cmake configures the build by ensuring that each library that is required is available on the host
and is in a location that can be found by Make (or it will tell Make to find it wherever Cmake found
the library). As I saw each warning, the name of the library I needed to install was either clear to
me from the error or I had to run a search on &lt;a href=&quot;https://packages.ubuntu.com&quot;&gt;packages.ubuntu.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had 22 required packages missing. The complete list of packages can be found in the final
Dockerfile’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apt-get install&lt;/code&gt; command &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/dockerfiles/blob/53820e4377779bd4c5364b864a760828484db3cd/gnucash/Dockerfile#L16-L38&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This step took the most time at about 90
minutes. After 4-5 steps, the process was pretty clear to me. A couple of things that I learnt
during this process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For building software, almost always the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-dev&lt;/code&gt; versions of packages are required. For example, I
had the package &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;libxslt1.1&lt;/code&gt; installed. This wasn’t enough though. Cmake kept telling me that the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xsltproc&lt;/code&gt; could not be found. This was because I didn’t have &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;libxslt1-dev&lt;/code&gt; package. After
installing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-dev&lt;/code&gt; version of this package, I was able to go to the next missing package.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can check what packages are already installed using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dpkg -l&lt;/code&gt;. Using a tool like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;
allows you to quickly check whether a package is missing or if there’s some sort of version
conflict: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dpkg -l | grep xslt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For most packages, I was able to install them fairly easily. For 2 packages (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;libglib2.0-dev&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;libxslt&lt;/code&gt;), I was not able to install the required package for a few minutes. After moving around
searches, installing and removing packages, checking &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dpkg -l&lt;/code&gt; output, and reading the error
message several times, I was able to install the required package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build&quot;&gt;Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual build part of this process is extremely easy. Cmake ensures that everything that was
required has been installed and can be found in their usual locations. If not, Cmake will tell make
where to find them using the Makefiles that cmake generates when the configuration process is
complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;gnucash-build&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;make
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command will run for a considerable amount of time. On my laptop with an i7 8th gen processor
and 16 GB of RAM, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; ran for about 20-30 minutes (I didn’t track this closely; I was relieved to
have reached this stage and I didn’t really care even if this command took a few hours as I was
probably not going to run this command again EVER)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; is done, your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gnucash&lt;/code&gt; binary should be inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gnucash-build/bin&lt;/code&gt;. There will be some
more binary files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;gnucash-build&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;ls &lt;/span&gt;bin

gnc-fq-dump   gnc-fq-update  gnucash-cli  jenny

&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;gnucash-build&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;./bin/gnucash &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--version&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have built most of the small utilities that I use on a daily basis (like my recent favorite,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/at-ishikawa/git-fzf&quot;&gt;git-fzf&lt;/a&gt;). GnuCash was one of the major parts of my computer usage and I am glad that I can
actually build the software which is able to parse the huge &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.xml.gz&lt;/code&gt; file which contains all my
accounting information!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Hope and Independence</title>
   <link href="/2020/08/01/hope-independence-a-story"/>
   <updated>2020-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/08/01/hope-independence-a-story</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This post is different from the typical posts that I are on this blog. It is about
something that made me think when I watched a TV show recently. I will explain the set-up of a story
I heard on the show. After that, please take some time to think about what you would do if you were
the character in that story. Then, move on to the next section which will show the original ending
of the story, and the ending that came to my mind right before I heard the original ending on the
show (there’s a pause in the show).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-set-up&quot;&gt;The set-up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was a girl who was very sick. There was a tree outside her room that she saw
everyday through a window. Seeing the leaves on the tree fall off, she told her father that when all
the trees had fallen off of the tree, she would die too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her father, hearing this, decided to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At this point, take a moment. What would you do if you were the little girl’s father?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ending&quot;&gt;The ending&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went to the tree when there was only one leaf left on it. He stuck the leaf to the tree with
glue, ensuring that it will never fall off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every morning, the little girl would wake up and see the leaf on the tree. Seeing that one leaf
hang on for life, would rejuvenate the little girl’s will to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-alternate-ending&quot;&gt;An alternate ending&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I heard the set-up of this story, I thought of a very different ending. I did not think about
what the father in the story did at all. This is what I thought the father would do:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing his daughter connect her will to live to the tree outside her window, he realized what he
needed to do. The next morning, he took his daughter out to the tree and said to her: “This tree, it
has nothing to do with how long you will live. You will live a long, happy, full life.” He started
plucking the leaves one by one from the tree. His daughter panicked, she looked at him, not
understanding why her father was doing this. Her eyes filled with tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few minutes, her father had plucked all the leaves on the tree except for one. He took his
daughter’s hand and brought her closer to the tree. He asked her to pluck the final leaf. The little
girl, afraid of what might come about, refused to do so. Her father took her hand and wrapped it
around the leaf and pulled it from the tree. The leaf was in the little girl’s hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at it, the little girl understood that she did not need the tree to continue living;
everything she needed was within herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of stories that are meant to give people who have lost hope a chance to regain
it. Constantly, we hear them in TV shows, on YouTube videos that are released in the last week of
every December, from journalists who have seen something heart-warming in the toughest of
terrains. They are all trying to desperately convince the viewer that “The searches for hope
outnumbered the searches for fear.” (something from one of Google’s “Year in review” videos)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they are meant to enforce the narrative of being a collective, of being together, of
fighting crises by joining forces, of not being alone. Allowing anyone to connect their life to
something outside of themselves seems unnecessary. Why should the little girl have to depend on the
existence of leaves on a tree to continue living?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Take Smart Notes (Ahrens)</title>
   <link href="/2020/07/09/book-review-take-smart-notes"/>
   <updated>2020-07-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/07/09/book-review-take-smart-notes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read this book after seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3189699850?book_show_action=false&amp;amp;from_review_page=1&quot;&gt;Sreejith’s 5-star review&lt;/a&gt;. It was a habit-changing book for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important take-away for me was the difference between a writer and an archivist. As I have
been reading more and more non-fiction books in the past couple years, I realized that there were
several connections that I was noticing but wasn’t really making on paper anywhere. I was making
notes about separate pieces of literature, but I wasn’t really connecting them. My behavior was that
of an archivist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To move into a writer’s mindset I realized that I have to start thinking about how anything I read
is changing my mindset and actually write my thoughts down (apart from the things that have already
been said by the author).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few other things that were expressed very well in the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Writing is everything; everything must lead to writing; the final written piece could be a
research paper or something that you never publish, etc; but everything you do around “research”
must have a single goal: To write something about it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Writing is the process of understanding: Reading something, understanding the gist and the
meaning, and writing it down your understanding improves the understanding process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who take hand-written notes better understand the material, when compared to people who are
taking notes with a computer: I want to read the study on this. The author’s reasoning is that
writing is slower than typing and hence we prepare ourselves to cut through the peripheries of the
speaker’s arguments and get to the gist as quickly as you can and in as few words as you
can. Everything else that’s part of the understanding process has to happen in your mind before
you write down your understanding.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I took hand-written notes for nearly 5 years in college. My understanding wasn’t really
improved a lot because mostly I was simply copying what was being written on the board into my
notebook. I was postponing the understanding to the 2 weeks before the test.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once a piece is written down, what you meant is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is what
you wrote down. Any piece disconnected from it’s author has the same goal: to make a convincing
argument. And the author gives a clear description of a convincing argument:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The criteria for a convincing argument are always the same, regardless of who the author is or the
status of the publisher: They have to be coherent and based on facts. Truth does not belong to
anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas. This is why the
presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the
same coin (Peters and Schäfer 2006, 9). If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing
else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Categorizing the information that is being fed into students in colleges into neat topics and
grouping everything together is detrimentary to the student: Frequent context switching, using
tests as a means to show students what they need to learn instead of using them to simply ensure
that they are learning what they should have, allowing students to decide their curriculum
autonomously&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoiding feedback in the short term is disastrous: It leads to feeling smarter in the present,
instead of &lt;em&gt;becoming&lt;/em&gt; smarter in the future&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal:&lt;/strong&gt; Developing new ideas; connecting a variety of pieces together; answering the questions
you have concretely; writing down your &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; idea because no other book has exactly what you are
looking for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S&lt;/strong&gt; In a crazy connection, the author says that the book about the rise of the shipping
container, The Box, that I read a few months ago was one of the reasons he realized that simple
ideas find it especially hard to become popular and widely adopted. I read The Box because of my
interest in shipping containers and the logistics world in general only a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started looking into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam&quot;&gt;Org roam&lt;/a&gt; in the past couple days. With my &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/emacs/editors/tools/2020/07/08/vim-and-emacs/&quot;&gt;recent switch to start
using Emacs&lt;/a&gt; more in my daily workflow, I think integrating Org roam and using it to take notes
should be easy to begin. I want to write notes about some of the topics that I have read about in
the past few months (and heard podcasts about) that are connected to each other:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Literature: Technological Progress (Mokyr)

the time when the printing press was invented&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Literature: Differences between China and Europe
        &lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
          &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Oriental things in high demand in Europe, but no matching demand in the East for things
made in the West. Why?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Literature: Short History of the 20th Century - Lukacs
    &lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Wars can’t be won using air strikes alone, you need an army on the ground&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Literature: The Box
    &lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Simple idea, execution required some critical scale though&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Some unions blocked this idea constantly, while others did not; why?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Ezra Klein Show with that organizer
    &lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Why are unions good?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;The people who are good at their job have good relationships with their boss and won’t
participate in union activities&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Vox video about Afghanistan
    &lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;No central government has succeeded in Afghanistan; why?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book advises you to simply start writing notes for new literature that you read and forget about
everything that you read until now. Some of the books I read in the past couple years were extremely
important though, so I am definitely going to put my reading on hold for a week or so and actually
write these notes down and get a good workflow going with my slipbox and reference system.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Using Emacs - A trial</title>
   <link href="/2020/07/08/vim-and-emacs"/>
   <updated>2020-07-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/07/08/vim-and-emacs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been used Vim for a while now. In university, my Vim usage was mostly related to the work I
did in student groups. This probably came out to about 20-25 hours a week, on average. I used it to
write my bachelors and masters thesis in LaTeX, which was probably the smoothest workflow I could
have had for writing something that was about 80 pages long. Once I started working, my usage
increased to nearly 40-45 hours a week. I was writing notes and code in Vim every weekday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this increased usage, the problems with Vim really started coming to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problems&quot;&gt;Problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-inability-to-understand-codebases&quot;&gt;An inability to understand codebases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reading a huge PHP code base at work. I resorted to IntelliJ for PHP because IntelliJ IDEA
really understands PHP code well, I couldn’t see how I would move around an unfamiliar code base on
an editor that did not support it well enough. I tried ctags frontends, but they were not sufficient
because switching to the function &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getUser&lt;/code&gt; on the line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$transaction-&amp;gt;getUser()&lt;/code&gt; using ctags would
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; lead to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transaction&lt;/code&gt; class inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;models/&lt;/code&gt;, instead going to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ACL::getUser&lt;/code&gt; !?! (I later
discovered that it is possible to switch between tag locations after the first jump; still not
really very syntax aware)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-inability-to-do-things-in-the-background&quot;&gt;An inability to do things in the background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of has been said about this. Neovim is one of the popular alternatives that fixes the
problem. I switched over from Vim to Neovim in February. They are basically the same underlying
program, so I didn’t notice a drastic change just from this switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;poor-handling-of-nested-lists-within-markdown&quot;&gt;Poor handling of nested lists within Markdown&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was writing all my notes in Markdown. This was working well. I had a file for each month and a
heading for each day. Inside each heading, I started taking notes that were nested lists. This is a
sample block that is typical of the notes I was taking: (made up)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-markdown highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Meeting: Some topic 1

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;			-&lt;/span&gt; Put logic in service A?
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;				-&lt;/span&gt; Service A has too much logic
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;				-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`internal/src/partner/logic.go`&lt;/span&gt; =&amp;gt; Too much unrelated logic in this file, this has
				already caused a few incidents during release
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;			-&lt;/span&gt; Service B

		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Unmarshal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Since&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CachedAt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Minute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;callExternalService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

			&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resp&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;	-&lt;/span&gt; Resolution
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;		-&lt;/span&gt; Feature 1 in next sprint
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;		-&lt;/span&gt; Logic in service B for now, move to microservice if prototype is successful
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the meeting was complete, I would look through it again and edit it to fix grammar or
indentation and remove redundancies, elaborate things that weren’t immediately clear, make sure I
didn’t miss anything. After this editing step, I would instinctively use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gqip&lt;/code&gt; to reformat
everything and make it look pretty again. This step would reformat the code block as if it was plain
text! This was clearly a problem. The editor didn’t understand that this text is special and
shouldn’t be touched when reformatting the text around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started getting involved in more projects and my notes started becoming more complicated and
the levels of nesting grew, this problem became worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theory&quot;&gt;Theory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim doesn’t understand the text that is being edited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about any language that has a structure which allows identifiers to have the same name but
have different meanings when used with different objects. &lt;strong&gt;Eg:&lt;/strong&gt; PHP, Ruby (Inheritance, dynamic
type), JavaScript (types, definitions not required), Markdown (freeform).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editing these languages in Vim is hard because simple text processing tools are NOT enough. There
has to be a layer on top of the text processing that sits in between the text and the text processor
and tells the text processor how to deal with each line of the text. This layer has the logic that
is required to recognize that a line within a codeblock in Markdown shouldn’t be touched or (the
much more involved interference) that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getUser()&lt;/code&gt; function called on a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transaction&lt;/code&gt; object is
in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;transaction.php&lt;/code&gt;, not in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;acl.php&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, take an extremely well-formed language like Golang: It comes with an excellent
set of tools that sit between the text and the editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eg:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gofmt&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; Every time the user asks the editor to save a file, the editor sends the file to
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gofmt&lt;/code&gt; and saves the output instead!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gopls&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;guru&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; When the user taps &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;C-]&lt;/code&gt;, the editor passes the cursor location to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gopls&lt;/code&gt; and
loads the file and line, column number that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gopls&lt;/code&gt; returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there were such tools for PHP, I am sure that PHP editing would be just as efficient as Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a novel theory, it has been put forth by other people, in other forms. I simply realized
it all over again from my own experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/&quot;&gt;Language Server Protocol&lt;/a&gt; is a
great project that aims to solve all these issues! I want to try PHP with it’s language server in
Vim and in Emacs. (Emacs with Company in the LSP mode is actually a very powerful LSP frontend)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution-trial&quot;&gt;Solution (trial)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching editors seemed like the easiest solution to this problem. I wouldn’t be able to switch
editors quickly; I started looking for alternatives anyway. Emacs stood out as the overwhelmingly
popular and well-loved alternative. There were three talks that convinced me to start this trial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWD1Fpdd4Pc&quot;&gt;Evil mode: How I learned to stop worry and love Emacs (5 years ago)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTwQvgfgMM&quot;&gt;Emacs Org mode - A system for notes taking and project planning (11 years ago)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4&quot;&gt;Getting started with Org mode (4 years ago)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common thread in all these talks was that the speakers had become frustrated with the tools they
were using and had decided to switch to another tool. They were not making an impassioned argument
for any one tool, they were talking about how inefficient it can be to use the wrong tool. I had
reached a similar point in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to get used to Emacs enough to be able to use it as my primary editor on local computers. For
remote instances, I will stick to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;. My familiarity with the Vim keybindings is quite useful in
this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Notes and Review - Lean In (Sandberg)</title>
   <link href="/2020/06/01/lean-in-review"/>
   <updated>2020-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/06/01/lean-in-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are a million reviews of this book out there, I don’t think I have
anything new to say about the book. I do want to look at how Sandberg approaches
the root cause of the issue that she deals with in this book: not enough women
in leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She begins by dividing the barriers into two categories: Internal and
External. This was a very useful framework to think about the issue and try to
improve the situation by making structural changes. The book is full of
anecdotes, her conversations, and her advice to several groups of people. It is
also relentlessly researched, there are no assertions or gut feelings in this
book, everything is based on numbers from studies. For me, this was a book both
about the main issue and a book about careers and how to make decisions that
will affect you a few years down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;highlights&quot;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things I took away from this book that changed the way I think:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunity cost:&lt;/strong&gt; This quote &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; got me thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is always an opportunity cost, and I don’t know anyone who feels
comfortable with all their decisions. As a result, we inadvertently hold that
discomfort against those who remind us of the path not taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the people I resented and have resented in the past, I can see them
enter this criteria almost all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural advantages:&lt;/strong&gt; There are structural advantages that are not
explicitly enforced, but do exist and favor the in-group, at the cost of the
out-group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example that Sandberg talks about around the beginning of the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more men in leadership roles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;men prefer working with other men&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more men get promoted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women pay the price for this structural advantage that men have. &lt;strong&gt;They don’t
get promotions despite appearing to have the same opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the other things that I have heard in passing but did not understand
completely before I read this book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success and likeability:&lt;/strong&gt; Positively correlated for men, negatively
correlated for women. This was counter intuitive for me as I tend to
like the people around me and am ambivalent about the people way above (2 or 3
levels up the report line) “Women who are liked are perceived as more nice
than competent, but men who are liked are perceived as both nice and
competent”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping coworkers:&lt;/strong&gt; Women pay a bigger price for not helping their
coworkers than men who decline to help others
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“Pronouns matter: Women should use the pronoun &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;” =&amp;gt;
This is similar to one of the observations that Ezra Klein made about
Hillary Clinton when she said that one of the things that she had to learn
and keep track of consciously was how she was taking credit for her
accomplishments and how she taught herself to say I on the campaign trail
instead of saying we.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picking a new job:&lt;/strong&gt; The only thing that matters when picking a job is
growth. If a company is growing fast, there will be a lot of things to do and
not enough people to do them. This pushes you into doing things that you would
not consider a conventional part of your role. If a company is stagnant, there
are a lot of people not doing anything.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This was articulate and the first time I have heard it phrased like
that. I am definitely going to use this in my own career.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applying for positions:&lt;/strong&gt; Women apply for jobs only when they meet 100% of
the criteria, whereas men apply if they meet 60% or above. This is another
structural area that comes back later in the book. She points to a doctor at a
hospital who found out that his female students won’t raise their hand as
often as his male students. So, he goes about fixing it by getting rid of open
ended questions and instead pin-pointing people and asking them to answer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t plan too far into the future; leaving a baby at home and
returning to work will be very hard and the only thing that can make it worth
your while is if you have a job that you are excited about.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having it all:&lt;/strong&gt; Perfection at work and home is impossible beyond a certain
point. You must re-prioritize and decide what tasks can’t be compromised
on. For people who are at the top of their fields (eg: Yale Law students),
finding a mix at work and home is especially fraught with problems because
they are used to demanding the very best from themselves and when this becomes
impossible, they try to compensate by sacrificing sleep, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nouns and adjectives:&lt;/strong&gt; Whoever has more power takes over the noun:
(engineer, female engineer), (nurse, male nurse)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lockjam:&lt;/strong&gt; Talking about gender at work is hard, awkward and dangerous for
managers and employees. There are legal implications that most people and HR
departments would prefer to sidestep rather than wade through. &lt;em&gt;Once we
recognize what is wrong, we can not help but work to change it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender:&lt;/strong&gt; When asked to pick someone to collaborate with on a task, most
people pick someone from the same gender! Organizations have to work
explicitly to fix this skew by pushing people who don’t work with each other
together for made-up reasons (eg: team building)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This was a convincing reason for the “team building activities” that are
in vogue lately&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To this day, I’m embarrassed that I didn’t realize that pregnant women needed
reserved parking until I experienced my own aching feet. As one of Google’s
most senior women, didn’t I have a special responsibility to think of this?
But like Sergey, it had never occurred to me. The other pregnant women must
have suffered in silence, not wanting to ask for special treatment. Or maybe
they lacked the confidence or seniority to demand that the problem be
fixed. Having one pregnant woman at the top—even one who looked like a
whale—made the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don’t remember thinking about my future career differently from the male
students. I also don’t remember any conversations about someday balancing work
and children. My friends and I assumed that we would have both. Men and women
competed openly and aggressively with one another in classes, activities, and
job interviews. Just two generations removed from my grandmother, the playing
field seemed to be level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This experiment supports what research has already clearly shown: success and
likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for
women.3 When a man is successful, he is liked by both men and women. When a
woman is successful, people of both genders like her less. This truth is both
shocking and unsurprising: shocking because no one would ever admit to
stereotyping on the basis of gender and unsurprising because clearly we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then he explained that only one criterion mattered when picking a job—fast
growth. When companies grow quickly, there are more things to do than there
are people to do them. When companies grow more slowly or stop growing, there
is less to do and too many people to not be doing them. Politics and
stagnation set in, and everyone falters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One thing that helps is to remember that feedback, like truth, is not
absolute. Feedback is an opinion, grounded in observations and experiences,
which allows us to know what impression we make on others. The information is
revealing and potentially uncomfortable, which is why all of us would rather
offer feedback to those who welcome it. If I make an observation or
recommendation and someone reacts badly—or even just visibly tenses up—I
quickly learn to save my comments for things that really matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But even if mothers are more naturally inclined toward nurturing, fathers can
match that skill with knowledge and effort. If women want to succeed more at
work and if men want to succeed more at home, these expectations have to be
challenged. As Gloria Steinem once observed, “It’s not about biology, but
about consciousness.”9 We overcome biology with consciousness in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;True partnership in our homes does more than just benefit couples today; it
also sets the stage for the next generation. The workplace has evolved more
than the home in part because we enter it as adults, so each generation
experiences a new dynamic. But the homes we create tend to be more rooted in
our childhoods. My generation grew up watching our mothers do the child care
and housework while our fathers earned the wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I started noticing how often employees were judged not by their objective
performance, but by the subjective standard of how well they fit in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dr. John Probasco of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine told me
that my story about women being more reluctant than men to raise their hands
rang true for him so he decided to do away with the old hand-raising system
during rounds. Instead, he started calling on male and female students
evenly. He quickly realized that the women knew the answers just as well—or
even better—than the men. In one day he increased female participation. By
making one small change to his behavior, he changed a much larger dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Without calling for major overhauls, they tackled the soft stuff—small
adjustments students could make immediately, like paying more attention to the
language they used in class. They laid out a new, communal definition of
leadership: “Leadership is about making others better as a result of your
presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is always an opportunity cost, and I don’t know any woman who feels
comfortable with all her decisions. As a result, we inadvertently hold that
discomfort against those who remind us of the path not taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Notes and Review - The Odyssey (Homer) (Wilson translation)</title>
   <link href="/2020/05/06/the-odyssey-review"/>
   <updated>2020-05-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/05/06/the-odyssey-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard about this new translation on the Ezra Klein show. Madeline Miller made
a very convincing pitch for why this book is relevant today, and why everyone
should read this book; especially, the new translation by Emily Wilson. I was
looking for something complex to read, that would keep me occupied for the 5 day
extended vacation from May 2nd to May 7th (here in Japan). That was my main
reason for picking this book up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story was simple, it was told at a beautiful, exciting clip. The story moves
forward with this incredible, hard-to-believe speed. I am glad I read this book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is fairly simple: Odysseus goes to Troy to fight alongside the Greeks
against the Trojans. He’s cunning, and &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; shady; he comes up with
several clever, “fox-like” plots throughout the story. Every time that he is
despairing and cornered somewhere, he comes up with some kind of way to trick
the person who has captured him and get out and get back to Ithaca, the place
where he was king before he left for Troy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, his wife Penelope and his son Telemachus are waiting for him. Well,
&lt;em&gt;sort-of&lt;/em&gt;. Telemachus is a child (although he is 20) and doesn’t really have
much of a spine. Penelope definitely wants him to return, but it also feels like
there are moments when she does not really want him to return. She’s never
really happy throughout the book; even when he comes back and they are
re-united, he tests him and then is happy that Odysseus is back; she is very
mysterious and does not clarify her position to anyone. And finally, the
villains of the story are the suitors: A group of obnoxious young men who are
trying to win Penelope’s hand in marriage. They have somehow entered Odysseus’
house and have started having daily feasts there (???) The concept of someone
entering your house just because you are not home and eating from your larder
and having a great time in your absense is hard to comprehend. Perhaps it was
something that was quite common in Ancient Greece? Exactly how they gained
access, and established themself in Odysseus’ house is never made clear. They
are there at the beginning of the book, and they are an obnoxious bunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odysseus is also &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; popular with the ladies. Every female character he meets
in the story immediately falls for him and wants to keep him tied up wherever
they live. Calypso is the goddess who has a lot of power and tries to take his
freedom and give him immortality instead; Odysseus is not down. Circe hangs out
with him for about a year; then he decides that he wants to leave. Why he didn’t
decide to leave early, if he really wanted to see his wife and son, is never
explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dichotomies&quot;&gt;Dichotomies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book has a lot of dichotomies. Odysseus wants to get back home, but he’s
always having a good time wherever he lands. He shows urgency at some points in
the story, but the 1 year he spends with Circe “in her bed” is pretty hard to
explain away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penelope wants her husband to come back home, she wants Telemachus to be safe
and to mature into an adult. She doesn’t take any steps towards either end. She
is very good at weaving apparently, so she is weaving in her room and weeping
into her bed. No concrete steps though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telemachus wants to become a man, but he’s the most spineless character in the
whole book. Every time that someone wants him to do something or decide
something, he simply defers to the other person. The most glaring example of
this that frustrated me was the one in which Odysseus has finally vanquished all
the suitors and asks him to suggest some kind of way to avoid a confrontation
with the suitors’ families. Telemachus replies promptly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Telemachus said warily, “You have to work it out. They say you have the
finest mind in all the world, no mortal man can rival you in cleverness”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odysseus was not fishing for compliments man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, the dichotomy when describing city sackers and pirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Strangers, who are you? Where did you sail from? Are you on business, or just
scouting round like pirates on the sea, who risk their lives to ravage foreign
homes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a pretty jarring line for me. “Risking your lives” is something that we
always associate with something noble: like joining the army or becoming a
doctor. “Ravaging foreign homes” is obviously very bad and not noble at all. To
put both of those in the same line and frame a question is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; hard to digest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;translation&quot;&gt;Translation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book isn’t very long. It’s written in “iambic pentameter” and you can
recognize the rhyme in most places, but it doesn’t read as a poem. It read likes
prose. It’s extremely fast-paced. That was the highlight for me. I was able to
finish reading this in about 3 days. I was reading slowly and taking notes and
making sure that I wasn’t missing anything important. Even still, the pace was
fast enough that I often ended up reading for 2 hours without noticing the time
or page numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found Madeline Miller’s pitch for the book on the Ezra Klein show podcast and
her &lt;a href=&quot;http://madelinemiller.com/the-odyssey-translated-by-emily-wilson/&quot;&gt;review of the book&lt;/a&gt; very useful to understand the goal behind this
translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the things that Homer has in the original is this incredible forward
motion. It’s an exciting, exciting read. Wilson wanted to keep that galloping
speed.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But of course, the English of the nineteenth or early twentieth century is no
closer to Homeric Greek than the language of today. The use of a noncolloquial
or archaizing linguistic register can blind readers to the real, inevitable,
and vast gap between the Greek original and any modern translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– From the translator’s note. Wilson gets it absolutely right! I have always
wondered why we must use antiquated English in our translations; she does a
great job of explaining why that’s not useful and serves only to drive people
away from reading literature that they would find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some really good portions in the poem. I really like the ones in which
the characters are talking about their hatred for one another, or how something
that the other character just said was so stupid that the person shouldn’t even
consider talking ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We suitors will keep eating up your wealth, and livelihood, as long as she
pursues this plan the gods have put inside her heart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– The impunity in this statement from Antinous (probably) is incredible. How
can you even say that, man!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Strangers, who are you? Where did you sail from? Are you on business, or just
scouting round like pirates on the sea, who risk their lives to ravage foreign
homes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do not be enraged at me, great goddess. You are quite right. I know my modest
wife Penelope could never match your beauty. She is a human; you are
deathless, ageless. But even so, I want to go back home, and every day I hope
that day will come. If some god strikes me on the wine-dark sea, I will endure
it. By now I am used to suffering – I have gone through so much, at sea and
in the war. Let this come too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As you know, divine Calypso held me in her cave, wanting to marry me; and
likewise Circe, the trickster, trapped me, and she wanted me to be her
husband. But she never swayed my heart, since when a man is far from home,
living abroad, there is no sweeter thing than his own native land and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– This line was an articulate description of how I have felt every time I have
moved away from a place I lived in for a long time. (moving to a new city when I
was 10, moving to college when I was 17, moving to Japan when I was 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So you must never treat your wife too well. Do not let her know everything you
know. Tell her some things, hide others. But your wife will not kill you,
Odysseus. The wise Penelope is much too sensible to do such things. Your bride
was very young when we went off to war. She had a baby still at her breats,
who must be now a man. he will be glad when you come home and see him, and he
will throw his arms around his father. That is how things should go. My wife
prevented my eager eyes from gazing at my son. She killed me first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– This is Agamemnon giving advise to Odysseus. It’s a strange thing to say; he
was burned pretty bad by his wife, but still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Scowling at him, Odysseus said, “Fool! I did not do you wrong or speak against
you. I am not jealous of another beggar receiving gifts, however much he
gets. This doorway can accommodate us both. Do not hog all the wealth; it is
not yours.20 You seem to be a homeless man, like me. Gods give all mortal
blessings. Do not stir me to fight or lose my temper. I am old but I will
crack your ribs and smash your face to bloody pulp—then I will have a day of
peace tomorrow; you will not return here to the palace of Odysseus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting words; “I will crack your ribs and smash your face to bloody pulp” =&amp;gt;
this is so much better than an action scene.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Notes and Review - A Game As Old As Empire (Hiatt)</title>
   <link href="/2020/04/19/empire-review"/>
   <updated>2020-04-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/04/19/empire-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is everything that it claims to be on the book jacket. It “uncovers
the inner workings of the institutions behind these economic manipulations”. In
particular, it looks at some of the &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; global institutions that are
name dropped in a lot of contexts: World Bank, International Monetary Fund and
the World Trade Organization. There are several stories here about loans that
were given to countries which were supposed to build schools or upgrade the city
hall building of a bustling city or one of a myriad of other reasons but never
did that or help the people the money was supposed to help in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit that it was a pretty shocking revelation at several points. In
particular, we get stories from the people in the field, the rank and file of
organizations like the World Bank who are going abroad to assess if a given loan
should be sanctioned or a banker who used to work in an island that was being
used for offshore banking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They tell stories about how their job affected the places that they were working
in or the places they went to in Africa (this book focuses a lot on some
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa) or about the ways in which the management and
people above them were basically apathetic to the consequences of the things
that their jobs were enabling. These stories are all backed up with actual data
from reports or news articles which show the outcomes of the things that are
discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly liked that the book doesn’t work as a list of testimonials where
the reader is simply supposed to believe the people who are telling the story
and the editor and not really question where they got their data. This was a
refreshing non-fiction book about global economics, in that sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learnt a lot of things about the global economy. The chapter on offshore
banking in Jersey, Englang, the chapter on exploitation of the Iraqi people and
government in the name of “Production Sharing Agreements”, the chapter about the
strange policies that were implemented in Philippines despite continued
realizations at different levels of the heirarchy that whatever they were doing
was simply not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important insights for me came in the 11th Chapter by James S. Henry,
The Mirage of Debt Relief. This chapter really shook me and my assumptions about
national debt. I didn’t know much about national debt before I started reading
the book, but my belief was that having high foreign debt was quite common in
most economies and that it wasn’t really something to think much about because
“banks and governments don’t default on loans”! This assumption of mine was
&lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; blown out of the water by the things that Henry shows in this
chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-the-debtcapital-flight-cycle&quot;&gt;On the Debt/Capital Flight cycle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt goes to the Finance ministry of a government with no oversight or
accountability to the tax payer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This capital is either wasted on projects that are intentionally priced above
the market rate or is fleeced by the people inside the government or
companies with close ties to people high up in the government who are
supposedly working on “development projects”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The fleeced capital is moved out of the country through a web of offshore
investments contributing to capital flight. This is powered by clever,
high priced lawyers and bankers who are working on islands like Jersey,
England (a previous chapter)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The country is left holding the bag: An unproductive loan that taxpayers have
to pay interest on as debt service, each year. The principal will almost
certainly not be paid for several years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence of this cycle might appear to be &lt;em&gt;semi-obvious&lt;/em&gt; if you have
followed the trajectory of some countries and their economies: They get huge
loans from the World Bank or from a group of foreign lenders, but the money
never ends up making any difference. Eventually, the country gets a follow-up
loan or everyone gives up on the country’s economy. &lt;em&gt;Corruption and transparency
issues&lt;/em&gt; are pegged as the root cause of this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the sitch: The debt-based development model doesn’t work when it comes to
low-middle income countries where the government is a weak institution and
almost always over-run by corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank model of neo-liberalism peddles the “free-market” as the silver
bullet which is going to solve all the problems that plague the lower income
economies of the world. But the problem with this model is that it is focused on
lending to the government, reducing the government’s role in the economy,
bringing in private players for local services and foreign investment for new
industries, effectively reducing the government to a license-issuing institution
with no real power to set policy or even the minimum wage that should be paid to
citizens or even control the amount of local labor that must be used for a given
project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In search of the free-market, the government has just accepted World Bank advise
and reduced it’s own role and made itself weaker. This makes it even more
simpler for corrupt individuals to take over the government and fleece future
and past loans even more efficiently! This kicks off the cycle which leads to a
small elite who control the government, are extremely rich, keep their assets
safely in First World economies in offshore investments, thus ensuring that
anyone that the loan was originally meant for will never benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;export-credit-agencies&quot;&gt;Export Credit Agencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of projects that were funded by ECAs from across the First World is
quite long and each project has it’s own problems. As the author of this chapter
(chapter 10), Bruce Rich, introduces a lot of issues with ECAs: Lack of
oversight, lack of accountability to the tax payer even though they can enjoy
the benefits of tax money and the government’s clout, an impenetrable curtain of
secrecy that ensures that they don’t &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; have to publish the list of projects
that they approved and funded! The author uses a phrase that can be used in
several situations including while describing the development that was supposed
to come from the huge loans that have been sanctioned over the past few years to
the lower income countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;perpetually around the corner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some important numbers and a little bit of discussion about why China,
India and Korea had some structural, geographical and political advantages and
thus were able to mostly ignore advise from the IMF and outright reject the
neo-liberalism that is being peddled as the “road to development”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not find anything problematic about the book. The sources are extensive
and most of the facts that are not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; personal experiences are backed up
with official sources. My reading list after reading this book has a couple of
papers about ECAs and how economists in the First World view them. The one thing
that might threw me at first was how old all the data was. Reading the
introduction gives some background on this, it appears as if this book has been
around for a while but wasn’t published by anyone because no one wanted to touch
a book that was flaty critical about the &lt;em&gt;global economic system&lt;/em&gt; and what had
basically become a cartel of the richest countries bending loans and lower
income countries to their will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China and India alone account for about $500 billion of this developing
country “present value debt.” Both countries have been careful about foreign
borrowing, and they have also largely ignored IMF / World Bank policy
advice. The result is that their foreign debt burdens are small relative to
national income. Both countries – partly because they refuse the follow
orthodox neoliberal policies – now have high growth economies and large
stockpiles of foreign reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.222&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The fundamental problem, glossed over by some debt-relief campaigners and
conventional “end poverty now” economists, is that comabting poverty is not
just a question of providing malaria nets, vaccinces, and drinking water, or
incremental increases in education, capital, technology and aid. Ultimately,
as China’s example shows, long-term poverty reductions requires the promotion
of deep-seated structural change. This implies the redistribution of social
assets like land, education, technology, and political power. These are
concepts that BWI [Bretton Woods Institutions] technocrats may never
understand – or may recoil from in horro. But they are the root of every
major development success story that we know.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Notes and Review - Sapiens (Harari)</title>
   <link href="/2020/04/12/sapiens-review"/>
   <updated>2020-04-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/04/12/sapiens-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been hearing about Sapiens since April 2018. A friend in university read
that book and told me that it was really good and that it changed the way they
thought about a lot of things. I wanted to read the book but it was never very
high on my list. This past Friday, I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/17/yuval-noah-harari-gives-the-really-big-picture&quot;&gt;a profile of the author&lt;/a&gt;, Yuval Noah
Harari in the New Yorker. This profile intrigued me because it told the story of
a university professor and a historian and even a philosopher who had some very
strange principles and said things that I had honestly never heard before. These
two quotes sealed the deal for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In “Sapiens,” Harari writes in detail about a meeting in the desert between
Apollo 11 astronauts and a Native American who dictated a message for them to
take to the moon. The message, when later translated, was “They have come to
steal your lands.” Harari’s text acknowledges that the story might be a
“legend.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know if it’s a true story,” Harari told me. “It doesn’t matter–it’s
a good story.” He rethought this. “It matters how you present it to the
readers. I think I took care to make sure that at least intelligent readers
will understand that it maybe didn’t happen.” (The story has been traced to a
Johnny Carson monologue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to find out if I was an &lt;em&gt;intelligent reader&lt;/em&gt;. And this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Later this year, in Israel, Harari plans to have a private conversation with
Peterson. Harari said of Peterson’s representatives, “They offered to do a
public debate. And we said that we don’t want to, because there is a danger
that it will just be mud wrestling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know much about Jordan Peterson but I have seen him talk about some
things when he was on the H3H3 podcast and the one feeling I didn’t get from him
was that he was someone who would get into mud wrestling on a public debate.
(Especially because they talk about his appearance on an English talk show and
how the anchor tries to &lt;em&gt;gotcha&lt;/em&gt; him every single time but he is extremely
careful with his words and can effortlessly trace back to exactly what he said,
word for word, and explain to her why she is portraying things not as they are,
but as she wants them to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I &lt;em&gt;absolutely had&lt;/em&gt; to drop everything else and read Sapiens. I did just
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into three parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t read Sapiens. Read Lever of Riches (Mokyr) to get a detailed
account of the last 2000 years of technological progress and Factfulness
(Rosling) to learn about the social advancements that we have made since ancient
times and feel good about progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren’t a lot of original insights in this book, there’s a lot of
speculation without any backing in facts or in arguments. The prose isn’t
concrete enough to be history and isn’t abstract or argumentative enough to be
philosophy. It is extremely easy to read and that is concerning to me because of
the purported subject of the book: “History of Humankind”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people who read this review might disagree with me or might think that this
review is too harsh. I am confounded by the fact that so many people read this
book and found it to be useful. I want to understand how that could happen.
Perhaps, we can discuss why you thought it was a good book and what insights
were in it that I didn’t pick up on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-1&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part covers human “history” leading upto about 12,000 years ago. The
main event that it talks about is the Cognitive revolution about 70,000 years
ago at which point in time there were several species of the genus &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; on the
planet and the &lt;em&gt;sapiens&lt;/em&gt; species was the first to start thinking. I have put the
word history in quotation marks because most of it is made up. There are no
written records (there wasn’t even writing yet) and there’s the flimsiest basis
for most of the claims made in this part if you consider archaelogical findings.
    The ethos of this part seems to be “If you don’t know what happened, make
    something up”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particular passage sums up this part nicely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark. In modern times, a small difference in
skin color, dialect, or religion has been enough to prompt one group of
Sapiens to set about exterminating another group. Would Ancient Sapiens have
been any more tolerant towards an entirely different human species?  It may
well be that when Sapiens encountered Neanderthals, the result was the first
and most significant ethnic-cleansing campaign in history.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passage comes about 3 lines after the author admits that there are two
possibilites that expert have admitted: Sapiens exterminated Neanderthals either
intentionally or by simply being better at foraging and hunting everything before
Neanderthals could do anything OR Sapiens and Neanderthals intermixed and there
was no malicious extermination. You might have seen what path the author chose.
And perhaps you see why he chose that path. This passage is particularly hard to
look past because it’s the equivalent of something that talking heads say on TV
to get next day’s sound bite; it is sensational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 1 is rife with such examples. Another classic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us. Domesticate comes from the
Latin &lt;em&gt;domus&lt;/em&gt;, which means “house”. Who’s the one living in a house? Not the
wheat. It’s the Sapiens.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.81&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one last one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since we enjoy affluence and security, and since our affluence and security
are built on foundations laid by the Agricultural Revolution, we assume that
the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful improvement.  Yet it is wrong to
judge thousands of years of history from the perspective of today.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.83&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: what he is talking about is not wrong. No one can say that it
is, because we &lt;em&gt;don’t know&lt;/em&gt; what is right. We have absolutely no idea. No one
does because there are no records from this period of time. As there are no
records, one can say almost anything they want to about this period without
caussing much ire among any group of scholars. In my opinion, one should not
speculate about such things. Especially when the speculation is that it was a
tragic mis-step to move from foraging to agriculture and the implication is that
even though we have some comforts today the path we took to this state was not a
good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that books about a particular philosophy make such speculations. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt;
is completely acceptable as the author is trying to put forward an argument for
why things are the way they are. This is not philosophy. This book is not being
marketed as philosophy. The back cover of the book claims that it is related to
“Science” and nowhere does it indicate that everything in this book might not be
factual or even based on any evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-2&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the smallest part of the book. It talks about the effects of the
Agricultural Revolution, about 12,000 years ago. Here, we slowly lead up to the
invention of writing. Things start to get more concrete and the author moves
away from using &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;perhaps&lt;/em&gt;. There are fewer over-simplifications
in this part, but there is still a significant amount of “dumbing down” of
complicated topics for the benefit of the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t really get any novel insights from this part either. Most of the stuff
being said is either mundane and known to everyone or hyperbole. I have tried to
find some original insight that I can highlight here but I am struggling to even
as I flip through the chapters to find something. This is a very good example of
the kind of hyperbole: The author’s argument is that moving from foraging to
agriculture was a tragic mis-step, people are supposedly working more hours,
dependent on nature’s whims hence making them more anxious and are getting less
nutrituous food in return. The only good point is that the food comes in
abundance and one doesn’t have to live hand-to-mouth which leads to an explosion
in population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When discussing why such a mis-step was allowed to stand by thinking populations
and evolution, on a macro level, alike, here’s what is said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The above scenario explains the Agricultural Revolution as a mis-calculation.
It’s very plausible. History is full for far more idiotic mis-calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.89&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no explanation about what those other &lt;em&gt;idiotic mis-calculations&lt;/em&gt; were;
also, the very next paragraph explains another possibility which has written
evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-3&quot;&gt;Part 3&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the longest part and it’s about the unification of humanity into a
single world. For the first time in the book, there are some original insights.
Even though they are framed as bite-sized couplets that would look very good
with a contemplative image as background, they are insights nonetheless. here’s
the first one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/sapiens-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;sapiens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/c-qqleQ8REk&quot;&gt;Photo by Christian Kielberg on Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have time to make similar images for the other insights, but there are
some good ones. One particular story that I liked was about how James Cook’s
expedition out to Australia was actually as part of an expedition that the
British government had set up asking scientists to go to different places and
get some readings which would enable them to calculate the distance between the
Earth and the Sun accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one was about how America was named after Amerigo even though the only
thing the Italian Amerigo did was say that the landmass that Columbus found were
part of an entirely unknown continent. This is a great piece of trivia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more such pieces of trivia. But the major questions are left
unanswered and there aren’t even any solid serious arguments put forth about
them. For eg, the author started to make me uncomfortable for a few paragraphs
by saying that Communism and even Nazism were religions!!! They were not mere
ideologies that one could choose to believe at one point and not believe when
they did not feel like it, they were religions that one must convert to and
can’t leave without an official conversion, and so on. But after these few
paragraphs, he immediately backs off and doesn’t flesh it out any further. I
don’t think I would have the stomach to read about how Nazism is a religion (I
recently finished reading Diary of a Man in Despair) but for Communism, it would
have been an interesting argument to reason about. But the book disappoints by
not taking it any further. In fact, the author even says that it’s not of any
import what you call it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If it makes you feel better, you can go on calling Communism an ideology and
rather than a religion. It makes no difference.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.229&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this was indeed the case, then why make the initial argument and say that
they are religions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question that is asked is about why the Chinese or the Mughals or the
Indians weren’t interested in going over to America and conquering those lands
for themselves despite finding out about European conquests on this new
    continent almost immediately and having the ocean navigation technology to
    get there. Readers of this blog might notice that this is extremely similar
    to the questions posed by Mokyr in Lever of Riches. The difference being
    that Mokyr presents the comparison in extreme detail and puts forth several
    arguments for why he thinks this could have been. Nothing of this sort can
    be found in Sapiens. The question is posed, and promptly forgotten about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last three chapters of the book are apart on their own. The book slowly
turns into a social commentary on our connected way of life, consumerism, people
buying things they don’t need, happiness being connected to what one feels
rather than what one has, “pauper can be happy if they have a loving family but a
lonely billionair can’t” and so on. Once again, there’s nothing particularly
revolutionary about anything being said. I felt like I was reading curated
Medium articles about capitalism, happiness, consumerism, the evils of shopping
malls, global trade connecting nations etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some hard to believe assertions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Never before has peace been so prevalent that people could not even imagine
war&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.344&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author says this in reference to the post-WW2 period from 1945 to now. As
far as I can remember, most of the cold war was anxiety filled about an actual
war, there was an actual war in Vietnam, then several wars in the middle east.
In India and across the world, there was some terrible terrorism in the period
between 2000-2012. So, I would say that “people could not even imagine war” is
an exaggeration. There’s also no mention about the most peaceful period in
history which one might compare our own times against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-quotes-from-the-book&quot;&gt;Some quotes from the book&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of sentences that start with probably and how detailed they can be:
(emphasis on probably mine)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nomadic bands that stalked wild sheep gradualy altered the constitutions of
the herds on which they preyed.  &lt;em&gt;This process probably&lt;/em&gt; began with selevive
hunting. Humans learnt that it was to their advantage to hunt only adult rams
and old or sick sheep. They spared fertile females and young lambs in order to
safeguard the long term vitality of the local herd. The second step might have
been to actively defend the herd againt predators. Driving away lions, wolves
and rival human bands. The band might next have coralled the herd into a
narrow gorge, in order to better control and defend it. Finally, people began
to make a more careful selection among the sheep, in order to tailer them to
human needs. The most aggresive rams, the ones that showed the greatest
resistance to human control, were slaughtered first. So were the skinniest
females and the most curious. With each passing generation, the sheep became
fatter more submissive and less curious. &lt;em&gt;Voila!&lt;/em&gt; Mary had a little lamb and
everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.92&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of the arguments that the author decided to back out of instead of
fleshing them out further:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If it makes you feel better, you can go on calling Communism an ideology and
rather than a religion. It makes no difference.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.229&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crucial lack of explanation about what the theories are and why they aren’t
convincinng:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why did the Scientific Revolution begin there of all places, and not in China
or India? Why did it begin at the midpoint of the second millenium rather than
2 centuries before or 3 centuries later? We don’t know. Scholars have proposed
dozens of theories but none of them is convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– p.244&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For posterity, the arguments given in Lever of Riches (Mokyr) &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; convincing.
The least the author could do was at least point the reader to another book
which would summarize those theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. I wrote about this on Twitter as I was reading the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/1248560823628214272&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2020-04-10-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Converting GNUCash's XML file to Ledger's DAT format</title>
   <link href="/2020/04/05/gnucash-ledger-conversion"/>
   <updated>2020-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/04/05/gnucash-ledger-conversion</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; What follows is a meandering account of why I wrote a Perl script to
convert GNUCash’s XML file to Ledger’s plaintext format. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/gnucash-xml-to-ledger-dat&quot;&gt;This script&lt;/a&gt; was the
result of this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using GNUCash to maintain my personal finances for about 4 years
now, and especially since I started working, I have used a single GNUCash book
for my expenses. Before that, I used to close my accounts every year or half
    year and start a new book. Apparently, this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the recommended way to
    use GNUCash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I have used GNUCash, the more I have become familiar with the data
entry system. In general, I try to enter all my transactions by saving receipts
and categorizing everything appropriately. If ever I have the feeling that a
particular month or quarter I spent too much on a given category (bought too
many clothes / too much electronics shopping) I pull up the Expense barchart
report that GNUCash has in built support for. The default report is pretty good,
and gives one a good idea of how they are doing with their money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ideal-flow&quot;&gt;The Ideal Flow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ledger-cli.org/&quot;&gt;Ledger&lt;/a&gt; came across my radar when I was researching for alternative tools that
automate the entry process. In particular, the flow I had in mind was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right after the transaction, enter the transaction in my phone into a note or
send an email to myself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some cronjob takes these emails and converts them into a file that GNUCash
can parse&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Import this file into GNUCash at the end of each week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might have been too ambitious, because I couldn’t find one easy to import
format for GNUCash. I wanted some convenience features too. The major one was
“Transaction Aliases”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CC F L RA 500&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; Lunch at Restaurant A, 500 Yen,
                =&amp;gt; Debit from credit card, Credit to Expenses:Food:Lunch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was definitely not part of the MVP that I was envisioning, but I wanted to
be able to build this at some point in time. I even dreamed up a fictional DML
that would support both aliased transactions &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; new transactions. I am sad to
say though that none of this ever became reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;well-what-did-become-reality-then&quot;&gt;Well, what did become reality then?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A script that converts the GNUCash’s XML formatted file into the file format
that Ledger accepts as input. (A text file which commonly has the extension
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.dat&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ledger is a very interesting project. It attempts to be a complete accounting
and finance monitoring tool (which can be used even by enterprises which have
complex transactions) that’s based completely on a single text file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a DML that defines transactions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are no database type “IDs” that are attached to accounts or commodities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every time you run Ledger, the whole file is parsed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ledger doesn’t control the data entry. That is, you can enter data however you
wish. You can export data from GNUCash to Ledger, or from a spreadsheet to
Ledger, or write the Ledger entries by hand (very painful) or generate it from
other structured format using a script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Ledger cares about is that &lt;strong&gt;your DAT file should have a bunch of
transactions, and these transactions must balance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if the DAT file has a set of transactions and they balance, then Ledger can
generate a variety of reports for you. This is where things get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A little bit of accounting knowledge from a complete beginner) There are three
accounting reports that you will find on every single company’s quarterly
earnings reports. Apparently, these reports are big deals and tell everything
one needs to know about the “financials” of a company. I don’t know much about
why or how to read one and learn new information. I did want to generate these
three for my own personal finances though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ledger lets you do this extremely easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hledger &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; simple.dat balancesheet
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prints a plaintext balancesheet. It lists all the assets that you have
(bank balances, cash, stocks) and all your liabilities (credit card outstanding,
loans). I found my balancesheet to be rather interesting. I didn’t learn
anything particularly new, but it was a fun project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-perl-though&quot;&gt;Why Perl though?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perl has a pretty good XML parsing library. I have also read a bunch of blog
posts that say that Perl is the best language for massaging text and moving it
from one format to another format. I wanted to use Perl for a real world project
and see what advantages it had and whether I would be able to really use it on a
daily basis without having to look at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;perldoc&lt;/code&gt; every 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did’t really get too far with my actual Perl expertise, but I did learn a few
great things about Perl itself. Such as the difference between scalars, arrays,
hashes and references. And how Perl understands what context a variable is used
in (i.e an array’s length is used if you compare it against 0 inside an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;
clause)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion though, I wanted to try a new scripting language and this seemed
as good a project as any other out there.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;2019-03-21T14:47:12Z&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that I have been building a lot of tools lately. In particular, I
have gotten into writing Vim plugins and forking and editing the tools I use
often so that they have the options I want, but will probably never be merged
into the tool’s repository itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generated this list by making a request to the Github API:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;curl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-G&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--data-urlencode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;sort=newest&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;https://api.github.com/users/icyflame/repos&quot;&lt;/span&gt; |&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
        jq &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;.[] | [ .name, .created_at ] | @tsv&apos;&lt;/span&gt; |&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
        tsv-pretty
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been working on a lot of open source stuff lately, but can’t figure
out what exactly it is you spend most of your time doing, I definitely recommend
looking through Github’s API!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vim-plugins&quot;&gt;Vim Plugins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a Vim user for a few years now and I have written extensively about
it! The one thing I hadn’t done before was write plugins. So, I started looking
into writing a plugin with the specific goal of writing a plugin that would
store the currently open buffer in a file somewhere on my file-system. Where the
file was stored wasn’t really important, it didn’t even matter what the name of
the file was, all the mattered was that it was on my persistent storage
somewhere. If I knew that the file was stored, it would allow me to get text
(like deployment pipelines), store them on my file-system and go ahead and edit
them directly without having to think about where I should store it or what I
should name them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Vim’s plugin API is extremely easy to use. There are two
particular things about it that I like a lot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standardized file-structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;tree &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--charset&lt;/span&gt; ascii
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
|-- autoload
|   &lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; persistent_scratch.vim
|-- LICENSE
|-- plugin
|   &lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; persistent_scratch.vim
&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; README.md

2 directories, 4 files
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Vim plugins are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; similar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;autoload/plugin.vim&lt;/code&gt; file with all the keybindings and calls out to the
functions which implement the plugin’s functionality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plugin/plugin.vim&lt;/code&gt; file with the plugin’s functionality and some exposed
functions which can be called by the keybindings / commands defined in the
autoload file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple file structure makes it very simple to write a new plugin by looking
at an existing plugin and trying to do the same things but for your use-case. My
plugin reference was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mtth/scratch.vim&quot;&gt;mtth/scratch.vim&lt;/a&gt;. My plugin was very similar to that
plugin except for the part where the file is being stored on persistent storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy to test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VimScript is an interpreted language (I think?) and one can test plugins by
simply symlinking the plugin’s development directory to a directory inside
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.vim/bundle&lt;/code&gt;. After doing that, you only have to open Vim and start testing
your commands / keybindings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After PersistentScratch, I migrated MarkdownLinks out from my Vimrc out to it’s
own plugin. MarkdownLinks is a plugin which adds a hyperlink to the word that
your cursor is on or the highlighted text and adds the template &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[&lt;/code&gt; around the
word and the declaration of the link at the end of the file. I was surprised
that something like this doesn’t already exist. I wonder how other Markdown
writers deal with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I actually started using Neovim instead of Vim recently. More on this
in another blog post. &lt;em&gt;Hint:&lt;/em&gt; The reasons were mostly because of my
disillusionment with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life&quot;&gt;BDFL&lt;/a&gt; model of governance in open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bash-functions--utilities&quot;&gt;Bash functions + Utilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;json-where is something that I have been working on for a while now. It has been
extremely useful to me whenever I am reading Kubernetes manifests. (Kubernetes
manifests are notorious for containing extremely nested keys with vital
information) It tells you the key given a location inside a JSON buffer. This
works perfectly from inside Vim, where you can simply run a keybinding and get
the path to the key your cursor is on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gospec is the other thing that I have recently spent some time on. It’s a
prettifier for the output produced by the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;go test&lt;/code&gt; command. I have been using
it daily at work and it has reduced the time I spend using cumbersome tools
(like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ag&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sort -r&lt;/code&gt;) when debugging tests for new code. It doesn’t do
anything very complicated and the function itself fits within 100 lines of bash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;misc&quot;&gt;Misc&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been writing some Perl recently. Perl is a surprising language as it has
been around for a long time and it has remained mostly unchanged. The text
handling capacities of bash are limited, and I use Gawk whenever I have to
change streams of text, but sometimes even Gawk is not upto the task, especially
when JSON is in the mix. One recent example was when I wanted to list all the
Kubernetes pods and output the namespaces which had a particular environment
variable set to a given value. I ended up writing a NodeJS script for this, but
I definitely wished for something faster in the moment and I have been wondering
if Perl could have been that language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perl’s is able to deal with HTTP requests, XML (some APIs are still XML), and
JSON effortlessly. I want to start including it more in my daily scripting
tasks. Something that I started using just yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;https://vendor.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt; | perl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-MURI&lt;/span&gt;::Escape &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;print uri_escape(&amp;lt;&amp;gt;)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2 times I had to URL escape some text, I loaded up JSBin.com and entered
it into the console. It took me a couple minutes to find the JS function which
escapes text. So, yeah, this approach is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; faster.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2020-02-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/02/29/a-work-from-home</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mercari &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.mercari.com/press/news/article/20200218_coronavirus/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on 18th February, 2020 that they will be implementing a
work from home polcy for all employees starting the next day and continuing till
the end of February. This past week the policy was extended one more week, until
March 8th. More extensions are possibly around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I have been working from home since 19th February! I have a desk and a
monitor at home. I brought my split keyboard (A Kinesis Freestyle 2) back home
from the office. Setup-wise, I would say I have managed to re-create a very
work-like environment. My house is a typical apartment in Tokyo with a floor
space of 25 square meters (about 250 sq. feet). There’s a living space of about
150 sq.m and the rest is a kitchen, a bathroom and space for a refrigerator and
a washing machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work from home has been going fairly well, I believe. I was working on a project
with about 4 other engineers. Understandably, communication has gotten slightly
harder because we don’t sit 3 feet from each other 8 hours every day but
fundamentally, we have a good idea of what we need to do and how everyone else
is progressing with what they are doing. Often times when working on a big
project that has several components with different people working on each
component, there’s a lack of clarity about which piece is being built and how
the pieces are dependent on each other. For backend development, this is perhaps
even more of a problem because the way we break things down is generally by the
various stages in a user’s usage of the project (the so-called &lt;em&gt;user story&lt;/em&gt;)
rather than the actual parts of the various repositories one would be changing.
Most of the time, these things actually match up fairly easily and there’s no
conflicts / wasted time because two people ended up writing the same code and
one person happened to be done first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another part of the development process which I expected to take a hit from not
working in an office was code review. This, I am happy to say, I have been wrong
about. Code reviews have been coming in at the same pace, and there might even
have been a slight decrease in the time between consecutive rounds of review
because everyone is keeping fairly strict hours. While working at the office
(with the privilege of having flexible hours) there were only a few hours of the
day when everyone was at work at the same time and one could go through several
cycles of review pretty quickly, while also addressing all the feedback that the
reviewer had in the previous cycle. &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/speed.html&quot;&gt;This guide&lt;/a&gt; on why code reviews should be
done within a full working day has been very useful. It’s a pleasure working
with developers who have read this / follow the advice in this instinctively.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Year in Review - 2019</title>
   <link href="/2020/02/02/2019-in-review"/>
   <updated>2020-02-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/02/02/2019-in-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2019! It was my first full year at work, first full year outside India, the
first time I spent a considerable amount of time learning and conversing in a
foreign language. I looked back on the things I did and experienced in 2019 and
wrote down the ones that stood out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;travel&quot;&gt;Travel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Europe for the first time! It was also the first time I travelled
outside India with my parents. We spent about a week in Italy! We went to
Vatican City and stood in the plaza in front of St. Peter’s Basilica. I enjoyed
the food and coffee that is especially in abundance in Italy, the amazing nature
around Lake Como and the clean, crisp mid-August air.  I also realized that most
of the paintings in Rome were about war, strife, hunger and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also went snowboarding for the first time. It was a back-breaking experience,
I look forward to going once every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I visited Hiroshima and that was a very good trip. It’s a small city and so much
of it is built around the A-Bomb from 74 years ago. It was an essential
experience for me, to see the devastation that the bomb caused, to hear about
the people it affected and to be in the city that I had read about all my life,
without quite internalizing the impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note to self:&lt;/strong&gt; Arrive around noon, instead of after 8 pm at the country’s
airport. Bring an empty water bottle and buy 2L bottles from a grocery store.
Set a day aside to go to the various restaurants in whichever city you are
staying in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;books-and-podcasts&quot;&gt;Books and Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/14601568&quot;&gt;did not&lt;/a&gt; get to my goal of 25 books in 2019. I did read some very good
books though. The highlights for me were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stranger in a Strange Land (Heinlein)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eichmann in Jerusalem (Arendt)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Box (Levinson)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Lever of Riches (Mokyr)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that I really like non-fiction written by economists. So, I am going
to be reading more of that in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the podcast front, I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; got into podcasts this year! I heard The Daily
everyday, the whole year and there were some amazing episodes and series.
Looking through the list of episodes on PocketCasts, I see some starred
episodes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Jungle Prince series&lt;/strong&gt; - November&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Origins of Boeing’s 737 Max Crisis&lt;/strong&gt; - July - I heard this right before
getting on a 14 hour flight to Munich. The management style’s direct impact on
the factory floor was surprising when you hear about it from someone in middle
management.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The President and the Publisher&lt;/strong&gt; - February - “He just wanted his home
town’s newspaper to do a good story about him” - Maybe it was an act, maybe it
was real. Either way, the vulnerability and the detail with which this episode
detailed Trump’s interview with NYT’s publisher and journalists was good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;music&quot;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2019-spotify-playlists.png&quot; alt=&quot;spotify&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started using Spotify Premium. I don’t say this lightly, it has been the best
decision ever. The catalogue is un-ending, I have found some incredible music
through Spotify’s recommendations. The best artists I discovered last year were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suzanne Vega&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cass McCombs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Elliot Smith&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Metronomy (co-worker played The Bay at a work mixer!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jack White&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also saw Metronomy perform live in Shibuya. I went to a bunch of classical
piano recitals at the Sumida Triphony Hall. &lt;strong&gt;And&lt;/strong&gt; I saw Max Richter perform
Memoryhouse and Blue Notebooks live!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Visit the Ironbound market in Pennsylvania and Torbay in Devon,
England. Use the Spotify API to backup the monthly playlists in a spreadsheet
and store that in Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tv-and-movies&quot;&gt;TV and Movies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At long last, I got into The Office (US) and started watching it. I like the
first four seasons, I am still ambivalent about the later seasons. I watched
several episodes of Seinfeld and Modern Family repeatedly. Seinfeld still
remains at the top of my list for comfort-TV!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrace_House_(franchise)&quot;&gt;Terrace House&lt;/a&gt; and watched all it’s existing seasons. It is a
unique kind of unscripted show and probably one of the most useful resources in
my efforts to learn Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t watch as many new movies as I would have liked to. Coffee in Berlin
(2014) was a really good movie that I watched randomly on a flight. I can’t
think of any other movie that I watched for the first time in 2019. A dismal
showing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across and started using a lot of stuff. The changes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/dotfiles/compare/master@%7B2019-01-01%7D...master@%7B2019-12-31%7D&quot;&gt;my dotfiles&lt;/a&gt;
over the year are especially indicative of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Started using prezto instead of zsh&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrote the command prompt in prezto so that it would be exactly like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ys&lt;/code&gt; in
zsh. This took me a good 3 hours, but I think it was perhaps the best use of
my time! I know exactly how to change every single character in the prompt
now!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configured Vim to work as I expected and wanted it to. I started using
Slimux and UltiSnips among a lot of other plugins which were especially useful
at work. I wrote my first Vim function and Vim plugin and realized the
opportunities that I had to customize it further&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customized the statusline for Vim and Tmux. Tmux bindings to resize by
entering the width and height&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-mapped &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CAPS&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ESC&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; This was a co-worker’s recommendation and it has
been a game changer for me. My hands move less and it’s incredibly convenient
because I never used the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CAPS&lt;/code&gt; key before. On the flip side, I have gotten
much slower at using someone else’s computer when they don’t have this
mapping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the configuration changes, I wrote a lot of bash and subsequently, I
am actually okay at it now. I don’t have to look at the Bash Comparison
operators and Bash if-else operators help page as often as I used to. I got
slghtly better at awk and sed, but my proficiency in those hasn’t increased
substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work&quot;&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 was my first full year at work. I learned several new things about
organizations and how they work. I learnt more about Search and Golang. I
reviewed a lot of code and would like to think that I got better at reviewing
and getting reviews, but that’s questionable at best. I got used to the
development process at work and I got used to my role in it. I have only been at
work a year now, so I can’t really say I gained a lot of insights about anything
in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get much better at explaining complex concepts to people in the same
room and people halfway across the world by sharing my screens and preparing UML
diagrams. I started writing basic PlantUML without looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plantuml-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/diagrams/sequence.html&quot;&gt;PlantUML
examples&lt;/a&gt; webpage. Still a long way to go though, my diagrams often miss
boxes because I don’t know how to make them off the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, I got better at taking notes that will stay with me forever. I have
a simple system of one file per month, I keep writing things in that file and
keep everything in the same folder. Using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ag&lt;/code&gt;, I can search for anything no
matter when I wrote it and this has been helpful especially when I want to find
out the reason for some of my choices, a few months down the line. I am writing
everything in Markdown (including this post) and I am looking forward to
building more tools around my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Notes and Review - The Trial (Kafka)</title>
   <link href="/2020/01/18/the-trial-review"/>
   <updated>2020-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/01/18/the-trial-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The text cannot be altered, and the various opinions are often no more than an
expression of despair over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This text perfectly describes this book. But the author put it at around the 90%
mark, right when the book is about to end and you are starting to understand the
kind of closure you will get from this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as disorienting books go, I have found those with non-linear timelines to
be the most disorienting. In particular, you don’t know what’s going on, you
have completely lost your place in the story of the book, you are invested in
seeing the main character get out of whatever jam they are in but you have
absolutely no clue where to go or which way will take the character forward and
which will simply be a regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trial started (for me) with all of these confusions. K. was arrested, but he
could keep working. The men who came to his house to tell him he was arrested
were strange and didn’t behave as powerful men would have, K. is extremely
apologetic to his neighbours and does some strange stuff: visiting a female
neighbour at around 11 pm and so on. He is annoyed and confused, just as I was
annoyed and confused at the author’s disinterest in telling me what was going
on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feeling never quite goes away, throughout the book. At every step, you
think this new character is probably not going to be very important, and they
are not, but you get a lot of exposition about them and if it’s a female
character, they are immediately taken by K.’s looks and fall in love with him.
The author even addresses this himself while talking about how all the accused
were attractive in one way or another:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;this peculiarity of hers consists in this; Leni finds most of the accused
attractive. She attaches herself to each of them, loves each of them, even
seems to be loved by each of them; then she sometimes entertains me by telling
me about them when I allow her to. I am not so astonished by all of this as
you seem to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that Kafka does a disturbingly good job at is showing government
offices, the people working in them and the way proceedings are handled. I had
to visit the Regional Passport Office in Kolkata, India once. And the first trip
that K. takes on a Sunday to the &lt;em&gt;court&lt;/em&gt; sounded eerily famiiar because it was
on a similar errand: I had no idea why I didn’t have my passport yet, I had to
wait in line from about 10 am to 2 pm, there were a lot of people around me, the
clerks in the office were the king-makers that day, the inability to see any of
the &lt;em&gt;senior officers&lt;/em&gt; in the office who would certainly understand my situation
and finally, the breathlessness when you are just inside the door and are not
yet used to the universal lack of ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As a result, the accused and his defence don’t have access even to the court
records, and especially not to the indictment, and that means we generally
don’t know - or at least not precisely - what the first documents need to be
about, which means that if they do contain anything of relevance to the case
it’s only by a lucky coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; The second-last chapter in the cathedral leading up to the ending is
weird. It has an anecdote about a doorman and it sounds vaguely similar to K.’s
story and experience with the court, but not really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-quotes&quot;&gt;Some quotes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;he admits he doesn’t know the law and at the same time insists he’s innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– When stated as literally as that, it seems rather stupid to ever say that one
is innocent or that someone else is guilty because no one knows the law. When we
say we’re innocent, I think we tend to use our value judgement of right and
wrong and try to decide what we would classify what we did as; thinking about
innocence as something determined by one’s value system and not by the written
word of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He had, of course, begun work straight away and was nearly ready to submit the
first documents. They would be very important because the first impression
made by the defence will often determine the whole course of the proceedings.
Unfortunately, though, he would still have to make it clear to K. that the
first documents submitted are sometimes not even read by the court. They
simply put them with the other documents and point out that, for the time
being, questioning and observing the accused are much more important than
anything written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Catch-22 style contradiction! LOVE IT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As a result, the accused and his defence don’t have access even to the court
records, and especially not to the indictment, and that means we generally
don’t know - or at least not precisely - what the first documents need to be
about, which means that if they do contain anything of relevance to the case
it’s only by a lucky coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“After a certain point in the proceedings,” said the lawyer quietly and
calmly, “nothing new of any importance ever happens. So many litigants, at
the same stage in their trials, have stood before me just like you are now and
spoken in the same way.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Notes and Review - The Lever of Riches (Mokyr)</title>
   <link href="/2020/01/01/lever-of-riches-review"/>
   <updated>2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2020/01/01/lever-of-riches-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lever of Riches is a great book. I think I say that about a lot of books
though. Lever of Riches is a 3-part book. In the first part, Mokyr presents a
concise history of Technological progress starting in 500 BC and ending around
\1915. In the second part, Mokyr compares the relative technological progress in
three periods across time and space and the possible reasons (he touches on
religion, culture, geography and national sentiment as possible reasons). In the
last part, he draws an analogy between Biological Evolution and Technological
progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the first and second parts immensely. I didn’t find the last part (the
analogy) very intersting or useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the notes I made as I was reading this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-1&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Water wheels are very important!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compass - 1300 - A single self-contained unit; this made year-round navigation
possible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Printing Press - Gutenberg - 1453 - In the 50 years following this invention,
more books were produced as compared to the preceding 1000 years.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The educated class and the working class must interact closely and regularly.
People in the educated class have the potential and opportunity to innovate
and create new solutions whereas only people in the working class know what
problems exist. If there is a disconnect between these two groups of people
(as in Ancient Societies where children were educated and kept far from all
 proagmatic matters) innovation suffers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double Entry Book-keeping - 1350&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Steam Engine - 1712 - 4.5% efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In conjunction with other inventions, power technology created the gap between
Europe and the rest of the world, a temporary dis-equilibrium that allowed the
Europeans to establish global political and military domination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Electric generator - 1870 - Stable, continuous current without over-heating&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Progress in communication - Early 1800s, London -&amp;gt; Calcutta -&amp;gt; London postage
might take as long as 2 years. 1914 -&amp;gt; Less than 2 weeks!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bicycle - 1885 - The first means of transportation that was cheap and truly
personal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Typewriter - 1874 - The Remington Company buys the patent for the typewriter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automobile - 1876 - Otto creates the 4-stroke engine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Radio - 1906&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Technological growth seems to be the only avenue of sustained growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-2&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every invention has private and societal costs - Are both parties willing to
bear this cost?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inventors must be willing to bear risk to change the status quo. A lot of
factors that inventors struggle with are permissive rather than causal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technological progress is path dependent - Progress begets Progress
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Societies that accidentally bet on the slower horse might not realize how
much potential other players in the race had! They might drop an idea
simply because the first iteration they chose was incorrect
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Camels in Middle East - 500 BC - This precluded the building of roads,
but it also precluded the invention of rail roads!&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Religion affects inventors
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The Christian attitude towards nature helps - The world was created by God
for man and nature exists to be manipulated and enjoyed&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;India’s entrenched caste system is the ultimate status-quo maintaining
structure
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;“Hindi doctrine holds that castepromotion is possible through
re-incarnation if one lives an appropriately resigned and obedient
life. … Poverty was holy and action was vanity.”&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;“A fiendish failure proof system to ensure the status quo”&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;This discourages rebeliousness&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Values - What do members of a society value?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ancient societies valued art and military accomplishments above wealth&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do the educated work? Are the people who work educated?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Openness to &lt;em&gt;new information&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Islamic beliefs started to converge to a point where it was believed that
most of the information had already been discovered and that a modern
Muslim need only accept and repeat&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-3&quot;&gt;Part 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dynastic states are tolerant of non-conformist behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Political unification doesn’t imply peace&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There was no demand for European goods in China whereas Europeans were
interested in a lot of things produced only in the Orient&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A single ruler instead of several rulers like in Europe - A single ruler can
stop any technology in it’s tracks with minimal effort. In Europe, inventors
could fairly easily emigrate to a nearby nation and hence it was harder for
rulers to suppress innovation for long&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technological progress went forward unabated in Britain because the rich and
powerful held their wealth in Real Estate and Agriculture and these were not
threatened by the progress in (say) the cotton industry&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Britain’s decline can probably be attributed to a dislike of applied science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A gentleman only concerns himself with the lofty ideals of pure science,
scientific research for it’s own sake&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great summarization:&lt;/strong&gt; What is this book about? I think that if you read
the Introduction part of the book, you understand that and know exactly what’s
about to come. So many books are free-wheeling narratives of the author’s
research areas that it has few (if any) connections to the topic at hand once
you are deep into the book. This book doesn’t lose the plot. It aims to provide
one possible explanation for the apparent difference in quality of life between
the West and most of Asia and Africa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the West is on teh whole comfortable, even opulent, compared to the
appaling poverty still rampant in most of Asia and Africa, it is in large part
thanks to its technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excellent structure:&lt;/strong&gt; I started noticing this in non-fiction books after
the majorly disorienting narrative in The Box (Levinson). That was also a great
book, but the fact that the narrative wasn’t chronological really messed up my
comprehension of the book. Lever of Riches stays on track and moves linearly
through the Ancient times, the Industrial Revolution to the late 20th century.
There are no unnecessary breaks, few parallel narratives which are always
geographically isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description and analysis of other prevalent theories:&lt;/strong&gt; The author leans
heavily on work done by others in his attempt to prove his own theory. And along
this line, it was fairly clear to me, every step along the way that whatever the
author was saying was thoroughly researched and that the author had seriously
considered what other people believed and had not dismissed their points of view
out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History of technological progress:&lt;/strong&gt; The second part of the book is a
concise history of technological progress. There are several diagrams and a lot
of dates and names. I felt that the author did justice to this topic and I
learnt a &lt;em&gt;LOT&lt;/em&gt; just from this part of the book. If anything, &lt;strong&gt;I highly
recommend&lt;/strong&gt; this part of the book in isolation. A better book of technological
history definitely exists out there and the author admits as much, but I felt
that the detail Mokyr goes into is just right. (My opinion is bound to change
when I read a more thorough history which touches on some of the things Mokyr
skipped over)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great comparisons:&lt;/strong&gt; The comparisons that make up the third part of the
book are definitely my highlight from this book. I liked the times and countries
he compared because I have struggled in the past to understand the vast gap in
the servies and quality of life in these places first hand, and this book helped
me understand one probable cause for these differences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not crazy about the Evolution analogy:&lt;/strong&gt; The last part of the book is an
attempt by Mokyr to draw several parallels between biological evolution and
technological progress. The analogy seems to hold in most cases and there are
several holes, etc. In general though, &lt;strong&gt;I didn’t like&lt;/strong&gt; this part of the book
as much as I liked the preceding 2 parts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ckn.io/blog/2017/11/14/wireguard-vpn-typical-setup/&quot;&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stavros.io/posts/how-to-configure-wireguard/&quot;&gt;guides&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mikkel.hoegh.org/2019/11/01/home-vpn-server-wireguard&quot;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbh7.com/2018/09/30/setting-up-a-wireguard-site-to-site-vpn-between-2-edgerouters/&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; which have a
set of steps and the commands to set-up Wireguard on a Linux computer. This post
is written along those lines but takes a different approach - it focuses more on
what one can learn about basic Linux networking by doing this setup themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;premise&quot;&gt;Premise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out with a fairly clear goal: Setup a VPN server inside a Digital
Ocean droplet to forward all local traffic through, using wireguard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use Wireguard mainly because it was inside the kernel which had this
subconscious implication that it would be blazing fast. Also, I have seen the
video on Wireguard’s website which has Alice and Bob side by side and in about
7 commands the video shows how &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bob: ping Alice&lt;/code&gt; starts working! This was fairly
revoutionary to me because until now I had used two kinds of VPNs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The free apps: This includes SurfEasy, which is how I used to use Spotify in
India before they offered their service here, CloudFlare’s new app which is
pretty easy to use but works only on my phone for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The enterprise kind: This is for work, and it is extremely painfree. It’s
also fast enough that I haven’t noticed a big slow down that often. I don’t
really know how it is all set-up inside, but like every company, there are some
professional IT engineers who have set this up so that no one wastes any time
trying to figure this out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current goal was to get something up and running which was easy to set-up,
fast when I was using it and worked seemlessly on a Linux desktop. Wireguard
seemed like the only choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sidenote-what-about-streisand&quot;&gt;Sidenote: What about Streisand?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are into self-setup VPN servers, you might have heard of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand&quot;&gt;Streisand&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s a huge Ansible playbook which will take some input from the user and then
setup a VPN server on the provider of your choice. The server that it sets up
can be used as a Tor bridge, an OpenVPN server, a Wireguard server, an HTTP
proxy server, SOCKS proxy or as an IPSec server. Overwhelmed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t overwhelmed yet, then let me tell you how the setup works: You run
the setup script, you enter your provider of choice, what you want (automatic
setup of all the provided components is encouraged, although you can choose to
install only the components you want, if you are so inclined), and then Ansible
starts it’s job. It will start running these playbooks on the VPS server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is pretty good until this point and at this point, the last time I
was setting this up, I decided to leave my computer be and get some food. When I
came back, I saw an error message that was waiting for me. I didn’t really get
it, so I googled it found the problem, fixed it and ran the setup script again.
Guess what? It started setting everything up from scratch. Yes. After seeing
that, I gave up on Streisand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sidenote-what-about-a-simple-http-proxy&quot;&gt;Sidenote: What about a simple HTTP proxy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squid-cache.org/&quot;&gt;Squid HTTP Proxy&lt;/a&gt; is great. It has a simple configuration file format
and it’s possible to run it using docker on any computer anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Prepare the configuration file&lt;/span&gt;
docker run &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--rm&lt;/span&gt; sameersbn/squid &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt; /etc/squid/squid.conf &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; squid.conf
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Edit the configuration file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Start the proxy server using this configuration&lt;/span&gt;
docker run &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt; squid &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--restart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;always &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--publish&lt;/span&gt; 3128:3128 &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$PWD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/squid.conf&quot;&lt;/span&gt;:/etc/squid/squid.conf &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    sameersbn/squid
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your goal is to only forward all your traffic, you can probably settle with
just this proxy. External websites will see the IP address of your droplet or
GCE instance or EC2 instance. This is extremely fast because the overhead is
extremely small and it is very cross platform because everything supports an
HTTP proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only, the only thing is, I had a nagging doubt about whether my HTTPS website
headers were put in the HTTP Connect request that was made to the proxy server.
I don’t know much beyond what I studied in my Networks course and what I learnt
from the TLS RFC, but I had a feeling that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; header was being passed
through and that meant the HTTP request between the proxy server and my computer
exposed the Host header (??). I wasn’t really sure about this. I didn’t ever
set-up Wireshark and properly look at what was going on the network. All in all,
this nagging in the back of my head ended up being the nail in the
use-HTTP-proxy-for-everything coffin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-wireguard&quot;&gt;Enter, Wireguard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes
state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more
useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be
considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general
purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit
for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it
is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely
deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already &lt;strong&gt;it might be
regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the
industry&lt;/strong&gt;.
– wireguard.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;, deceptively &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;. I had tried to set-up Wireguard once
before and I had failed miserably at it. I had run some commands on my personal
computer which ended with the computer not being able to access the internet at
all. I panicked for a short while as I found the opposite of every single
command I ran to at least get internet back. After this experience, I had
realized that Wireguard operated at a layer which below the application layer
where things can get messy really fast and it’s hard to get out a problem you
created with a command you don’t completely understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around, I had two advantages, I think. First, I had learnt about the
value of taking notes and writing down every command I was running through the
operations-type work I had done at work. And second, my personal computer was a
Thinkpad with the latest Ubuntu and I was not worried about running into any
hardware specific issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-establishing-the-tunnel&quot;&gt;Step 1: Establishing the tunnel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wireguard has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/&quot;&gt;quickstart video&lt;/a&gt;. It is a side-by-side of two peers which
starts from scratch and ends with a tunnel that connets the two computers. The
two peers get their own IPs on the tunnel and they can ping each other. Now, I
didn’t know how this would help me achieve my final goal of forwarding all my
traffic through another peer, but it seemed like the first step in understanding
wireguard and actually figuring out how to set it up properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a Digital Ocean droplet and I started running the two commands
side-by-side. I was noting down the commands I was running and the output of
each command as I went through the steps. I was also thinking about the
resources I was adding to my personal computer and the commands that I would
have to run to remove them. When I installed wireguard, I was asked to configure
secure boot and restart the computer and enter the secure boot password. This
was probably because wireguard is installed as a kernel module and secure boot
doesn’t like additions to the kernel outside of the boot process? This is all
complete conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after restarting once to set-up secure boot and once so that the network
interface device type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wireguard&lt;/code&gt; becomes available to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ip link&lt;/code&gt;. After this, I
continued to run the commands just as they are run on the side-by-side video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of that process, I had a tunnel between my computer and the droplet.
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ping 10.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; started working as it should. At this point, I checked the
output of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ip route&lt;/code&gt; and realized that all the traffic to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;10.0.0.0/8&lt;/code&gt; was being
sent through the wg0 network interface. I realized that I could do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh
10.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; to SSH into the droplet! This was my &lt;em&gt;first moment of epiphany&lt;/em&gt;; I
suddenly realized that the droplet might well be next to me in my house. My
computer and the droplet were on a network and knew about each other as 10.0.0.1
and 10.0.0.2. They could do things like move files across this network and it
will all go through Wireguard’s crypto and will not be visible to anyone else on
the network, not Digital Ocean, anyone in between or my home internet provider!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t configured forwarding all my traffic yet, but I at least had a skeleton
around which I could work. Also, I had learnt a lot more about &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ip link&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ip
addr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iptables&lt;/code&gt;, although I didn’t understand exactly how they all worked
together with Wireguard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sidenote:&lt;/em&gt; I installed docker and squid-proxy on the droplet and forwarded all
my traffic through 10.0.0.1:3128! This worked as I expected it to and changed my
public IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-watching-the-wireguard-talk&quot;&gt;Step 2: Watching the Wireguard talk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;1266&quot; height=&quot;712&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CejbCQ5wS7Q&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is incredibly rare that you learn more about a piece of software after
setting up one part of it. Wireguard is one of those rare pieces of software
that claims to achieve something so simple that you have to actually listen to
someone explaining it to believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zx2c4.com/&quot;&gt;Jason (@zx2c4)&lt;/a&gt; explains what Wireguard does and how it
achieves the goal it was built for: establishing a tunnel between any two
computers, as a kernel module. In particular, this diagram clarified a lot for
me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/wireguard_block_diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I had read in a couple of places now that when adding the server as a peer on
the client computer, setting &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;allowed-ips = 0.0.0.0/0&lt;/code&gt; will forward all of your
computer’s traffic through to the server. Now, I realized that when the packet
reaches the wireguard interface wg0, the packet’s destination IP will be matched
with the allowed-ips list to find the peer. If I wanted all traffic to go to the
same peer, I would simply add a single peer and set allowed-ips = everything.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the way back, the packet would be headed to the client computer and the
server configuration has the appropriate configuration already to route the
packet properly. So, no changes were required on the server side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Linux kernel: Ordinary routing table -&amp;gt; wg0”: I had not done anything for
this to be the case yet. I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireguard.com/netns/#routing-all-your-traffic&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; on the wireguard website which
showed me how to set up my routes so that everything would go through to the wg0
interface. I chose to go with the second approach of adding two rules that
forward all traffic to wg0 and then forward everything from there to the server.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The server gets all these packets on the wg0 interface which it has to then
send outside through the eth0 interface. This is achieved using some iptables
rules. I don’t fully understand these rules, they somehow work without
specifying the name of the source and the destination interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3-forwarding-traffic-without-name-resolution&quot;&gt;Step 3: Forwarding traffic without name resolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After watching the talk, I removed my existing peer and re-added the peer with
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;allowed-ips = 0.0.0.0/0&lt;/code&gt;. Then, I added the appropriate ip routes using the
NetNS guide on wireguard.com. The final piece in this puzzle was the changes on
the server side to move traffic from wg0 to eth0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trying commands from several tutorials, I finally found the set of three
rules that worked for me on a GitHub readme written by someone who was talking
about a very specific use-case for wireguard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;iptables &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-A&lt;/span&gt; FORWARD &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; %i &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-j&lt;/span&gt; ACCEPT
iptables &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-A&lt;/span&gt; FORWARD &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; %i &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-j&lt;/span&gt; ACCEPT
iptables &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; nat &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-A&lt;/span&gt; POSTROUTING &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; eth0 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-j&lt;/span&gt; MASQUERADE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, finally, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl &amp;lt;IP-for-icanhazip.com&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; returned the IP address of the
droplet and not my local computer. There was no DNS server that my computer
could use just yet, so there it was not able to convert the domain’s name into
the IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-dns&quot;&gt;Step 4: DNS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the wireguard setup guides recommend using Unbound DNS server installed
on the VPN server. The configuration for Unbound looked long and I wanted to get
something up and running before figuring more stuff out, so I decided to use
Google’s DNS server. I got this command from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/tree/src/tools/wg-quick/linux.bash?id=372152122766ad2ce8d9510cd5b6b0369a85dd75#n153&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wg-quick&lt;/code&gt; utility&lt;/a&gt; that
is packaged with wireguard-tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;nameserver %s\n&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;8.8.8.8&quot;&lt;/span&gt; | resolvconf &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;tun.wg0&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; 0 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-x&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sidenote:&lt;/em&gt; There are several other useful commands in the code for this
utility. I have been reading it in my spare time to figure out what other things
I could do to improve my setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After setting the DNS server up, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl icanhazip.com&lt;/code&gt; started working. Other
websites also started working properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evaluation&quot;&gt;Evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking speeds on fast.com showed me that using the VPN caused a slowdown of
about 20 times - down from 21 MBPS to 1 MBPS. This is pretty good. Also, as
literally all my traffic was going through wireguard now (except for DNS), I was
able to use all other application without any special configuration. For eg,
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; started showing the droplet’s IP as the source IP in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;who -a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;
wanted to add a new origin because the push for my SSH key was coming from a new
computer now. In general, everything seemed to work without anything breaking
catastrophically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At long last, I had a fast, working VPN solution for a Linux desktop computer.
Wireguard is revolutionary. It creates a point-to-point tunnel between two
computers (networked devices). What this tunnel is used for, is left to the
user’s discretion. Wireguard simple creates the tunnel and gets out of the way.
The only caveat is that one has to understand quite a bit about networking on
Linux computers to use it properly. As the creator of Wireguard says in his talk
above, “There’s no way to misconfigure wireguard and still have it work. If you
don’t configure it right, it simply doesn’t work”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, these are the things I want to do from here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install Unbound and start using it as a DNS server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set-up Wireguard on my phone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set-up wireguard on an OpenWRT router which moves the layer one step away from
the computer and makes it easier for phones to connect and use wireguard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/tree/src/tools/wg-quick/linux.bash?id=372152122766ad2ce8d9510cd5b6b0369a85dd75#n153&quot;&gt;Wireguard whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <id>/2019/11/02/format-list-pat-and-vim</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/dotfiles/commit/8b55363828e7794aa33166363c9ebdd51a46ebda#diff-2152fa38b4d8bb10c75d6339a959650dR344&quot;&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt; my vimrc file to set the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;formatlistpat&lt;/code&gt; variable
explicitly for markdown files. Before making this change, I had to dive into the
vim help pages and find out what option I really needed to change to get
un-ordered lists to start working write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like Markdown a lot. I take all my daily notes at work and at home in
Markdown. It works well for me. Also, I recently discovered the Docker image
that will help me convert from Markdown to any format effortlessly using a
simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/oneliners/commit/0301348531dbc712815115a88f2767196858caf0#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8R188-R191&quot;&gt;docker oneliner&lt;/a&gt; and the docker image &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jagregory/pandoc-docker&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that’s literally a part of everything that I start writing is
a list. My over-all file is structured as a list, so I care a lot about the
indentation of list entries. Before I made the change I started this post with,
my lists looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-md highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; This is a list item
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; This is a very long list item that wraps
to a second line
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; This is another list item
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how the second item starts from the beginning of the file and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; from the
first alphabet in the previous line? I realized that this was strange when I
wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-md highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt; Task 1
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt; Task 2: Keep track of the changes you made
   in Task 1
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt; Task 3: Perform in parallel with Task 2;
   Might need help from someone else
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and indented it with vim’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gq&lt;/code&gt;. I realized that Vim was capable of
understanding lists and formatting list items properly. Every time I have tried
to indent an un-ordered list in Vim with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gq&lt;/code&gt;, it absolutely fails and I just
have to go around and do it myself. But this great behaviour with numbered lists
showed me that there some option I could change to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-deep-dive&quot;&gt;The Deep Dive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I started looking for an add-on that unordered lists well. I started with
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plasticboy/vim-markdown&lt;/code&gt;. It is one of the most popular markdown plugins for
vim and I have never really tested it properly. So, I started off with it.
But it didn’t really solve the problem, I got the feeling that it even made it
worse somehow. I started looking online for other people who had run into this
problem and this is where I started reading about Vim options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached this incredibly enlightening &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown/issues/232&quot;&gt;vim-markdown issue&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Rewrapping a bullet
point inserts new bullet points&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; This was happening to me every time I tried
to write a multi-line list item and wrap it with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gq&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue had a few great &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; options which were mentioned during the
discussion around the bigger problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown/issues/232#issuecomment-392265461&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown/issues/232#issuecomment-246173676&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;formatlistpat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown/issues/232#issuecomment-246173676&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;formatoptions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three options seemed to be somehow connected to lists and their automatic
formatting when writing the text, and their formatting when explicitly
formatting with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gq&lt;/code&gt; over that part or the whole file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started looking through vim options and trying to find where this difference
between numbered and unordered lists stemmed from. The in-built &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:help&lt;/code&gt; command
is really good and the descriptions of most of the configuration options are
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; confusing at all! Some of them are confusing, admittedly. But the
descriptions for these three were at least fairly simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;comments: A comma separated list of strings that can start a comment line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For markdown, the only character that behaves even remotely like a comment is
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; character used to create a blockquote. Often when writing blockquotes
which run multiple lines, it’s useful if the editor would just wrap the text and
insert the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt; characters at the beginning of each line as blockquotes tend to
be a single paragraph and a quick &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gqip&lt;/code&gt; fixing that is very useful. So, this
was the first option I changed. I changed it to be just &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;b:&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. I don’t really
undersatnd what the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;b:&lt;/code&gt; is, but this immediately fixed the formatting of
numbered lists whenever I tried to do that! Unordered lists were still not
working well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidenote:&lt;/strong&gt; Running &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:put=&amp;amp;comments&lt;/code&gt; puts the value of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/code&gt;
configuration into the current buffer! I found this extremely useful when trying
to inspect the configuration value of a regex without having to stare at the
bottom line where the values are generally displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;formatlistpat:  A pattern that is used to recognize a list header.  This is
used for the “n” flag in ‘formatoptions’.
default: “^\s&lt;em&gt;\d+[]:.)}\t ]\s&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aha! &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;formatlistpat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;formatoptions&lt;/code&gt; are related! And the default regex is
pretty easy to understand: it matches things of the form &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1)&lt;/code&gt;; i.e.
numbered lists only! WHAT! I checked the value of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;formatlistpat&lt;/code&gt; for the
markdown buffer I was writing my notes through this dive in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;^\s*\d+\.\s+|^[-*+]\s+|^[^\ze[^\]]+]:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t really understand this regex. I could see that it was trying to read
numbered and unordered lists, but the third section in this regex with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\ze&lt;/code&gt;
eluded me. In any case, I figured that if I could simplify this regex and write
one myself which solved only the case that I cared about (unordered lists
starting with a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;), then I could change it later as I saw fit. So, I replaced
it with just the middle part of the regex: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;^\s*[-*+]\s&lt;/code&gt;. I inserted the
unlimited number of optional whitespaces at the beginning of the line because
nested lists are definitely part of my note-taking style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as I tried wrapping list items, I saw that it worked as I expected!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-md highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; This is a list item
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; This is a very long list item that wraps
  to a second line
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; This is another list item
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still didn’t quite understand the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;formatoption&lt;/code&gt; configuration though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;formatoptions: This is a sequence of letters which describes how automatic
formatting is to be done.  See |fo-table|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;formatoptions&lt;/code&gt; value in my editor was: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tcqln&lt;/code&gt;. Looking at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fo-table&lt;/code&gt;,
I saw that it did most of the things that I was taking for granted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Auto-wrap at textwidth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Auto-wrap comments at textwidth but insert the comments character&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow formatting with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave long lines as is when entering Insert mode&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When formatting texts recognizes lists using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;formatlistpat&lt;/code&gt; regex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meaning of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; option was particulary interesting to me. The help text
clearly specifies that although the option is called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; for “numbered list
formatting”, lists are identified using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;formatlistpat&lt;/code&gt; which can identify any
kind of list that you might come up with. (If you start your list items with
letters, instead of hyphens or numbers, just set up &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;formatlistpat&lt;/code&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I had two more things that I wanted to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve the regex to recognize numbered lists&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve the regex to recognize lists of TODO items in markdown
 ```sh
    &lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Todo Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Todo Item 2: This is a long
    todo item
 ```&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still working on the second part of this. For the point about numbered
lists, I have really started re-evaluating if I even need numbered lists. I
don’t ever write numbered lists if I can help it. (The ordering of lists is
quite clear from the fact that we read text vertically downwards and it wouldn’t
make sense for the third list entry to be the first point when writing the same
list in an un-ordered format)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another on-going problem that has been slighlty more annoying has been vim’s
strange formatting whenever the content inside a parentheses goes beyond a
single line or I end the previous line with a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; (comma). I am not yet sure
which option is causing this particular problem, but whatever that option is, I
am going to find it and I am going to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Managing DNS (or any other infrastructure) using Terraform</title>
   <link href="/2019/10/13/cloudfare-dns-to-terraform"/>
   <updated>2019-10-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2019/10/13/cloudfare-dns-to-terraform</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This post ended up being a lot longer than I expected it to be! It’s a
post about why Terraform is great, even for setups where configurations don’t
change often and how you can use it to share the access that you have with other
people without giving them access to the actual infrastructure account. I will
make a separate post about the specifics of importing DNS records from
Cloudflare into Terraform and the process I used for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terraform is great! It is a way to manage your infrastructure using a set of
version-controlled text files with a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt; command that tells you what is going
to change and an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; command that applies the changes that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt; told
you about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where terraform gets really good is when you store the Terraform State file in a
GCS bucket and run the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; commands in your repository’s CI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a loot of hoopla for DNS management of a personal domain. Is it worth it?
Well, that depends on whether you have the time and motivation to set it up.
Once you set it up though, it’s INCREDIBLY convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what&quot;&gt;What?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terraform has three concepts that are pretty useful to know about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terraform state:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the part of your infrastructure that has been
“imported” into Terraform. Terraform manages the state of these “resources”. If
you change any of these resoures from the web GUI and not through terraform,
terraform has no idea about the changes you made and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt; will start
getting weird.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terraform configuration files:&lt;/strong&gt; These are the files with the actual
resources. Each resource has a type and an identifier inside terraform. And it
has some arguments and attributes. Arguments are configurable and can be changed
through these files. Attributes are read-only and generally include things like
a generated ID which is used by the infrastructure provider to keep track of
your resource.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terraform providers:&lt;/strong&gt; Providers are plugin-type software packages which
form the interface between Terraform and the infrastructure provider. As far as
I understand, Terraform understands the 3 changes that can be done on any given
resource: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt;.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;During &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Terraform calls the provider and gives it the changes that were made
  to the terraform configuration files&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The provider then calls the API of the infrastructure provider to find
  out what changed&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The provider gives terraform the changes&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;During &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Terraform calls the provider and tells it the resources to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;,
  &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The provider calls the API of the infrastructure provider and makes
  the appropriate &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; requests&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The provider returns to terraform the actual changes made&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terraform backend:&lt;/strong&gt; A backend is the location where the state file is
stored. By default, this is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;local&lt;/code&gt;. You store and manage the state file
yourself. You can also set this up to be in a cloud storage option like Digital
Ocean Spaces or Google Cloud Storage. Storing the state file in the cloud allows
you to give others access to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in this manner, terraform has completed abstracted out the actual
infrastructure being managed from the provider that it is provided by.
Everything is a resource in the terraform world, and there can be only three
operations to a resource: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-useful-is-it&quot;&gt;How useful is it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, just having a log of all the changes you have made to your DNS records is
pretty useful. You can go back and forth in time, you will never really have to
deal with IPs again because of how easy it would be to create a new record, and
so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other features that terraform brings to the table are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An audit log that can be seen by &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; with access to the repository&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaborators who can add records without having access to the actual
infrastructure provider account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the first and second are extremely useful for DNS management. I use
Cloudfare as the DNS provider for my personal domain, and cloudfare has this
annoying way of changing DNS credentials from one account to another account.
You have to export the DNS records, import it into the new account and then
change the NS records at the domain provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to do that once for metakgp.org (another domain that my account is
        connected to) and it &lt;em&gt;did not&lt;/em&gt; go well. Something went wrong, the
transfer didn’t work and the website was down for about 12 hours. This wasn’t
very catastrophic, it’s a college project and it went down at a time when very
few people were trying to access the domain. Nevertheless, the whole point of
that was to ensure that the DNS was being managed by someone who was in the
college instead of someone who had graduated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing about colleges is that people keep graduating! And few people in their
freshman or sophomore year have any clue about what DNS is or what records are
or how to change them safely etc. I learnt most of the things I know about DNS
in my fourth year at college. So, this would be a perennial problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the basic thing that I was looking for from a move to terraform was a way to
safely share access to the infrastructure provider with other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-completely-local-setup&quot;&gt;A completely local setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can have a bunch of terraform configuration files in a repository
alongwith the state file. You can run appropriate &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;terraform plan&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;terraform apply&lt;/code&gt; commands manually. The state file is a file that has to be
maintained separately from the configuration files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to do it that’s fairly manual and works for use-cases where changes are
not very common and are centralized with a few people is to keep the state file
checked into Git. The state file is a JSON file and can be easily stored and
versioned. The local flow would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You import your DNS records into the local configuration files + the state
files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You put this repository out there&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People make a pull request with the changes they want to make
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;terraform plan&lt;/code&gt; manually and post the output on the PR&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You (and others) review their PR; you merge it when they look okay&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now, you (or anyone who has access) manually run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;terraform apply&lt;/code&gt; and apply
the changes that were requested&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is already a great improvement on the nightmarish process of moving DNS
management from account to account just to let others take over access. You have
to remain involved in the process, yes, but at least others can review and all
you have to do is run the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-if-you-use-continuous-integration&quot;&gt;What if you use Continuous Integration?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous Integration (CI) makes this whole process incredibly easy. It
de-centralizes DNS management without de-centralizing control over the provider
account. Here’s the flow with CI:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You import your DNS records into a terraform state and into local
configuration files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You set-up Google Cloud Storage (GCS) to act as the backend for your terraform
state
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Now, your state file is stored on GCS instead of being stored locally on
  your computer!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Anyone with the right credentials can run the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; commands
  now!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You set-up a CI pipeline where opening a pull-request runs the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt; command
and merging to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; runs the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; command
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You have to give the CI pipeline access to the provider and the GCS bucket
  using a service account&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Both these things are fairly easy to accomplish&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now, you let others make Pull Requests
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When someone makes a pull-request, they can go to the CI pipeline and see
  the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt; looks okay, they can request review&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Others review the PR and approve it if everything looks good&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Anyone with permissions to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; can merge the PR and have
  the changes show up in their infrastructure right away!
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Note that the person who is merging doesn’t need to have access to the
  GCS bucket OR to the infrastructure provider! All they need to have
  access to is the repository that is maintaining the configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is the holy grail. A single repository on which users can be added and
removed as required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If changes you didn’t want to merge have been merged to master, you can revert
the PR and merge to master again. VOILA!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If something goes wrong, you can lock down access&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you fear that the CI keys have been taken by a bad actor, you can remove
that actor and roll them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Terraform lets you share the ability to make changes to your infrastructure with
a wide group of people without giving them any direct access to the
infrastructure itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Terraform lets you maintain an audit log of the changes that happened to your
infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Terraform lets you roll-back unwanted changes with a simple revert PR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt-get &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt; python3-distutils python3-dev

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;vim

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;make &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-longer-version&quot;&gt;The Longer Version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I put the commands at the top of the post because I hate it when
people start with the story and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/code&gt; comes at the end of the blog post. I
&lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; believe that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/code&gt; of all blog posts and long text-filled posts
should be at the top of the piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started compiling &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; from source a few months ago. See, I needed to get an
extension called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/voldikss/vim-search-me&quot;&gt;vim-search-me&lt;/a&gt;. This extension was calling a function
called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;trim()&lt;/code&gt; but only newer versions of vim had this function. I opened a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/voldikss/vim-search-me/pull/8&quot;&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt; on the original repository to ensure that the call wasn’t made if the
function didn’t exist, but I also wanted a version of vim which actually had
this function so I could use the extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digging into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; issues, pull requests and source code a little bit, I
realized that the function was introduced in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/295ac5ab5e840af6051bed5ec9d9acc3c73445de&quot;&gt;a recent commit&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to
build a version of vim which was newer or equal to this and would allow me to
actually use this function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the first time around, building &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; was extremely easy. I
downloaded the source code using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt;, switched to the appropriate
release tag, configured the build with a prefix of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/usr/local&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./configure
--prefix=/usr/local&lt;/code&gt;), &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo make install&lt;/code&gt;! Voila, I had a custom
built version of vim! The part I probably “dig”-ed the most was that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim
--version&lt;/code&gt; output actualy printed the name of the computer and the date/time
when I compiled it! This was pretty interesting and I realized that now I could
get patches that were made on the original vim code base whenever I wanted.
There was no need to depend on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; that comes packaged inside the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; repositories or inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;macOS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;requiring-python-support&quot;&gt;Requiring Python support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At work, I write a lot of Go code and almost all the code has to have tests.
The code coverage threshold is around 80%. So, adding any new function
immediately necessitates the addition of a test for that function. Now, there’s
a way that tests are written for Go functions and I was beginning to realize
which pattern I liked and it turns out I was re-writing a lot of the templating
code to set-up the test, every single time I started writing a new test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips&quot;&gt;UltiSnips&lt;/a&gt; is a vim extension that lets you store Language specific snippets
which can be inserted into a file when the filetype matches the snippet you have
stored. I heard good things about the extension from my co-workers and found it
in some of their dotfiles repositories! I installed the extesnion and tried to
start &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; and it said that it needed &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; support! I hadn’t compiled &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;
with python support, so I had to find out how!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;vim &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--version&lt;/span&gt; | ag &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;python&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
+cmdline_hist      +langmap           &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-python&lt;/span&gt;            +visual
+cmdline_info      +libcall           &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-python3&lt;/span&gt;           +visualextra
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-the-correct-configure-flags&quot;&gt;Finding the correct &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./configure&lt;/code&gt; flags&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The configuration script output prints all the flags, their values, and the
output when the checks required to enable their inclusion in the build were
performed. The python related flags were &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--enable-pythoninterp&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--enable-python3interp&lt;/code&gt;. System python on both my work computer and my home
computer was python 3.6, but I didn’t want to take a chance. So, I explicitly
specified python3 and ran the configuration script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my work computer (a Macbook Pro from last year), supplying just the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--enable-python3interp&lt;/code&gt; to my configuration script made everything work fine. I
didn’t actually realize that something else might be necessary because it worked
fine. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo make install&lt;/code&gt; and I had Python support in vim!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my home computer (a Thinkpad) with Ubuntu 18.04, things were slightly more
involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first error I saw with just the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--enable-python3interp&lt;/code&gt; flag was the
configuration script’s inability to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;import distutils.sysconfig&lt;/code&gt; inside Python3.
A couple StackOverflow answers later I realized that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python3-distutils&lt;/code&gt;
package installed that python3 module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;dpkg &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-l&lt;/span&gt; | ag &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;python3-distutils&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt-get &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt; python3-distutils
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;python &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;import distutils.sysconfig&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This error being fixed now, I ran into my second error. This was a slightly
weirder one. It said that it couldn’t find the configuration directory for my
Python installation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/5293524&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; StackOverflow answer pointed me to a
configuration script flag which allowed me to explicitly specify the path to my
Python configuration directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third error I ran into was stranger:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unable to find the Python.h file inside the python configuration directory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was showing an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#include &amp;lt;Python.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; line from some file containing C
code. The above answer also had a line about having to install the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python2-dev&lt;/code&gt;
package using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; because it isn’t pre-packaged inside the Ubuntu
installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On Ubuntu 10.04 you have to install ‘python2.6-dev’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I installed the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python3-dev&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;dpkg &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-l&lt;/span&gt; | ag &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;python3-dev&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt-get &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt; python3-dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;configure&lt;/code&gt; command worked and succeeded! The python related
lines were succinct, and didn’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; indicate success. But they didn’t
indicate failure either. So, I ran &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; creates the binary inside the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim/src&lt;/code&gt; folder. Running the binary from there will immediately tell you if the
feature is installed or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;./src/vim &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--version&lt;/span&gt; | ag &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;python&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
+cmdline_hist      +langmap           &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-python&lt;/span&gt;            +visual
+cmdline_info      +libcall           +python3           +visualextra
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had built &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt; support! Now, the lines at the top of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim
--version&lt;/code&gt; which tell you when &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; was last built and who built it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;vim &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--version&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-n4&lt;/span&gt;

   <title>Firefox Add-on to jump from GitHub to CircleCI extremely fast!</title>
   <link href="/2019/08/25/circleci-workflows-opener-add-on"/>
   <updated>2019-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2019/08/25/circleci-workflows-opener-add-on</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;what&quot;&gt;What?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use GitHub and CircleCI at work. One of the most common workflows for me, is
to merge a PR, click on the repository name to go to the repo page, scroll down
to the Readme and click on the CircleCI indicator to check the status of the CI
job kicked by the merge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the CI workflow is done and completes successfully, I go back to the repo
page and click on “Releases”, create a new release (a Git tag) and then again go
to the readme to go back and wait for the Release CI to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that is done, I open Spinnaker and wait some more for that to get
triggered. For some reason, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spinnaker.io/concepts/&quot;&gt;Spinnaker&lt;/a&gt; takes about 10 minutes to detect that
a new image with a tag matching a provided regex was pushed to GCR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, you might have noticed that I switch between GitHub and CircleCI a
lot. Now, most repositories at work have a CircleCI indicator at the top. If
they don’t, there’s always the option to open a PR and wait for someone to
approve it and then you can finally merge it. But this whole process was
extremely annoying to me, because there’s no &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; for this indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, the link patterns are fixed and extremely easy to generate using just
regex!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub:   &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://github.com/username/repository/.*&lt;/code&gt;
CircleCI: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://circleci.com/gh/username/repository/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all you really need to do is replace the beginning and remove anything after
the end of the repository name: that’s a textbook usecase for a bookmarklet with
JavaScript!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-not-a-bookmarklet&quot;&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a bookmarklet?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I wrote a bookmarklet. Very short and sweet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;javascript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/https:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;github.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;baseRemoved&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;https://github.com/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;baseRemoved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;account&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;https://circleci.com/gh/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;account&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I add it into a bookmark and click it. Nothing happens. The console shows me an
error that sort-of tells me something useful, but not really:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/github-bookmarklet-image.png&quot; alt=&quot;error&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSP &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/2013-04-19-content-security-policy/#bookmarklets&quot;&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/a&gt; affect bookmarklets, but it &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=866522&quot;&gt;does on Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, for the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1478037&quot;&gt;time-being&lt;/a&gt; at least. The issue in Firefox that stops the bookmarklet from
running has been going on for nearly 6 years now! That’s an awful lot of time
people have been dealing with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-add-on&quot;&gt;The Add-On!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extensions have more permissions than a bookmarklet. A user consciously installs
them and they are reviewed before they go on the Firefox add-on store. I started
looking through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons&quot;&gt;add-on developer documentations&lt;/a&gt; to find the right APIs
that I wanted. Originally, I was looking for a keyboard shortcut. But I realized
that that would be tough and that I should stick to doing a clickable element
before aiming higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next plan was to add a fixed HTML element on all GitHub repository pages
which would give me a reliable method to switch from GitHub to CircleCI no
matter which computer I was on. This reliability was particularly important to
me, I wanted the element to be in the same place on all GitHub repository pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out the way to do that is something called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pageAction&quot;&gt;page action&lt;/a&gt;! It looked
perfect for my use-case. It was a button near the address bar. As a cherry on
top, I could &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/commands#Special_shortcuts&quot;&gt;connect a keyboard shortcut&lt;/a&gt; to it using a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; construct!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Firefox add-on documentation is extremely good! They have example extensions
which use each JavaScript API that is supported, and for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pageAction&lt;/code&gt; it was
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/bbacbd0c40eb41622625584355baf077ed598669/apply-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apply-css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Going through this extension’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;background.js&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;manifest.json&lt;/code&gt;, I was able to quickly come up with a dev version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I cleaned the code up some more, made sure that it had icons and the
other images that were required were present (I used Gimp for a few minutes. By
any designer’s standards, &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icyflame/open-circleci-workflows-firefox/master/icons/open-circleci-workflows-96.png&quot;&gt;this icon&lt;/a&gt; is probably hideous)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After pushing the add-on code to GitHub, I created the add-on bundle and
uploaded it to the Firefox store. I did that at 2019-08-24 17:00 JST (UTC+0900).
It’s been 24 hours, and I have gone from spot 22/22 to 5/22 now. I don’t know if
the review is taking longer because it’s the weekend or what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/github-bookmarklet-store-review-queue.png&quot; alt=&quot;queue-spot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-a-chrome-extension-what&quot;&gt;Bonus: A Chrome extension! What?!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my co-workers use Chrome and I have read a little bit about the
WebExtensions API and how it’s a standard and can be used across browsers and
what not. So, I wanted to give it a quick try and see if I could make it work on
Chrome with a few tweaks. It turned out to be fairly easy! The Chrome store
forces on you several severe restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A 128x128 icon which has 16 transparaent pixels on both sides
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Why must Google force the developer? Surely, they can pad the image once
  it has been uploaded and transform it to whatever size they want as long as
  the aspect ratio is 1:1 (Square)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A 1280x800 screenshot
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Funnily enough, they will NOT accept ANY size except 1280x800. That I find
  very hard to digest because most HD screen-shots are 1920x1020 which can be
  naturally resized to 1280x720. This 1280x800 thing is particularly strange.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Anyway, I opened up Gimp and used the Align tool to make an image that
  size.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; I am really starting to warm up to how useful Gimp has been lately!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once, I jumped through those hoops and had the right images, I was able to
submit my add-on and voila, there my extension was! No review process to get
things on the Chrome Extensions store. That would make me squeamish, if I was
using Chrome as my daily-driver and had a couple shady extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-circleci-workflows/&quot;&gt;Firefox Add-on&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-circleci-workflows/fcjcanbkalgfniilkedfjgaglfgdjlcb&quot;&gt;Chrome Extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/open-circleci-workflows-firefox&quot;&gt;GitHub Repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2019-09-15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firefox 69 was released a few days ago! Now, bookmarklets to change the URL of a
website &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1478037&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Setting up Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on a Thinkpad</title>
   <link href="/2019/07/27/setting-up-ubuntu-18"/>
   <updated>2019-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2019/07/27/setting-up-ubuntu-18</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I have setup a brand new computer. I did set up a Mac
when I started working in September last year, but that was more of a
step-by-step thing where I just started with my existing dotfiles and picked up
stuff along the way from people around me who had been working for a much longer
time and knew of &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; great Vim extensions and tools that I had previously
never heard of. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/shell/zsh/prezto/2019/04/06/oh-my-zsh-to-prezto&quot;&gt;Prezto&lt;/a&gt; was one of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on an IBM Thinkpad L390. It was released
around December last year (or earlier this year?) and sounded like a really good
handy laptop for travelling, particularly. I bought it with a mid-range RAM
config of 16GB and a 512 GB SSD. For comparison, my current personal machine was
a Dell Inspiron from 2015 with a 1TB HDD and 8 GB of RAM; so this was a pretty
significant upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL; DR&lt;/strong&gt; Installing Ubuntu took about 5 minutes flat. I am not even
kidding; I never realized that copying files and cleaning up the disk is one of
the slowest steps in an install and is a complete bottleneck! Also, the
partition setup was much simpler for me this time. 80 GB Windows 10, 80 GB root
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; and the rest for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt;. That’s it. I decided to keep it extremely simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deciding to keep Windows 10 was a pretty big decision, and I definitely took the
safer option. I was particularly worried about warranty issues if I nuked
Windows because I am convinced that any service center would &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; have
trouble-shooting software for Windows. In fact, every time I have taken the Dell
in for a repair, I always boot them into Windows and leave them in there. So,
   even though I was looking forward to nuking Windows and having a pure Ubuntu
   single-boot machine, I decided to continue with Dual Boot. My concern of
   Windows being at the top of the Grub screen had gone away since my last
   install of Ubuntu and subsequent discovery that you can actually control the
   order in which the operating systems show up on the Grub screen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the installation was done, I set about getting all the software that I considered
essential. The last time I did this with the Macbook, I didn’t keep track of what commands I was
running and this was a mistake. So, this time, I took &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/icyflame/1399a7462f4c56103f8417b26875f5c5&quot;&gt;copius
notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/1152417034115747841&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2019-07-20-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also added this gist to my dotfiles, just in case I ever have to setup an Ubuntu computer from
scratch again. (One of the steps I was fumbling at was linking the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.z*&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$ZDOTDIR&lt;/code&gt;. I hadn’t
linked these files and didn’t realize that prezto won’t work without them!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using this Thinkpad for about 2 weeks now, and everything has been
going well so far. WiFi, sound, the touch pad, brightness and volume controls
everything seem to be working fine. I haven’t run into severe Ubuntu-Thinkpad
compatibility issues yet. And hopefully, I won’t run into them far into the
future!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ongoing issue with Firefox add-ons due to an expired certificate</title>
   <link href="/2019/05/04/mozilla-add-on-intermediate-certificate-signing-issue"/>
   <updated>2019-05-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2019/05/04/mozilla-add-on-intermediate-certificate-signing-issue</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an ongoing issue at the time of writing (19:30 2019-05-04
        JST). The team at Mozilla is aware of this issue and is working hard to
fix it as soon as they can. You can track the bug &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1548973&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and on the IRC
channel &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#firefox&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;irc.mozilla.org&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;detection&quot;&gt;Detection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue started around 6 pm PST on the 4th of May when some people noticed
that their add-ons were disabled by the browser, though the add-ons were working
just fine just a few hours ago. (Some people had theirs stop working during on
        ongoing session!) This led to the opening of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/addons/issues/978&quot;&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; and a
bug on Mozilla’s bug tracker for Firefox, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1548983&quot;&gt;Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran into this as soon as I woke up this morning and opened my work computer to
start my on-call shift. I didn’t know I had a pretty interesting on-call session
in front of me. On a 12-hour on-call shift, I didn’t have much to do anyway. So,
   I ran through what the issue was, how it started happening, and what people
   are saying about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidenote:&lt;/strong&gt; I set up IRSSI because it felt like a lot of the discussion was
happening on IRC and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on GitHub or bugzilla (mainly because the developers
        inside Mozilla locked the GitHub issues and restricted who could comment
        to keep those channels clear; as more and more people started to figure
        out that what they were running into didn’t have an easy fix, these
        pages would only have started getting more polluted and the main problem
        would have become harder to find)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRC was filled with a bunch of people who were talking about where the issue
started and why it was allowed to happen. One of the most common threads of
conversation was: “This feels like we are using a product built inside a walled
garden”. Firefox devs continued to tell the world that they knew about the
problem and were working hard to fix it but what this fix was and how they were
approaching it was not clear to anyone on IRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the issue itself, one look at the title clarified what it was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All extensions disabled due to expiration of intermediate signing cert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s delve into what exactly this means!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mozilla-add-on-signing&quot;&gt;Mozilla Add-on signing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla has a great wiki on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Extension_Signing#Algorithm&quot;&gt;how they sign add-ons&lt;/a&gt;. The add-on submission
process goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developer submits a plaintext XPI to Mozilla Addons&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mozilla analyzes this XPI for security vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When approved, Mozilla signs this package
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Mozilla has a root CA certificate that’s shipped with the browser (R)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Mozilla has an intermediate certificate that’s used for add-on signing
(I)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Mozilla derives a new certificate from this intermediate certificate -
the end-point entity certificate (E)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Mozilla signs a file with cert E&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The package is shipped with this signature (from cert E), the cert E, and
the cert I.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After downloading an add-on, the Browser verifies this signature:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Verifies that the signature was made by cert E&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Verifies that the cert E has a valid chain back to the root cert&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Verifies that the files match what was signed (using a bunch of hashes)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current problem: &lt;strong&gt;The intermediate certificate, cert I, has expired!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the certificate itself is available in every single add-on, and can be
inspected. So, that’s exactly what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-certificates&quot;&gt;The Certificates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a certificate, you must get an add-on package; I chose uBlock because
that was the first thing I noticed when I was looking for one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the XPI for any add-on&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unzip this xpi file using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;unzip -d extension&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The signature is inside the file &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;META-INF/mozilla.rsa&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openssl&lt;/code&gt; to inspect the certificates!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl pkcs7 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-in&lt;/span&gt; META-INF/mozilla.rsa &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-inform&lt;/span&gt; DER &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-print_certs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the output of this for the uBlock extension &lt;a href=&quot;/public/data/mozilla-add-on-issue-cert-details&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These lines inside the intermediate certificate (second certificate in the
        certificate chain are the culprit of the present issue):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Data:
    Version: 3 (0x2)
    Serial Number: 1048580 (0x100004)
Signature Algorithm: sha384WithRSAEncryption
    Issuer: C=US, O=Mozilla Corporation, OU=Mozilla AMO Production Signing Service, CN=root-ca-production-amo
    Validity
        Not Before: May  4 00:09:46 2017 GMT
        Not After : May  4 00:09:46 2019 GMT
    Subject: C=US, O=Mozilla Corporation, OU=Mozilla AMO Production Signing Service, CN=signingca1.addons.mozilla.org/emailAddress=foxsec@mozilla.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The validity of the intermediate certificate ended today. The actual expiry
was about 1 hour ago, but this issue has been on going for nearly 9 hours now,
    so I don’t know what that is about. Hopefully, we get a post mortem from
    Mozilla once the issue is fixed and we can all find out exactly what the
    issue was!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t worked with CA and certificate systems for quite a while now. But as
far as I can tell, this is the solution that comes to mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Issue a new intermediate certificate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-generate and re-sign all add-on packages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upload these new add-on packages with the signature to AMO&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get everyone to download the extensions again OR release a special patch to
the browser which downloads the add-ons again for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Mozilla was able to release a work-around for people who didn’t
have their add-ons disabled. They said they did that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mozamo/status/1124569680662777856&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. One of these
users was on IRC and they shared their certificates for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;uMatrix&lt;/code&gt; extension
&lt;a href=&quot;https://clbin.com/PgEOF&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. These still expire at the same time. So, Mozilla was able to find
some sort of quick workaround which helped them make browsers ignore the results
of the add-on verification test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I was enlightened by a user on IRC that the fix they deployed was a
Study. These can be seen inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;about:studies&lt;/code&gt; and this particular hotfix is
called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hotfix-reset-xpi-verification-timestamp-1548973&lt;/code&gt;! Nifty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote a post a few months ago about how cool &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openssl&lt;/code&gt; is! I was finally
able to use it in the wild with this issue! Check out the post &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/openssl/cryptography/command-line/2018/05/25/openssl-is-awesome/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Oh-My-Zsh to Prezto - 4 seconds faster</title>
   <link href="/2019/04/06/oh-my-zsh-to-prezto"/>
   <updated>2019-04-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2019/04/06/oh-my-zsh-to-prezto</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have heard a lot about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto&quot;&gt;prezto&lt;/a&gt;. People who work with me use it and we got
into this recent discussion about how slow a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; request inside your zshrc
makes your shell. Strangely enough, I hadn’t noticed that it made the shell slow
at all. In fact, I was saying that it didn’t make it any slower than without it.
I removed it from my &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;zshrc&lt;/code&gt; and checked it and indeed, it didn’t make my shell
any slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days went by; I was thinking about this when I was next thinking about why
I hadn’t noticed this clear increase in the time. So, I looked at the time my
shell took to start up again. It was … interesting: &lt;strong&gt;6 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YUP. 6 seconds on a machine with an SSD, 16 GB of RAM and an i7 processor. So,
what is the problem here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-search&quot;&gt;The Search&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/dotfiles/blob/ce3e858e37eb2b7ea9efddefa9323ef3d0d70d62/zsh/zshrc.symlink&quot;&gt;zshrc&lt;/a&gt; that sources several other files when it loads. Going
through my main zshrc and all those zsh files, I saw that everything in there
was a definition: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;export&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;alias&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;function&lt;/code&gt;. Apart from this, I was sourcing
a few other things: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fzf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/code&gt;. Testing these separately, I could see
that these were extremely fast and not the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when I realized that I would have to profile my &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;zshrc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;START: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; +%s&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; +%s&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# op&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;endt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; +%s&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;op_name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$endt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$endt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added a bunch of blocks like the one above to my zshrc. I sourced a few times.
I kept adding and removing these blocks. I eliminated the sourcing of the 18 or
so zsh files in my &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dotfiles&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; They were all happening within the same second.
I looked at the plugin loader, the definition and sourcing of some add-ons like
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;travis&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cargo&lt;/code&gt;, but they all happened very fast too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strange thing was: I couldn’t find the culprit. Every step that I profiled
happened very fast, and YET, the whole process took nearly 6 seconds. What was
going on here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-realization&quot;&gt;The Realization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started searching for reasons and people running into this hurdle before. I
had prezto in the back of my head, so I searched for that and comparisons too.
&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; was when I reached &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeromedalbert.com/migrate-from-oh-my-zsh-to-prezto/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; amazing article. The author put it quite
succinctly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Zsh is an amazing shell, … &lt;strong&gt;BUT. It’s God. Damn. Slow!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those were my feelings too. I have used oh-my-zsh for nearly 5 years now, it has
served me very well. It has helped me get through some tough times (I am almost
certainly romanticising); But it was time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://linhmtran168.github.io/blog/2013/12/15/ditching-oh-my-zsh-for-prezto/&quot;&gt;another article&lt;/a&gt;. The steps were very simple. My configuration would
work as is. The one thing that wouldn’t work would be the prompt. I would have
to find a prompt I liked; Or, if it was &lt;em&gt;un-obscure&lt;/em&gt; enough, recreate my beloved
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes#ys&quot;&gt;ys&lt;/a&gt; on prezto. (More about why I love this prompt so much in the Postscript)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-switch&quot;&gt;The Switch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having mulled over this enough, I decided to go for it. It was quite clear in my
head, the only things that could really break were my prompt and my color
scheme. Both things that couldbe reverted by cleaning everything up and making a
new install of oh-my-zsh and trying another weekend. With that re-assurance, I
copied my existing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.oh-my-zsh&lt;/code&gt; into a backup folder, commited and pushed
everything in my &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dotfiles&lt;/code&gt; and began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-b&lt;/span&gt; switch-to-prezto
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process was fairly simple. After &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;uninstall_oh_my_zsh&lt;/code&gt; and installing prezto
using the commands on the readme, I had a running shell. My zshrc was working
well. Perhaps the thing that most surprised me was that the color scheme was
unaffected! I have dealt with fixing the color scheme before and it was
incredibly obscure, undocumented and painful. So, that is one thing I was
extremely grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having ensured that the shell itself worked without any of the stuff on top of
it, I started looking at the list of plugins (prezto calls them &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/blob/1f4601e44c989b90dc7314b151891fa60a101251/modules/README.md#modules&quot;&gt;modules&lt;/a&gt;)
that I wanted. I ensured that I was getting &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fish&lt;/code&gt;-like auto-suggestions before
I even contemplated this move because that is one of the most useful things
EVER! (It’s so incredibly fast; compared to even &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fzf&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I included the ones that I absolutely needed and auto-suggestions and
syntax-highlighting started working! It was surprisingly easy and in fact,
easier than oh-my-zsh which is so popular because it is easy and versatile. I
had quite a bit of trouble setting up the right colors in oh-my-zsh with
auto-suggestions because the color has to be dimmer than the color you are
typing in but at the same time, it has to have enough contrast with the terminal
background to ensure that you can see the suggestion without straining your
eyes. I had hit the right balance with this with a slight change on top of
solarized-dark.256 and I didn’t want to go through setting this up again.
Thankfully, prezto worked fine the first time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I had a working shell with all my aliases and functions; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; mode
in the shell was working fine too. The experience till now had been good. The
one thing left to configure: The Prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-prompt&quot;&gt;The Prompt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL; DR&lt;/strong&gt; I couldn’t find the prezto equivalent for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ys&lt;/code&gt;, so I wrote a prompt
that looks exactly like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ys&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ys&lt;/code&gt; because it doesn’t have any crazy characters. The green “o” looks
just as gratifying as the green tick mark. The red “x” is almost
indistinguishable from the red UTF8 “x” mark. One of the main reasons I chose
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ys&lt;/code&gt; was because it has only ASCII characters. That ensures that it looks good
everywhere: Ubuntu, Mac OS, even Windows would have worked fine (if I had ever
tried to make it work there). There was no &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ys&lt;/code&gt; clone for prezto, which was
quite surprising; I was confident I would be able to get away copying some text
around without having to understand how prompts are written. Hard luck there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I started writing this prompt. I copied &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ys&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ysmood.org/my-ys-terminal-theme/&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; over to a file
which I thought would make it work. It was actually surprisingly close to what I
wanted. The colors were off because it seems there’s a slight difference in how
colors are formatted in oh-my-zsh prompts and prezto prompts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oh-my-zsh: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;${$bg[white]on git:%}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prezto:    &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;${%F{white}on git}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oh-my-zsh: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;%{$reset_color%}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prezto:    &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;%f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After changing this around, things started looking very similar! In fact, the
only thing left was the git-related info in the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I realized that I would have to go deeper into the prompt world
or figure out the correct piece of code to copy from an existing prompt module.
I couldn’t make the latter option work, so I decided to delve deeper into
the prompt world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/tree/1f4601e44c989b90dc7314b151891fa60a101251/modules/prompt#prompt&quot;&gt;prompts on prezto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prezto’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vcs_info&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/blob/1f4601e44c989b90dc7314b151891fa60a101251/modules/git/README.md&quot;&gt;git module&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/blob/1f4601e44c989b90dc7314b151891fa60a101251/modules/prompt/functions/prompt_minimal_setup&quot;&gt;prompt theme minimal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/blob/1f4601e44c989b90dc7314b151891fa60a101251/modules/prompt/functions/prompt_sorin_setup&quot;&gt;prompt theme sorin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading all of those READMEs and looking at some of the existing prompt files, I
figured out how the flow of prompt files works. And ended up creating the exact
same thing that I had on oh-my-zsh! And I’m mighty proud of that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-result&quot;&gt;The Result&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At long last, I had reached the point where my prompt looked and worked as I
wanted it to. It was time for the test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; +%s&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ~/.zshrc&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; +%s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, the above command wouldn’t print the time after loading the
shell. So, I measured the time to start a shell by opening a tmux pane or an
iTerm2 tab: &lt;strong&gt;2 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s 4 seconds saved every time I decide to open a new pane in tmux!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fork of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;prezto&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/prezto&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The prezto equivalent of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ys&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/prezto/blob/master/modules/prompt/functions/prompt_ys_setup&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a completely new shell and I am
surprised at how similar it feels to oh-my-zsh and I don’t feel like I have to
make any more changes, already. I might make some minor changes though, because
using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; module brings in a bunch of git-related aliases that I don’t
particularly like having around. (Eg: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gcR&lt;/code&gt; removes the top commit from your
branch. It’s a soft reset and is probably useful, so I might keep that
one around. But there are a bunch of others listed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/blob/1f4601e44c989b90dc7314b151891fa60a101251/modules/git/README.md&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that I
don’t like having around)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;postscript&quot;&gt;Postscript&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been the third project that I have done something real on which will
not get merged into the main project but will only be used by me. I am sort of
having a re-realization about how powerful open-source software is. These are
all fairly small projects. Being able to make these small changes in them to
make your workflow a lot faster and also give you the satisfaction of
understanding the tools you use on a daily basis is pretty empowering. All you
really need to be able to do this kind of thing is a some know-how about the
language that the tool is written in, the time to do it and the motivation to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this on a small scale, also kind of makes me wonder about the power of
being able to do this at a much larger scale: an embedded software engineer’s
ability to make changes in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; library or a Linux kernel developer’s
ability to tweak things to be &lt;em&gt;just so&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>True Detective Season 1</title>
   <link href="/2019/03/10/true-detective-season-1"/>
   <updated>2019-03-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2019/03/10/true-detective-season-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post does not have spoilers about True Detective Season 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2356777/episodes?season=3&quot;&gt;Season 3&lt;/a&gt; started recently, I found myself thinking about what exactly
it was about True Detective season 1 that I liked so much. This post is a look
into what’s great about that season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-plot&quot;&gt;The Plot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A murder mystery in Louisiana that is being investigated by two &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different
detectives: Rust and Marty. Marty is every man’s man; he has a family, two
daughters and some mistakes in his character. He mingles with people well and
has a good rapport with the people he works with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust is single, he has a mysterious past and no one really knows what he did
before coming here. He waxes philosophical almost all the time.  Most of the
people that Rust works with don’t really like him and are unsettled by him.
Early on in the series, we are shown how Rust has insomnia and works through the
night a lot of days. He is also an excellent detective with an uncanny ability
to look through people and situations. One of his most iconic quotes: “I’ve
never been in a room more than 5 minutes and not known whether they did it or
not. How long does it take you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original murder mystery happens in 1995. The two men are being interviewed
in the current time (~2012) about this mystery because something similar has
apparently happened. The series unwinds the complete story of the murder
mystery, how the two men went about investigating that back in ‘95 and it’s
connection to the mystery at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the story. There’s nothing particularly remarkable about the story when
you look at it. The way it is shot and told is extremely well-done. Although, the
story sometimes alternates between the present, the past (‘95) and the more
recent past (2002), I have never felt disoriented about what is going on. Every
single tool that is useful in telling the viewer about the different times is
used effectively and constantly: the lighting, clothes, the characters’ ages,
the characters’ traits and how they change over time. That’s one of the reasons I
like this show: &lt;strong&gt;Despite having a complex plot, the viewer is never disoriented
or disconnected from the characters. We know exactly what is going on, all the
time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next: &lt;strong&gt;Rustin Cohle&lt;/strong&gt;. Rust is the central character in the series. In some
ways, the murder might be the central theme of the show, but Rust is the
driver. He decides where the show goes, he decides the &lt;em&gt;mood&lt;/em&gt; of the show. His
quotes are legendary;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ever seen an impressive character on screen, you know that they are
always charismatic, strong, and have powers that other characters on screen
don’t. Rust has all of this. He is stronger than Marty, he can read people
and never really has to think too much about it. All of these things make
him less and less relatable; he’s depicted to possess super-human abilities. But
there’s a raw human quality to him: From the beginning, his insomnia, his
addiction, his inability to engage socially, some of his traits clearly show how
lonely and tired he is. He talks a lot about existence and it’s usefulness and
how “consciousness was a mis-step in evolution”; you wonder if he’s talking
about all this because he can’t find the point of his own existence. Marty
recounts this when he says to him, “When you talk like that, you sound
panicked”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust is one of the most well-written, well-directed and well-acted characters in
the “investigator” demographic. Another detective I like is Carrie Mathison from
Homeland. She has a lot of the same qualities; minus the existential talk. And,
while Carrie is dealing with stakes that are as high as saving thousands of
people, Rust is working on stopping someone who is hurting a few people. This
smaller focus makes him more human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final dimension to Rust’s character comes from the way people in the show
look at him. They are in the same world and were purposefully written to react
to him the way they do. That gives us the unique perspective of what the
writers wanted Rust to be seen as. Here, one of Maggie’s quotes is very helpful,
“Rust knew exactly who he was and there was no talking him out of it”. She finds
Rust to be someone who knows who he is, who is done figuring out the purpose of
his existence. What’s remarkable is that, Marty, who has spent a lot more time
with Rust doesn’t actually believe that. A superficial look at Rust might lead
us to believe that he has it all figured out (like Maggie believes), but we know
that when Rust talks about himself and from his actions, he is far from that
point of stability and security. There is a duality about him: superficially, he
is a super-hero: he is strong, intelligent, good at his job. Get to know him a
little better, and you realize that he has existential thoughts, his life
revolves around his job, he has trouble figuring out his social purpose. “We are
the bad men who keep other bad men from coming to the door”&lt;/p&gt;

   <link href="/2019/02/06/podcasts-review-jan-2019"/>

   <id>/2019/02/06/podcasts-review-jan-2019</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year! Let’s jump right in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This American Life&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;The Walls&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A fascinating episode! This American Life is one of those podcasts that I
  listen to rarely, but every time I do I end up with an episode that is
  absolute gold! This episode came out at the top of the “Trump shut down the
  government for a wall” news story and debates some of the amazing walls
  around the world. The conclusion is simple: &lt;em&gt;Walls make us feel safe&lt;/em&gt;,
  irrespective of how big they are, whether there’s another wall on the other
  side of the wall on &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; side, whether it actually even exists or has been
  conjured out of nowhere just to pacify us. This episode also follows the
  story of a man who has lived all his life with a wall in his home country; A
  wall that has made his relatives strangers to him and how he reconciles with
  that. &lt;em&gt;Once a wall is built, it becomes a fact of life and affects the way
  life is lived around it&lt;/em&gt; When put like that, we really see how much power
  walls have! An absolutely amazing episode!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Slow Burn&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Season 1: Watergate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Watergate scandal is something that was shrouded in a lot of mystery
  for me before I heard the first season of this podcast. The scandal is
  mentioned so often no matter which country’s news channel you turn on. It’s
  this daring attempt at covering up something that so many people knew that
  anyone who must have looked at it from the outside, in the aftermath, would
  have said: “AH! That could never have been kept under wraps” and yet the
  truth is, that it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; kept under wraps for quite a long time. Listening to
  this podcast really makes you think about what would be discussed as
  &lt;em&gt;history&lt;/em&gt; 50 years from now when other people are analyzing the choices that
  were made by us. A rivetting story that tries to get to the scandal from as
  many angles as possible!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern Love&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;What The Sea Took Away&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This episode talks about how to deal with loss, loss that is inexplicable.
  Loss that doesn’t come with the elusive concept of &lt;em&gt;eventual closure&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern Love&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;A Young Man’s Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An episode about how bearing children is a young man’s game. It’s funny and
  evocative. One of the quotes that stayed with me after I finished listening
  to the episode: “I traveled and I wrote books, and I loved that life.  But I
  truly regret that Larkin hasn’t gotten to know to know my mother, other than
  through our stories”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern Love&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;How To Break Up With a 2 Year-old&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another amazing Modern Love episode! I have really been sucked into this
  podcast, it’s amazing essays and narations! This episode is about how babies
  attach so easily and so effortlessly with adults and even as they grow up to
  forget these adults and how important they were to them as babies, the
  adults keep getting older and realizing more and more how insignificant a
  part they were of this young human being’s life! Heart warming and heart
  breaking, in just a few paragraphs. If you can’t listen to the episode,
  definitely read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wbur.org/modernlove/2018/11/07/how-to-break-up-phillips-sandell&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Podcast Review - December 2018</title>
   <link href="/2019/02/06/podcasts-review-dec-2018"/>
   <updated>2019-02-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2019/02/06/podcasts-review-dec-2018</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; This post is very delayed (it should have been out on December 27th); It
was stored as a note on my iPhone with a set of links. I have added a short
summary of each podcast and why I liked like it other posts in this series.
Let’s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Ethics of Genetically Editing Babies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is related to the story where a Chinese scientist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/health/gene-editing-babies-china.html&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have
  created / helped make (what even is the right word?) the world’s first
  genetically edited babies. After discussing this case and talking about what
  actually happened and why it might be suspect, the guest on this show goes
  on to describe why one or two reckless scientists like this person can
  actually end up forcing countries around the world to heavily regulate or
  even completely stop the research into this field because they don’t trust
  the scientists anymore. I think that that was a very succinct explanation of
  why things like this are bad, while also keeping in mind that more and more
  of the things that we consider impossible in our lifetimes will become
  possible and someone will do them. And our tolerance of innovation might
  very well be defined by our acceptance or rejection of these ground breaking
  events.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;The Business of Selling Your Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nothing new here for anyone who has given thought to how conglomerates like
  Google actually make money (from services like Gmail, Search, Calendar and
  Youtube) which are used for free by most people. This episode does mention
  some companies that collect a lot more than is clearly stated on the app (no
  surprise there) and how that data, if looked at person by person, can create
  a pretty good map of their life: where they live, the restaurants they
  frequent, the people they meet up with, and so on. &lt;strong&gt;P.S.:&lt;/strong&gt; Stop using
  Google and all of it’s products; Pay for e-mail, use an open source browser.
  Those are some of the steps that I have taken to feel better about the
  providers I am using day-in-day-out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Perfect&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;How to be a better carnivore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is a great episode about how eating meat or fish isn’t the worst thing
  in the world. Lately, I feel like there has been this (almost) movement
  among a lot of people to &lt;em&gt;Go Vegan&lt;/em&gt; and how this is somehow because they
  want to save animal life and so on. This episode is absolutely not about
  that. In fact, as the title says, it’s about killing animals that are to be
  consumed with consideration because (a) it’s a good thing to do (b) it
  actually makes fishes taste better (This episode specifically mentions
  fishes in Japan, and having eaten fish in Japan, I can confirm that fish
  dishes in Japan taste great even though they have less than about half the
  spices that a typical fish dish in India would have!)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Perfect&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;How our drinking water could help prevent suicide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another interesting Future Perfect episode: Lithium in the water can reduce
  the number of people who suffer from depression! In fact, “Four of five
  studies reviewed found that places with higher levels of trace lithium had
  lower suicide rates.” There’s a bit of doubt and debate about whether this
  is a real thing or not. Irrespective of that, it is an interesting story and
  connects well to the story of the Fluoride Wars and how one person started a
  movement that convinced almost a whole town that putting Fluoride in the
  water supply is unnecessary and harmful to the residents!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is end of &lt;strong&gt;post 3&lt;/strong&gt; in this series!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Podcast Review - Nov 2018</title>
   <link href="/2018/12/16/novemeber-2018-podcasts-review"/>
   <updated>2018-12-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/12/16/novemeber-2018-podcasts-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post might be about 20 days late, but it sure is packed with some of the
best stuff that I heard in the last month. There’s a lot of foreign policy and
politics related stuff this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Impact&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Plane Crash hospitals vs. Car Crash hospitals&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This episode is about how every single plane crash automatically starts an
  investigation. The investigation eventually leads to a diagnosis of what
  went wrong.  Using this diagnosis, the check lists are updated, new
  processes are introduced to ensure that the chances of the same problem
  causing another accident goes down signficantly. Whereas, car crashes are
  rampant and happen every single day. No investigations are done, and it
  doesn’t seem like the situation is improving. &lt;strong&gt;What happens when a hospital
  applies the Plane crash principal to solve a problem that they realize is
  too big?&lt;/strong&gt; It has a lot of subtle points about authority, ego, and how a
  change in a process, inside any institution, can’t be overnight even if it
  has provably better results.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Impact&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;The Opiod Crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are several podcasts out there about the Opiod crisis in the US right
  now. It’s a very country specific problem and is apparently on the rise in
  Europe too. What I find interesting in this problem is how rampant it has
  gotten before it attracted government attention. How the problem started
  itself is a textbook process of a bunch of sketchy pharma industry people
  getting together and deciding to start a “brain washing” campaign for
  doctors - with all expense paid trips to conferences where they are subtly
  told about how they should treat pain more aggressively. &lt;strong&gt;The Daily&lt;/strong&gt; did a
  2 part series on the people behind the first pharma company that realized
  there was an opportunity here and how despite so many years of
  investigations into this, the people at the top escaped unscathed. &lt;strong&gt;A
  riveting story of how corporate obligations can be met without doing any
  good for society as a whole.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;What the West got wrong about China, parts 1 and 2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another really informative series about the basic assumptions about China
  that the West got wrong: a restricted economy would never prosper. The West
  has always had this obsession with the axiom that “Democracy is the only
  system that succeeds” and now, more and more countries are threatening to
  prove that axiom wrong. As scary as that is, analyzing how exactly this
  happened is probably our best way forward. Another very interesting part of
  the series is where everyone believed that once the Internet becomes more
  popular, it will be impossible for the Chinese government to curb dissent.
  Of course, The Great Firewall came up and instead of the Internet being a
  liberating tool, it was used by the government to spread propaganda!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;What Facebook knew and tried to hide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A short introduction to the decision making process in conglomerates as big
  as Facebook where one person never holds the key and one person can never
  comprehend the size of the operation. The story is framed as some sort of an
  ideological battle between Zuckerberg and Sandberg. I am not sure where that
  comes from, but it definitely casts Zuckerberg in the same light as the
  Social Network movie - the college student who is very brainy but &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt;
  doesn’t understand the business behind Facebook. I think that is
  far-fetched, but nonetheless, this is an interesting listen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything is Alive&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Ana, the Elevator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A new podcast where the host interviews someone playing an inanimate part of
  our lives. It’s weird and &lt;em&gt;cooookie&lt;/em&gt; to begin with, but it definitely grows
  on you. This episode was interesting to me because I recently started
  working in a building where there are about 60 elevators split over 5
  elevator lobbies. These elevators are going up and down &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; second of
  the day, ever since they were installed. And they are privy to so much of
  the people in that building’s habits and conversations. (Not too many
  conversations because Japanese manners &lt;em&gt;frown&lt;/em&gt; on talking in public places -
  trains, elevators)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything is Alive&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Tara, the Bar of soap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My interest in this episode is again personal. Moving from India to Japan, I
  had to give up soap bars and start using Body wash! Thankfully, I was able
  to find body wash of the same brand as I was used to in India. Nonetheless,
  this has a very interesting and confused narration from the Bar of soap
  where she talks about how the less she is being used, the higher her life
  expectancy is. So, while she seems to feel bad that she isn’t being used as
  much anymore, she’s happy she gets to live longer!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today Explained&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Do It for the Gram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A scientific one: this is about how the Kilogram was recently redefined to
  be absolutely measurable by anyone - with enough money, space and motivation
  to actually want that kind of accuracy. Earlier, the definition followed the
  simpler path of having a block that was defined to be 1 kg. &lt;strong&gt;This was again
  one of those awe-inspirin moments when I realized that we have come such a
  long way in these fields where we clearly understand that working together
  with everyone in the world is the only way to solve a problem.&lt;/strong&gt; This time,
  the problem being: standardized measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ezra Klein Show&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Doris Kearns Goodwin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A presidential historian. Given how much of the media cycle and brain space
  American presidents take up in the form of news, movies, podcasts; it’s only
  fair to listen to someone who has spent her time curating stories about
  these people at the very top of civilization and yet somehow very hard to
  understand because, as she begins the podcast with, “You have to be a little
  crazy to want that kind of pressure”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ezra Klein Show&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Haidt&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;And finally, the podcast that I want everyone to hear. I was fairly
  impressed with this conversation. Impressed enough to buy his book the next
  day and read it through the weekend. It was one of the most eye-opening
  books for me. Though I have known for a while that people don’t change their
  political beliefs no matter how much logical arguments you throw at them,
  this was the first book that really spelled out why that was in unambiguous
  language. There’s a lot to decode in the book and I intend to write a review
  and a blog post about that. The podcast is about the recent campus movements
  and where they came from. &lt;strong&gt;There’s this one section of the podcast where they
  discuss how kids nowadays have to be forced to go outside and leave their
  computers and how, in a weird way, it makes them the most well-behaved
  children in the past few decades.&lt;/strong&gt; All they want to do is stay at home and
  chat on the Internet. The podcast is full of revelatory moments like that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is end of post 2 in this series!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Podcast Review - Oct 2018</title>
   <link href="/2018/10/27/podcasts-review-1"/>
   <updated>2018-10-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/10/27/podcasts-review-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The only series on this blog is still the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/tag/#100daysofwriting&quot;&gt;100 days of writing&lt;/a&gt; I did
last year. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/pune-diaries/art/gallery/sheil/2018/07/26/pune-diaries-1/&quot;&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/monthly/music/update/2017/10/07/music-update-august-2017/&quot;&gt;starting&lt;/a&gt; series and never writing the second post in
that series. I really do hope this one is different. Specially because I want to
keep track of the great podcasts that I listen to over the years. In fact, just
to ensure that I get this done, I am adding this to my calendar. It’s a monthly
2 day event (from 27th-29th). I am repeating it for the next 1 year, we will see
how I do then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been listening to a lot more podcasts lately (Courtesy: 30 minute
commute to work and random walks around the streets of Tokyo). And I have
actually heard a lot more great content that I can believe! It has just been one
great episode after another. Seriously. I am not even kidding. I started
listening to the serious Ezra Klein Show at a point where I had run out of Daily
(NYT) episodes. The Daily (NYT) has a huge list of episodes that I absolutely
loved! Here are a few episodes that I highly recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;The War Inside the Catholic Church&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the epic fight between the people who like the current pope (for his
  progressive policies) and a faction inside the church that doesn’t. While
  the sexual harassment revelations last month shook the church from the
  inside, this small faction activated and started working against the Pope in
  this moment when he is the most vulnerable. Of course, this reduces the
  value of the Church as an institution, but &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; remember &lt;em&gt;Mitchell
  Garabedian’s&lt;/em&gt; line from Spotlight (2015): “The church thinks in centuries,
  Mr. Rezendes. Do you think you have the resources to take them on?”
  Remembering this line as I heard this podcast and realized what was going
  on, really sent chills down my spine. (It was also about 18 degrees celsius
  that day)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Lost in the Storm, Parts 1 and 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The heart-breaking story of a family stuck in the middle of a natural
  disaster without the right help from the government and local institutions.
  This was absolutely first-class reporting, done from as objective a
  point-of-view as one can be expected to have when covering a story like
  this. Michael Barbaro and Annie Brown: kudos :applause:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;How the Opiod crisis started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As mind boggling as it is, the opiod crisis was started by a couple of
  people who wanted to make a lot of money quickly. YES. It’s not something
  that just happened. They made the drug; they sent the medical reps across
  the US to convince and coerce doctors into prescribing these medicines;
  That’s how the Opiod crisis started. This episode gave me a really deep look
  into how much of our lives is controlled by Big Pharma.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Roe v. Wade, Parts 1 and 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Again, a landmark issue in politics. These two episodes track the life and
  troubles of Jane Roe, the iconic woman who chose to remain anonymous while
  trying to get an abortion. She isn’t clear about what she wants, she
  flipped, she changed her point of view. “In the end, she was’t claimed by
  either side” - this might just be the saddest way her story ended.
  (Interesting even if you are not interested in the politics of this issue)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;How Trump Really Got Rich&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;What can I even say? I was left gaping at a blank white wall at the end of
  this episode. Everything was explained extremely well; and yet, I ended up
  with just one question: How did they think this up?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;What Migrants Are Fleeing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This connects to another Ezra Klein Show episode that I have heard recently.
  I won’t recommend that episode because the discussion was incoherent and
  didn’t lead anywhere. Ezra Klein himself had some really good quotes in the
  show and that was probably the best part of the episode. I might just pick
  the quotes I liked and post them on Twitter (will update the thread here if
  I do that).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, to understand immigration, it’s important to understand what’s going
  on in their home countries that makes them go to a new country where they
  don’t know anyone. What does it take to force you to leave everything you
  know and are familiar with, to go to a new country, without any kind of
  plan?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;P.S. You should skip this one if you don’t follow this so closely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Truth&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;The Off Season series - Parts 1 through 4&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It’s like a movie, even though it’s only sound, it’s like a movie. An
  amazing story, told through a gripping 4-part narrative with amazing sound
  effects (one of the sound effects is the sound of an egg being broken and
  poured into a bowl for making an omelette. YEAH.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ezra Klein Show&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Why online politics gets so extreme so fast&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The YouTube algorithm has only one goal: to keep users on the site. If it
  figures out that the only way to reliably keep people from leaving is to
  show them something beyond the edge, something edgier than what they are
  used to, it will do that. The problem with edges is that stories involving
  them generally end with someone falling down a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ezra Klein Show&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Jay Rosen is pessimistic about the media. So am I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another essential episode for understanding what the current state of the
  media is. Especially, to people who have been in it for a while (Ezra Klein
  has been a journalist for 15 years). His and Rosen’s take on this issue are
  radical and they come at it from a few different angles. It’s not all
  sunshine and roses. In fact, it’s very dark and gloomy at 12 noon. On the
  brighter side, Rosen and Klein discuss the reasons for this darkness
  pointedly and lucidly. No fancy words here: just the plain, old truth told
  in simple English.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for entry 1 of this series. (Maybe the only way to keep a series up is
to not call them “series”-es in the first place. WAIT, WHAT?)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Moving to Japan</title>
   <link href="/2018/10/20/moving-japan"/>
   <updated>2018-10-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/10/20/moving-japan</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercari.com/about/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/mercari-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;mercari&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it’s been a long time since I talked about what’s going on in my life. I
moved to Tokyo in September. I came here in the third week of September and
started working at Mercari from the 1st week of October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercari is a C2C marketplace (mainly for second hand goods) in Japan. There’s a
Mercari product in the US and UK as well. I got the job in IIT Kharagpur’s
placements in December 2017. Yes, I have been fairly silent on this blog and
everywhere else about the job; primarily because there were a lot of things that
needed to all go well for me to actually start working here. Getting the visa
was one of the main components of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, things did turn out well! The visa part of the process actually
ended up being the least stressful! It’s rather incredible when professionals
are planning your trip to a country, compared to when you have to do all the
planning yourself! (In fact, at the Indian immigration counter, I was asked just
one question: “What is the purpose of your visit?”!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s been three weeks since I joined Mercari. I have finally been assigned
to a team. I don’t have an assignment just yet; I need to be on-boarded onto the
team I am on before I get that. The combination of infrastructure and third
party services that Mercari uses is mind-bloggingly HUGE! My closest experience
to this was at Elanic where we had a single Digital Ocean server with a docker
container for the API and MongoDB and some other containers. We had a dev
environment that could pretty much be setup on your computer after building a
few docker images. So, this is pretty overwhelming right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will probably get more used to it as I run into the potholes that people
generally run into when they are being on-boarded into a new team. I am also
looking forward to working on something that is being used by 100s of thousands
of people! That’s also something I haven’t done before. The gist: A lot of
firsts here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from work, just the experience of living in Japan has been great! It’s a
lot of things, but if I was forced to condense all of that into a single word,
it would be: &lt;strong&gt;CONVENIENT&lt;/strong&gt;. Stores and restaurants are open 24 hours; The
subway runs late; You can get anywhere in Tokyo after a short train ride; The
food has very little in the way of things that are bad for your health: oil,
spices. Of course, the last thing about food can be a con for people who &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;
oily, spicy food!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge reason for moving here, for me, was to experience living in a foreign
country! Food forms a big part of that and I am only getting started on trying
Japanese food. I have tried Sushi, Ramen, Soba and Teishoku meals in a variety
of places with a variety of items in them till now. I definitely want to get
used to Japanese food! I love everything I have tried till now, that’s certainly
&lt;em&gt;VERY&lt;/em&gt; encouraging!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I continue to settle in here, I will keep making blog posts about the things
I used to write about before. There might be more content that’s Japan-related
too though, I don’t think I can quite help that!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Offline Advertising - Familiarity</title>
   <link href="/2018/09/29/offline-advertising-familiarity"/>
   <updated>2018-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/09/29/offline-advertising-familiarity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read a few excellent (albeit old) articles on advertising recently. A few of
them were on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/&quot;&gt;The Doc Searls Weblog&lt;/a&gt;. My main take away from these articles
was that offline advertising is not &lt;em&gt;ineffective&lt;/em&gt; because an ad run on TV is
seen by all sorts of people and is targeted at a cross section of the
population; In fact, it is &lt;em&gt;very effective&lt;/em&gt; because of that very property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently made a cross-country move (more on this in a later post). I wanted to
select a phone contract in the new country. There were several companies and it
was all very confusing. I had two references: a contract that my company’s HR
people recommended and companies that I had heard of before (particularly,
SoftBank and Docomo). I had heard of these companies not because I had used them
before. I had heard of them through old-school advertising!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know the names of a lot of companies whose products we have never used.
That doesn’t mean that the money the companies spent on getting us to know their
names was wasted, OH NO! It only means that the return is more long term than
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In terms of signaling theory in economics (for which Michael Spence won a
Nobel prize), “the firm signals the quality of its product to consumers by its
willingness to spend money on advertising.” (N. Gregory Mankiw: Principles of
Economics, p. 401.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– from &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2016/01/18/rethinking-john-wanamaker/&quot;&gt;Rethinking John Wanamaker&lt;/a&gt; (I highly recommend this article)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when I walk into the huge super market aisle of moisturizers in a foreign
country, I will see a lot of brands on the shelf. But the moment I see Pantene
or Nivea, my brain will make a quick connection and this familiarity will make
it very likely that I buy their products. All this pretty unscientific and
anecdotal; but I am fairly confident that this is how all of us work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never used Pantene’s soaps or Nivea’s creams before, but I have seen
their ads on TV, I have seen big celebrities appear in their ads, so I know that
Pantene spends a whole lot of money on their ads. They probably believe that
their product is genuinely good, or why else would they do that? They could just
get a Google AdWords account and try targetting people whose last search on
Amazon was “moisturizer”.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why I include Bootstrap in every project</title>
   <link href="/2018/09/01/using-bootstrap"/>
   <updated>2018-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/09/01/using-bootstrap</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s some unsolicited advice: &lt;strong&gt;Always start any project with the inclusion of
Bootstrap&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a few reasons I insist on this. I will go into them in
this blog post. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bootstrapbay.com/blog/reasons-to-use-bootstrap/&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.devsaran.com/blog/10-best-reasons-use-bootstrap-amazing-web-designs&quot;&gt;such&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitepoint.com/11-reasons-to-use-twitter-bootstrap/&quot;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; on the Interweb. I
figured that adding my own point of view on this matter will not hurt anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;before-we-begin&quot;&gt;Before we begin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a really hard time understanding what Bootstrap really was. I had some
questions in mind: Is it a library? Is it a set of CSS classes? Is it jQuery,
but better? Why is jQuery required if it is only a set of CSS classes? I have
figured out a very simple way to explain what Bootstrap is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Bootstrap is a set of 2 components. 

Bootstrap CSS is a set of CSS classes that
can be used in any application. It does some great things by default (like using
a good font, using margins and paddings on the `body` tag). It has 2 major
features which are worth using in any app that aims for a simplistic polished
look: the grid system and the classes that make forms render better

Bootstrap JS is a library built on top of jQuery that provides some more
functionality. 2 of the best features of Bootstrap JS are: tooltips and
modals.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing. Bootstrap has really &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction&quot;&gt;good documentation&lt;/a&gt;. The documentation
is really really good. It was good already. And then they added the search
feature with Bootstrap v4’s release. It became GREAT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reasons&quot;&gt;Reasons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are in decreasing order of significance, as I have experienced in my
frontend development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bootstrap makes your website responsive. i.e. your app will look better on
every screen no matter it’s size and shape. Of course, you should use it
properly. But it is extremely hard to use bootstrap badly enough that it will
look bad somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bootstrap’s Grid System. This is one of the most useful things that I have
EVER learnt in frontend development. Every line of HTML I write now is
written in the context of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;col-md-*&lt;/code&gt;s and so on. Learn this grid system and
you will forever lose your fear of center aligning text in HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bootstrap makes your site look better. The new font, the sane defaults for
margins around various elements. These things have become standards across
the web and including a CSS library which will take care of this is a huge
load off your shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bootstrap makes your forms easier to understand and fill. The rounded
corners, the highlighting when a particular text field is selected, the
amazing UI bump that it gives to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; lists. All of these things can’t be
done with custom CSS. &lt;strong&gt;Stand on the shoulders of giants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bootstrap’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;table&lt;/code&gt;s will finally make tables better on the web. 3 classes
that I always use with a table are the default &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;table&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;table-hover&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;table-striped&lt;/code&gt;. These three classes make the table resemble an Excel sheet
to some extent and actually make the app easier to comprehend. Tables are a
very powerful way to show information, perhaps second only to bar charts.
Bootstrap makes it easier for developers to make more legible tables for
their users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bootstrap’s buttons convey information. Almost everything in Bootstrap comes
in a set of colors, depending on the “alert” level. This color is extremely
useful when developing dashboard type applications. It’s also pretty useful
when developing normal applications that tend to have destructive actions
(like deleting your account or deleting a cutout). I used this in a former
intern where I was upgrading a dashboard application written using an Angular
library and the buttons were so small that it was only the colors that any
user even looked at. That’s how helpful this is!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bootstrap makes your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blockquote&lt;/code&gt; look better. Blockquote tags are again
great ways to convey information especially when writing blog posts or some
sort of a reference. Goodreads doesn’t use bootstrap and their blockqotes
look really bad. Blockquotes look like text that has been indented, instead
of looking like quoted text.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus&lt;/strong&gt; Bootstrap gives you the ability to add a navbar quickly. The
Bootstrap navbar is extremely toned down. I don’t like it in all settings,
but for some apps where you can’t do away with the navbar, Bootstrap is the
way to go. The navbar has a set of options that enable you to do anything
with it: stick it to the bottom of the page, show only one option on mobile
screens, anything you want really.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus&lt;/strong&gt; Bootstrap Modals! I mean, this is something everyone loves. I don’t
like modals because they are very hard to use on mobile and I tend to stay
away from them as much as I can. I would rather enable the user to scroll
through the page rather than have to struggle to get to the small X button at
the top of a modal. But if you are developing an application that’s used only
on desktop computers (like a Sales Dashboard), modals are extremely powerful
tools to retain context and let the user edit information at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>My Values</title>
   <link href="/2018/08/18/my-values"/>
   <updated>2018-08-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/08/18/my-values</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My friend Kshitij Saraogi just released his website’s code on GitHub and I
happened to &lt;a href=&quot;http://kshitij10496.github.io/&quot;&gt;visit it&lt;/a&gt;. His website had a very intriguing tab: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VALUES&lt;/code&gt;. It
immediately led me to question myself what my values were? What were the things
that helped me navigate through decision making and just life in general?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intend to list out a few of my values here. This list is bound to grow and I
think I will keep adding / removing things from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last updated 18th August, 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be decisive, without being impulsive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower your expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do the right thing. Your experience will tell you what the right thing to do
in every situation is, just follow that instinct.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not regret past decisions. You did what felt right in the moment, don’t
second guess yourself or others in retrospect.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t over-analyze the future. Go with the flow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try everything, within reasonable limits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When in a dilemma, talk to more people. But take the decision yourself.
Whatever it is, you are the one who must live with it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are hopelessly stuck, while solving a problem: take a break. Get
perspective about what is going on and how you ended up there. This won’t
always help you solve the problem or even move closer to the solution, it
will atleast give your brain time to recuperate and work at it’s full
strength when you return.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t plan a vacation/trip down to the hour. Have a rough plan in your mind,
everything else tends to work itself out once you are there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Travel far and wide. Choose unorthodox places to go to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read a variety of books and read constantly. Take notes when you think
something is important and return to these notes in times of doubt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you need something and it isn’t being sold, build it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be organized. Clutter adds stress, you don’t need that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Live according to the routine that suits you best. For me, this is waking up
early, going to bed early, eating food at the right times and avoiding junk
food whenever possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t drink alcohol or coffee or other caffeinated drinks during travel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eat safe when you travel. Listen to your body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk and mingle freely with people. Most people can tell you many stories
about their life that you will never find out if you don’t put in the effort
to go out and spend time getting to know them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trust yourself to be able to figure things out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Document the present.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk is cheap. Do not spend too much time discussing personal choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Media and Expectations - Part 2 - Indian Railway Accidents</title>
   <link href="/2018/08/17/news-media-expectations-2"/>
   <updated>2018-08-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/08/17/news-media-expectations-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part 2 of a two part series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/news/series/2018/07/30/news-media-expectations-1/&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; · &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/news/series/2018/08/17/news-media-expectations-2/&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As promised at the end of Part 1, I will list the number of people who were
affected by these incidents that were heavily reported on in the Indian news
media to the point where I was actually wondering whether it was even safe to
travel in the Railways anymore. If I had only had a look at the numbers I am
going to show you, I would never have had that fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full data can be found &lt;a href=&quot;/public/data/indian-railway-accidents.ods&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The sources are listed at the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s look at the list of deaths and injuries over a period of 5 years
starting 2010 and ending 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEATHS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INJURIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2010&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;222&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;464&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;128&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;540&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;94&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;89&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;75&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;81&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;69&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;181&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;110&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;420&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;153&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;382&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;67&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;360&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOTAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;918&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2517&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s less than a thousand deaths and about 2500 injuries over a period of 8
years. &lt;em&gt;Including&lt;/em&gt; the year in which there were so many reports about
derailments and problems. How dangerous is travelling in the Indian Railways?
One number will reassure you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, Indian Railways carries more than &lt;a href=&quot;/public/data/indian-railway-usage.pdf&quot;&gt;8 billion passengers&lt;/a&gt;. Out of them,
in their worst year, 222 people died. That’s an incredibly small number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For comparison, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2015/GSRRS2015_data/en/&quot;&gt;WHO estimated&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 that about 207,000 people die each
year because of road accidents in India. Put another way, an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;/public/data/indian-road-safety-who-a2.pdf&quot;&gt;17
people die&lt;/a&gt; among 100,000 inhabitants each year. That is way way more than
the total number of people who die in railway accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, trains are far safer than road travel. And air travel just had the safest
year, last year. So, flights are safer than trains. There’s no need to feel
panicked by the numbers that are being shown on TV every time a train derails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every step should be taken to bring this number down to zero. But realize that
this is a safe mode of transport. That’s the take-away here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My argument is that these numbers should have been part of every single story on
TV about this topic. Isolated numbers make no sense to a viewer. When you show
them the same numbers with context and a total that they can divide it by, they
will realize how important the number is. I probably don’t need to explain this,
but I want to be sure I am understood here. Say there is a fictional elevator
and you want to find out how dangerous it is to get on it. You know this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On average, 2 people have gotten injured every single week for the past 8 weeks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if the elevator is used by only 10 people in a week, that’s very alarming.
You should probably not get on the elevator and take the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if it’s a big building where several people work and it’s used nearly
100,000 times or more, you don’t need to worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case, it’s very important that you find the problem and fix it. But
institutions tend not to be very fast about solving some problems that are
logistically complicated. In that case, you need to be able to make a realistic
estimate of the danger you will be in when you make a decision. To do that, you
need all the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, everyone who reports news, please please please mention the context next
time you report a number. Mention the total, compare it to a similar number,
help your audience understand the number you are reporting. You are doing a job
that’s more important than the ratings your show gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; Do watch the TV show &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1870479/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot;&gt;The Newsroom
(2012)&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a really
great story about what the business of reporting news is really about.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part 1 of a two part series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/news/series/2018/07/30/news-media-expectations-1/&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; · &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/news/series/2018/08/17/news-media-expectations-2/&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am fresh off the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness&quot;&gt;Factfulness&lt;/a&gt; dose. The authors articulate one thing about
the news media:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;I cannot even see the highest-quality news outlets conveying a neutral and
non-dramatic representative picture of the world, as statistics agencies do. It
would be correct but just too boring. We shouldn&apos;t expect the media to move very
far in that direction. Instead it is up to us as consumers to learn how to
consume the news more factfully, and to realize that the news is not very useful
for understanding the world
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me to thinking about how much I have complained about the Indian news
media in the past: the unnecessary sensationalization of stories, the shouting,
the talking head shows that run throughout the day with a macho news anchor who
is shouting the populist opinion (whatever that might be), generalizations. I
realized that they were pandering to every single instinct mentioned in
Factfulness. A quick summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/news-media-11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The gap enables the &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt; people to hide information and fool the
majority of people who are not powerful&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Negative&lt;/em&gt; news stories only: deaths, harassment, lynchings, bans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 bad things happened last month? Expect 6 more this month, 9 the next month
and so on! Things will only go downhill from here!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be afraid&lt;/em&gt; of the powerful people and the authority figures because you
might be the next victim. Don’t let them tell you how to live.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blow&lt;/em&gt; things &lt;em&gt;wayyyy&lt;/em&gt; out of proportion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generalize everything across state identities, religions, nationalities,
communities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bad things happen in this state or the other and have for years, it’s stupid
to expect change from the people in power because they want to maintain the
status quo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s only one view of every single story: the news anchor’s view&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blame&lt;/em&gt; the first person who is accussed and conduct a media trial
immediately and declare that the person is guilty&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You MUST ACT NOW!&lt;/em&gt; Tweet us, use this hashtag, sms us, call in and express
your opinions, do it &lt;em&gt;RIGHT NOW!&lt;/em&gt;, where else will you be heard! Time is
flying by as is obvious from the 10 moving elements on your TV screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you watch a nightly news show on Indian TV, look out for these
instincts. You will find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a rant. I am not blaming anyone here. I have done what’s in my
power: I have stopped watching these news shows. I have told every single person
who says they watch these programs about how they are run, about why they should
stop watching these programs and instead read or watch videos on YouTube. If
they are still interested in news, videos by channels like Vox and Vice News. If
not, there are enough cat videos to fill your heart to the brim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth:&lt;/strong&gt; There are always enough cat videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news business runs on advertisements. Shows that get eyeballs, get ads and
make money. Every segment should keep the viewer glued to the screen, it should
make them want more, it should ensure that they don’t reach for that remote. So,
the first thing we need to do is to stop blaming news channels for the things
they choose to run. It’s what the consumers watch, it’s what they get ads for.
It’s not their fault, it’s the business model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like that Zach Holman talk[FN1] about the HR department in every company. The HR
department works keeping the company’s interests in mind. Similarly, the news
media works keeping the advertisers interests in mind, not the consumers. As
soon as you understand that, you can start correcting for it. You can understand
why a particular story is being run. You can understand the other side of the
story, what the news producer was thinking when they approved the script for the
opening lines by the news anchor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the YouTube channels. I can vouch for only two: Vox and Vice News. They put
out videos that help you &lt;em&gt;understand the world&lt;/em&gt;. The content that Vox puts out
is amazing! It’s backed by facts and is solid to the core. There is no
sensationalism. There are no unnecessary graphics, in fact, the graphics are
kept to the absolute minimum. The graphics help you understand the video and
don’t distract you. Vox doesn’t ask you to tweet to them, to use a hashtag. They
don’t ask you to do something, they simply explain the things that are. What’s
the advantages that YouTube has over TV?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People don’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to watch:&lt;/strong&gt; They have a lot of content to choose from. TV
on the other hand is limited. During prime time, 9 pm to 10 pm, all Tamil TV
channels run bad reality shows. If you are not into sports and don’t want to
watch a movie along with your dinner, your only option are news channels.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no primetime:&lt;/strong&gt; Your content is out there, forever. It can be
watched all over the world. It can be reviewed, people can call you out if
you made a mistake. The bad part is that the people who watch your videos
will also see your mistake. But TV doesn’t support criticism. You would have
to criticise a TV show on the Internet and how many people who watch a show
will see your YouTube video or blog post especially if you are just a normal
guy?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ad revenue is directly tied to the number of people who watch your
content:&lt;/strong&gt; On TV, it’s not the number of people who watch but the rating of
your TV show. As the TV regulatory agency put it very well in a report I read
and analyzed on this blog a few weeks ago, ratings decide the content that
gets made and ratings are collected from a sample of the population. No one
can measure exactly how many people really watched a show. They can only
measure how many people in the sample watched that particular show. These are
the numbers that big companies who want to run ads on these shows get. On
YouTube, you get the exact number of people who watched every single video.
The demographics of each video’s viewers, the country that the video is
popular in, and so on! All of this extra information is a boon for
advertisers who can target exactly the people they want. So, channels like
Vox must make a huge variety of high quality content. That’s the reason there
are so many types of Vox videos: Almanac, Atlas, the series about Pop
culture, the series about things that are hyped up, the amazing Emmy
nominated Vox Borders!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diverse and prolonged viewership:&lt;/strong&gt; TV shows are available for one hour a
day to 1 billion people. There are no re-runs of talking head shows, there is
no value in re-running them because the information that they were trying to
dissipate is old the minute after the show aired for the first time.
Producers don’t have to make the show re-watchable, they just have to make
the show sensational enough to make people watch it once. And not “people”,
just the people who are part of the sample which contributes to the ratings.
I don’t think there’s any way to actually influence the sample but not
everyone else, still, it’s one less thing to worry about. Vox video producers
on the other hand have to worry about making the video watchable, shareable.
There is nothing better than a personal, trusted recommendation. They have to
make the video good enough to stick around forever and be re-watchable by a
ton of people around the world. That’s why most Vox videos have closed
captions in a few languages, that’s why the voice over is never messy or
unclear, that’s why the graphics are never distracting. (That is my
assumption)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said in a sentence: &lt;em&gt;Businesses do what they have to do to excel at their
business model&lt;/em&gt;. Both TV shows and YouTube content creators need to get as many
eyeballs as they can. But the set of constraints is different. TV shows need to
be appealing for a short period of time, they needn’t have re-watch value, and
they need to attract the people in the TRP sample. YouTube content creators need
to make content that’s worth watching atleast once and preferably several times,
the content should be shareable and should reflect the type of all content on
that channel, it should be true because people can call you out on your mistakes
and your viewers are right there watching out for such call outs. They each work
to excel at their business model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was part 1 of a 2 part series on Media and Expectations - TV v. Internet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 2 will cover a particular case of Factfulness. A short synopsis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Indians will remember the stories about train derailments during the months
of May 2017 to August 2017, there were nearly 9 accidents. There was a huge
uproar on the over-use of Indian Railways infrastructure and several thousands
of column inches and TV show hours were spent debating and discussing this. The
problem with each show was the same, they presented one number: the number of
accidens, deaths and injuries that had happened in the past 3 months. There was
no number to compare it to. In part 2, I will try to figure out what the numbers
really are and then compare them to older numbers. I picked this problem at
random because it affected the way I think about the safety of trains. I don’t
know what the outcome will be yet, I am still collating data. Either way, I
think it will be a worthwhile experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FN1:&lt;/strong&gt; The talk is called &lt;em&gt;Getting Fired&lt;/em&gt; and it’s a great way to spend 45
minutes of your time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pune Diaries 1 - Art Gallery</title>
   <link href="/2018/07/26/pune-diaries-1"/>
   <updated>2018-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/07/26/pune-diaries-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last 5 years, I lived in Kharagpur, West Bengal. It is a town, no more
no less. There’s nothing to expect there, and it lives up to that expectation. A
movie theater started flourishing in my last year there. Apart from that, there
was &lt;em&gt;nothing to do&lt;/em&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After those 5 years, and even in between during Summer and Winter vacations, I
was in various cities: Chennai, Bangalore, Coimbatore briefly. But I never &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;
anything that I was unhappy about being unable to do when I was in Kharagpur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I am in Pune until the first week of September. I am in the training period
for a job, and my weekdays are not free in any sense of the word. My weekends
though, are free and I would like to use them well. And hence, this is a new
series on this blog which will follow me around this city as I do the things I
was unable to do in a town like Kharagpur. Some weeks this stuff is bound to be
boring, but I will try to keep it as interesting as I can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/pune-diaries-12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, I visited the Art2Day Gallery in Pune to see the exhibition
The Power of Point. The exhibition is a collection of ball point pen drawings by
Sheil Sadwelkar. I read about it first in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://punemirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/unwind/pen-mode/articleshow/64994024.cms&quot;&gt;Pune Mirror&lt;/a&gt;. The thing that
intrigued me most about this form of art was that ball point pens are
notoriously difficult to erase. In pencil sketches, and even in paintings, there
is some margin for error. But ball point pen drawings completely remove this
margin for error. The drawing must be right the first time, or you must start
all over again. That is a great sort of finality, and I wanted to see what the
subjects of these drawings were and how they affected me when I saw them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I am not an &lt;em&gt;art buff&lt;/em&gt;. This caught my eye and I decided to go.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk from the place I stay to Art2Day was pleasant and took me through some
quiet parts of Pune. It was about 4 pm and there was a slight drizzle. I went
right in front of the Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce’s front gate (I
think it was the front gate)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drawings were really good! I was completely taken aback by the detail and
intricacy in each of the paintings. Three paintings really caught my attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Final Destination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular painting had a road that wasn’t visible after some distance. It
disappeared behind a mountain of some sort. This appealed to me as such an
appropriate analogy for daily life! Everyday, the problems that I face in that
day, week or month seem like the largest I have ever faced and will ever face. A
few months down the line, everything seems to make a lot more sense. In general,
it’s like that famous quote: “Life can only be understood in retrospect, but you
must live it in the other direction”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was unable to find an image of this painting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plastic Bonsai&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Candyfloss River&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout several of the drawings, the common thread is the use of parallel
lines to suggest density. For example, the ground is densely packed with
vertical lines in the background, and over that the subject is drawn, roots in
these paintings with trees. And as the ground reaches sky, the densite of these
vertical lines reduces and suggest the beginning of air. This is absolutely
mesmerizing to watch, because the first time I saw these drawings I didn’t even
notice these in the background. Only on close observation did I realize that the
effect of these lines was perceived automatically and there was no conscious
effort required to think about them! &lt;em&gt;FREAKING AMAZING!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sheilsadwelkar.com/fullscreen-page/comp-jg9asnel/af18d31c-d72b-4155-9b56-8c70e347aede/1/%3Fi%3D1%26p%3Db16sa%26s%3Dstyle-jgofcjb7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/pune-diaries-11.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eyes One&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Eyes at Visarajan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trick that pervades all of the art art these small curves that seem to
be connected. They are clearly visible in any of the paintings with trees where
the density of leaves and the suggestion of being hollow or filled is shown
clearly using the density and the closeness of these curls. In some places they
are small and dense, whereas in other places they are farther apart and create
the near-solid background in some drawings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the paintings mentioned above, I especially liked &lt;em&gt;Fuji Bypass&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;Fallen in Love&lt;/em&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition ended today. So, I can’t really tell you to go see the paintings
this time. The exhibtion is sure to continue somewhere else. If you are ever in
the city where these paintings are being shown, definitely find a way to see
them! It was a great experience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; Some of the paintings can be found online &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sheilsadwelkar.com/the-shades&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEEK 1 OF PUNE DIARIES IS OVER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Donna Tartt</title>
   <link href="/2018/07/03/donna-tartt"/>
   <updated>2018-07-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/07/03/donna-tartt</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primer:&lt;/strong&gt; Donna Tartt is a 53-year old writer from Mississippi. She has
written only three novels and she released them in 1992, 2002 and 2013. Each of
those novels is nearly 600 pages long. She rarely gives any interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/1013102545999310848&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2018-07-01-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of my major goals for this summer. I had already read The Secret
History by Tartt and after reading that book, I seriously believed that she was
an author unlike anyone I had ever read. Some thoughts from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1470325810&quot;&gt;right after&lt;/a&gt; I
finished the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;An attrocious act, on the face of it, but surprisingly towards the end, I was
empathising with their situation, and although, I feel that this may not have
been the best course, I can&apos;t question the decision that they made to kill their
friend. That, only because of some really involved and amazing writing!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was in December 2015, nearly 30 months ago. Both her other books: The
Goldfinch and The Little Friend are 700 pages long and I have found some great
excuses in these 30 months to never pick them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer (the first after finishing college), I was determined to finish one
of these books. I was confident that if I didn’t finish this book right now, and
tried to pick it up after I started working, I would almost certainly never read
this book. That wasn’t acceptable to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after reading The Goldfinch, I realized that Tartt is really something.
I couldn’t let her third and only book I hadn’t read left unread. So, once again
I started reading her third and final novel. Now, I have read all three of her
books and I can’t be more happy that I decided to spend this time on her books
because they have been a lot more than just another novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t choose a favourite Tartt novel (I know, it’s &lt;em&gt;cliché&lt;/em&gt; to say that). It’s
because I look at her work as a whole. All three of her novels (and anything
else she releases later) seem to be a part of the same treatise: A treatise
about life, drugs, beliefs, people and unused time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all three novels, the inciting event is a fairly content protagonist who does
something unconventional. Something that they can’t or aren’t willing to explain
to the reader. Why did Richard change his major to the classics? Why did Theo
take the painting out of the museum? Why did Harriet feel so obsessed over
finding out the real story behind Robin’s death? I like to think that they did
these things because they were meandering, they didn’t know where they were
going and needed to do something, good or bad, that would set in concrete the
path they would set out on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stories of Richard, Theo and Harriet go through a lot of stunning twists and
turns. One doesn’t believe a 12 year old capable of stealing a snake and
attempting to kill someone. One doesn’t believe someone could steal a 400 year
old painting from a museum and never see it once, for a whole decade! There is
no lowest common multiple that binds these stories together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But somehow, they still feel connected.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Landing pages on TV</title>
   <link href="/2018/05/30/landing-pages-tv"/>
   <updated>2018-05-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/05/30/landing-pages-tv</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One fine Monday evening, I was absent mindedly scrolling through Twitter, which
was when I came across this tweet from TRAI, the Telecom Regulator in India:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Stakeholders sharing their views on Landing Page Issues in Open House
Discussion on Consultation Paper on &amp;#39;Issues related to placement of TV
channel on landing page&amp;#39; at TRAI HQ, New Delhi &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TRAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@TRAI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/6ZQPKMkitk&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/6ZQPKMkitk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; TRAI
(@TRAI) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TRAI/status/1001050391495163904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May
28, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understandably, I was confused. Mainly, I wasn’t sure this topic needed such a
formal open house discussion which no doubt made executives from the stakeholder
companies fly to Delhi to sit in and make sure their voices were heard. So, I
retweeted this and forgot about it. A few minutes later, Abinash replied to my
tweet and set of a chain of events that had a very agreeable ending!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What?
Did you make sense of it later? :P&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Abinash Meher (@beenharsh) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/beenharsh/status/1001061856486674433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May
28, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when you turn on the Set-Top Box, there is a channel that shows up. This
channel is the &lt;em&gt;landing page&lt;/em&gt; of the STB and apparently, STB distributors
(think, Tata Sky) and broadcasters (think, Sony) were eager to put content that
they wanted their customers to watch on this channel. This is a great marketing
strategy, and TRAI wouldn’t necessarily come in to stop that if it was just
that. There is actually a slightly more impactful effect if a distributor gets a
particular channel onto their landing channel: it’s rating increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this, we need to understand how TRP is measured. There are meters
that are installed in particular houses which are selected to have a good mix of
demography (age-group, gender), viewing time, etc. The TRP meter, the
&lt;em&gt;Bar-O-meter&lt;/em&gt;, captures the TV’s audio. Every channel’s audio has a fingerprint
that probably has information related to what channel it is. So, the meter can
capture which channel the user is watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another slightly more delicate detail is that the measuring is done at the
resolution of clock minutes. So, whichever channel is viewed for more than 30
seconds in a given clock minute gets the credit for that complete clock minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when the TV is switched on, and say, NDTV is the landing channel, the
Bar-O-Meter will start picking up that the user is watching NDTV. If the viewing
time in this particular clock minute exceeds 30 seconds, then NDTV will get a
minute of watch time that the user didn’t really ask for. In fact, it was purely
incidental and any channel in NDTV’s place would have been able to get that
watch time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this is not desirable. The reason that TRAI gives in their consultation
paper is incredibly and something to very deeply think about. It was nothing
short of a revelation when I read and understood what their justification really
meant. This is what it was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.9 With  the  growth  in  the  number  of  channels  and  increasing  variety
of programmes  available,  the  task  of  both  broadcasters  and  advertisers
in   allocating   resources   becomes   increasingly   difficult.   Mark et
segmentation and targeting have become vital in such a scenario.  On the  basis
of  audience  measurement  data,  ratings  are  assigned  to various programmes
on television. Television ratings in turn influence content  and  programmes
produced  for  the  viewers.  Better  ratings would  promote  a  programme
while  poor  ratings  will  discourage  a Page 8 of programme  or  content.
Incorrect  ratings  will  lead  to  production  of content  which  may  not  be
really  popular , while  good  content  and programmes may be left out. False
and  misleading ratings, therefore, can  affect  not  only  broadcasters  and
advertisers  but  also  the  viewing public   as   well.   Therefore,   there
is   a   need   to   have   accurate measurement    and    representative    te
levision    ratings    for    the programmes.  Placement  of  television
channels  on  multiple  LCNs obliterates   the   above   said   objective   of
the   TRP   guidelines   and measurement.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, whenever someone turns their TV on and either waits for some time to switch
channels or else looks through their programme guide trying to decide what to
watch, these clock minutes will be added to the rating of the landing page
channel. That’s the reason TRAI passed a direction in November 2017 asking
distributors to not place any TV channel whose viewership is being measured on
their landing channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.11 ... After  due  consideration and deliberation with stakeholders , the
Authority issued a direction dated 8th November,  2017  wherein  it was directed
that all  the  broadcasters and  distributors  of  television channels,  to
restrain  from  placing  any registered  satellite  television channel,  whose
TV  rating  is  released  by TV  rating  agency,  on  the landing  LCN  or
landing  channel  or  boot  up screen.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/Direction_BnCS_08112017.pdf&quot;&gt;Full text of this
direction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This direction was apparently only a temporary solution, and TRAI has now set
out to solve this once and for all. I do admire the structured methodology with
which they have set out to solve a problem that appears to be rather trivial at
first glance, but is everything but!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;auxilliary&quot;&gt;Auxilliary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is the issue of updating technology and how it is handled by a
bureaucratic organization such as TRAI. This is an interesting study of what
happens when technology moves forward faster than the law was able to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in 2004, they released the first Interconnection Regulations, which dealt
with how distributors should inter operate with each other when they transmit
analog signals (Cable TV).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2012, they released the second Interconnection Regulations, which dealt
with digital addressable systems that are being used now. The digitization of
the TV services sector was started in June 2012 and &lt;em&gt;austensibly&lt;/em&gt; completed in
March 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this completion of digitization, TRAI notified everyone that
Interconnection Regulations 2017 is to be followed now and that the 2004 and
2012 versions have been repealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, this is where the twist is. &lt;strong&gt;DUH DUH DUUUUUH&lt;/strong&gt; These 2017 regulations are
sub-judice in many courts across the country! So, you can’t apply them just yet.
TRAI has to wait for all the court cases to end and only after that can they
apply these regulations. Until then, the old regulations (2004 and 2012) will
remain in force!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s entirely possible that by the time these 2017 regulations can be
applied, the next TV technology is already out there and becoming popular and
the whole cycle will start over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reading-material&quot;&gt;Reading material&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_03042018.pdf&quot;&gt;The Consultation
Paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Particularly, you should definitely read the sections 2.9-2.11 which detail how
  TRP is measured. It was very educative to finally understand how TRP was
  measured, although I still don’t know how they go from the measured clock
  minutes to the actual TRP ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trai.gov.in/events/open-house-discussion/ohd-consultation-paper-issues-related-placing-television-channel&quot;&gt;The Open House discussion
notification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tl-dr&quot;&gt;TL; DR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you turn on your Set-Top Box, a default channel will show up on your TV.
  This is called the landing channel or the landing page of the TV&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When not regulated, landing channels can be used by distributors and
  broadcasters, to artificically, increase the ratings of their channels; this
  is a direct consequence of the methodology used to measure TRP ratings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inaccurate TRP ratings are bad because when there are so many channels, TV
  ratings determine what sort of content is produced by TV channels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hence, we should ensure that what appears on the landing page should be
  something that makes the experience of the customer better, &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; having
  any ability of favorably or unfavorably affecting the TRP ratings of any
  other channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THAT&lt;/em&gt; was the reason for the consultation paper, the consultation process and
the subsequent open house discussion. I hope it makes sense now.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>OpenSSL is extensive and amazing</title>
   <link href="/2018/05/25/openssl-is-awesome"/>
   <updated>2018-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/05/25/openssl-is-awesome</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in August 2017, I hadn’t yet dipped my feet into OpenSSL’s command line
yet. That’s when I ended up finding out about a set of OpenSSL commands that
have a solution for most cryptography related requirements. Secondly, it’s a
great way to just explore and find out about new technologies.  So, here’s a
list of commands that absolutely floored me when I first found out about them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-openssl-x509&quot;&gt;1. openssl x509&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;openssl x509 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-in&lt;/span&gt; ~/Downloads/twittercom.crt &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-text&lt;/span&gt; | less
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command inspects x509 certificates from the internet. Firefox has a great
certificate inspector, but for every field, you have to go and highlight it and
then the value for that field will be shown in the bottom. This on the other
hand shows up in gorgeous less and works like a charm! I have learned so much
about TLS just reading the certificates for the top sites that I keep visiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For eg: &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.9&quot;&gt;Basic Constraints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dhSN9aEljg&quot;&gt;Moxie’s talk about defeating SSL using
it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-openssl-rand&quot;&gt;2. openssl rand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;openssl rand &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-hex&lt;/span&gt; 40
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;openssl rand &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-base64&lt;/span&gt; 40
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you wanted to generate some random bytes quickly? OpenSSL
can do it! I don’t know what the distribution of this is, or what it uses as a
seed or any of that, but it just seems to work and that’s great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-openssl-s_client&quot;&gt;3. openssl s_client&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl s_client &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-connect&lt;/span&gt; duckduckgo.com:443 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-tls1_2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-showcerts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opens a TLS 1.2 tunnel with the destination site and then allows you to
send some data on this newly created encrypted tunnel. This command also shows
all the options explicitly and lets you inspect each handshake. This was pretty
helpful when I was writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siddharthkannan.in/tls-handshake/&quot;&gt;tls-handshake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-openssl-enc&quot;&gt;4. openssl enc&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# the command to encrypt a file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;openssl enc &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-in&lt;/span&gt; 404.html &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-out&lt;/span&gt; 404.html.enc &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-k&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;testing123&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-aes-256-ctr&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# the command to decrypt the encrypted file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;openssl enc &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-in&lt;/span&gt; 404.html.encrypted &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-out&lt;/span&gt; 404.html.new &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-k&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;testing123&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-aes-356-ctr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command comes in pretty handy if you want to send a huge file to someone
using something like Google Drive or Dropbox (a vendor that you don’t trust to
not look into your data). Put everything in a tarball, encrypt it using AES,
then send the encryption key to the recipient using another channel (such as
&lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt;) and the encrypted data using the cloud storage service. I haven’t
really gone into it’s performance aspects, but it’s a pretty cool command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you could use the same cloud storage provider to share the key if you
have the public key of the recipient. You could use something like PGP or simple
SSH RSA keys (if they are long enough).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; You can use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openssl rand&lt;/code&gt; function to generate a secure key
that’s a few 100 bytes long and can’t be brute forced for the forseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the drawbacks of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openssl enc&lt;/code&gt; is that AEAD ciphers aren’t supported in
the version of OpenSSL I have (1.0.2g 1 March 2016) (eg: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aes-256-gcm&lt;/code&gt;). There
is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/471&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; discussion on github about this. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/5048&quot;&gt;this PR&lt;/a&gt; that says &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;enc&lt;/code&gt;
will not support AEAD in the future. It says to look into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linux.die.net/man/1/cms&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; utility.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Futility of Surprise Tests</title>
   <link href="/2018/04/14/surprise-tests"/>
   <updated>2018-04-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/04/14/surprise-tests</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S.&lt;/em&gt; I had my masters thesis presentation today. I started writing this on
14th April, but of course I didn’t get around to publishing it. After a month
and a half without a post, I don’t even think I can make a proper excuse. But I
am done with college, and I am going to be free till the second week of July and
there will be regular posts until then. (I am thinking twice a week.
Forced-sort, so that I don’t have the choice to not write. Kind of like a short
re-run of 100 days of writing.  Enough blabbering, on to the post now)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has been a student in India for more than 10 years will know that
surprise quizzes are the oldest tool in the teacher’s arsenal. It is wielded
whenever a teacher feels that they are not being given due respect or the
students are &lt;em&gt;taking the course too lightly&lt;/em&gt; or (and this is the best) &lt;strong&gt;when a
teacher feels that their students are not studying regularly&lt;/strong&gt;. How sharp is
this tool? And consequently, how far into the bulletproof vest of a not
up-to-date student does it enter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has been a student anywhere also knows that very few people study
regularly. So, what’s the point of Surprise tests really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some context: A few weeks ago, a surprise test was conducted. I had sort-of
flaked out on the classes and I had some notes, but I mainly didn’t know much.
This was the &lt;em&gt;post mid term&lt;/em&gt; surprise quiz, I knew the pre-mid-term stuff well
but nothing after that. Surprisingly, for me, I got the correct answer for both
questions! It was really incredible. That was when the question came up. If I
was able to get both questions right, what did the test screen for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things a test generally screens for. It can screen for
knowledge, it can screen for ability of applying knowledge, it can screen for
understanding of the origins of knowledge (subjective questions, derivations),
it might also screen for nothing at all. A version of classroom smoke screen
that exists for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 days before that subject’s end term exam, I can safely say that more than 90%
of the class was completely unprepared. Those who had attended classes might
have some idea, those who hadn’t shouldn’t have had any idea except for what
they gained here and there in the few classes they attended. A teacher who has
been teaching for 6 years knows this and thus, the surprise quiz was not
screening for knowledge or it’s applicability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it screening for origins? Maybe. This is a tough one, because theoretically,
someone with a threshold amount of knowledge should be able to complete a
derivation. But if you have ever studied Real Analysis or Switching and Finite
Automata, you know that most derivations follow a very specific approach.
Approaching it from any other direction will lead you nowhere. (This is not true
for Graph Theory, where a lot of approaches seem to work. This course wasn’t
Graph Theory)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s about all the evidence I have. I don’t see the point of surprise quizzes
at all. But apart from being useless, I think they are &lt;em&gt;harmful&lt;/em&gt; because they
reward the wrong set of people: basically, a random set of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprise quizzes are often conducted by professors who don’t take daily
attendance in their classes. Instead, they keep saying “There could be a
surprise test on any day”, the implication being that students should be scared
enough to come to every class. Even if a student is scared, something might
happen that leads to the student missing a class. I have missed at least 5 8 am
classes where a surprise test was conducted in a course where I attended most of
the other classes; I am talking not attending 5-6 classes in the whole 4 month
semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, basically, surprise tests as a proxy for attendance reward the wrong set of
people. And they eliminate the reward for the people who should get it. I feel
bad about getting the answers right because if the teacher had taken attendance,
I wouldn’t have gotten those marks and that would have been fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, laziness leads to surprise tests, and surprise tests don’t reward the people
who are regular. &lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; Surprise tests reward a random subset of the students
in a class and should be done away with.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Cutouts 1.0 and the convenience of monolithic frameworks</title>
   <link href="/2018/03/20/cutouts-revamp"/>
   <updated>2018-03-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/03/20/cutouts-revamp</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/cutouts/graphs/commit-activity&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/cutouts-past-year.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph shows the commits made in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/cutouts&quot;&gt;cutouts&lt;/a&gt; repository over the past 1
year. I have been rather dormant the whole year on this project. In fact, the
last time this project saw some heavy development was back in October 2016 when
I was working on adding tags to the system and making it a better product that I
could use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surge in development during February was right before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/metakgp/lifehacking-add-ons-and-a-better-web-for-kgp-highlights-from-demo-day-3-ffc1fd6af7b&quot;&gt;Metakgp Demo
Day&lt;/a&gt; on February 15th. There were same gaping problems in Cutouts that I had
never considered. And the main reason behind this was that there were no users
except me. And I was using the application just as it was intended to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When others starting using it, they told me that the application was crashing
whenever they tried to add a Cutout. The logs showed me that I was doing
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;URI(link).host&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; variable and there were no validations setup
that would ensure that users could &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; add URLs in that field. This was
probably one of the glaring problems that I found and it acted as a trigger for
me to comb through the whole application and figure out what other assumptions I
had made which a non-me user would not instinctively abide by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding tags was one, where new users expected tags to work differently. Another
open feature request is that the link field shouldn’t be compulsory, instead the
user should be allowed to add text in that field. (Reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kshitij10496&quot;&gt;Kshitij&lt;/a&gt; who
uses Cutouts to store quotes from books!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After adding a title attribute to all cutouts, life on the application has
become far more convenient. Mentioning the charset in the downloaded HTML was
another minor goof that has lead to a prettier exported cutouts HTML page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another issue was with the ordering of cutouts. The default ordering
throughout the app seemed to be chronological, when the reverse chronological
order made a lot more sense as you would want to see the latest cutouts before
your older cutouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I was fairly happy with the quality of the application for new
users and the application had stopped crashing whenever people tried to do
things that weren’t standard, instead it would either give a decent error
message or fail gracefully without crashing. This was the v1.0 point for
Cutouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of other features that I wanted to implement mainly for my own benefit
but that I figured would bring more users in (because of the network effect)
were &lt;em&gt;sharing a cutout via email&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;creating a permalink for every cutout&lt;/em&gt;.
With the right meta tags, sharing them on Facebook and Twitter would cause more
people to visit cutouts and hopefully become members and use the app. Using
Rails &lt;a href=&quot;http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html&quot;&gt;Action mailers&lt;/a&gt;, this was far easier than implementing something
similar would have been on a Node framework like Express. Creating a permalink
was again simply creating a show method for the Cutout controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Demo Day, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nuwandavek&quot;&gt;Vivek Aithal&lt;/a&gt; gave me the suggestion of implementing a
feed of what everyone is cutting out. This was the ultimate way to use the
network effect to my advantage. Once again, Rails surprised me because
implementing it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/cutouts/commit/23c0b3b43ff62a4a1316b9c9f6eb44b6b85c345b&quot;&gt;incredibly easy!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The few things where Rails wasn’t pleasant to work with were the updation of
the Rails version itself (which I didn’t complete successfully, I am still on
Rails 4), the updation of Bootstrap to 5 (which I completed properly, although
it took an unreasonable amount of time to get there). The updation of the
versions of other Gems was much simpler. The bootstrap update gave me access to
the new color scheme that pops compared to the old, duller scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back at this revamp and relaunch, I realize that Rails has been very
very helpful whenever I have had to implement a new feature. Even if the feature
is involved and seems daunting at first, the pieces in Rails fail into place
very well and the implementation itself is tens of lines at most. Also, once
you make a commitment to using a monolithic framework like Rails for a big
project like this one, there is no going back. I don’t even want to imagine what
sort of effort it would take for me to transfer the application as is to another
language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Rails faces it’s most frustrating caveat is the management of the
development environment. The different gem versions, the ruby versions, the
rails asset pipeline: handling them is a huge pain, they don’t &lt;em&gt;just
work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;. If you want to update a Gem, that’s a completely different
battle and I wish you luck with fighting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node.js on the other hand would probably need a few 100 lines to build these
features, but the dependency management in Node.js is way simpler. In fact, when
I went through the same process on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/cli-cube-timer/commit/45885bc0853fb39660cb91f5b8979b0f00a8d8b1&quot;&gt;cli-cube-timer&lt;/a&gt;, the whole process was a
lot more pleasant and the main problem came up wherever the updated dependency
had changed an API. That seemed like a better use of time than struggling with
gem installations and those type of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will still say that Rails is a good framework, despite the frustration that
has often caused me to question my choice of framework back when I started this
project. Implementing new features takes very less time and once you get the
hang of it, it’s fun to write code in Ruby, although I have my own gripes with
the language. I will save them for another post. Another advantage of Rails is
the gem library and the community around it. There are gems to do almost
anything. But the same can be said about Node.js, so this isn’t an advantage as
much as it is a leveller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, there are some minor changes that are upcoming on Cutouts. The
long term goal is to have an application that has good test coverage. The
short-term goal is getting to v1.1. I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/cutouts/milestone/1&quot;&gt;already missed the due&lt;/a&gt; by 2
days and rescheduled further to the end of March. I will get there, soon. I
hugely underestimated how much I already had to accomplish in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S&lt;/strong&gt; Cutouts now has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CutoutsApp&quot;&gt;Twitter account: @CutoutsApp!&lt;/a&gt; If you use
Twitter, follow @CutoutsApp to remain posted!&lt;/p&gt;

studio&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;854&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vb60rrtTddQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has had the space for nearly 10 years now. And everything in it is outfitted
exactly as he likes it. He never searches for things in his studio, he just &lt;strong&gt;gets
them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hang on, this is not just a rave about Casey Neistat’s studio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about what the equivalent of a studio would be for a
programmer. The studio is the home for all the tools that you would use in your
work and life outside of work. That has got to start with a few staples: your OS,
your editor, your shell, your dotfiles. Actually, the complete &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/dotfiles&quot;&gt;dotfiles&lt;/a&gt;
repository. But is that all? &lt;strong&gt;Definitely not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scripts&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/search?l=Shell&amp;amp;o=asc&amp;amp;q=scripts&amp;amp;s=stars&amp;amp;type=Repositories&amp;amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&quot;&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/search?l=Shell&amp;amp;o=asc&amp;amp;q=oneliners&amp;amp;s=stars&amp;amp;type=Repositories&amp;amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&quot;&gt;repositories&lt;/a&gt; on Github with the name
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;oneliners&lt;/code&gt; which have a collection of a the user’s most commonly
used shell scripts. Great. So, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/oneliners&quot;&gt;oneliners&lt;/a&gt; is another part of the studio.
What next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dotfiles and oneliners have a very low time spent building them to time spent
using them ratio. So, they are a really good way to spend your time. Write more
and more oneliners. As many as you probably can churn out. The ideal case would
be one in which any task could be accomplished using just your brain or your
oneliners readme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about more involved contraptions? (eg: Neistat’s Overhead shooting rig)
These are not the typical build-once, use-forever shell scripts. They are more
involved. Sometimes, they are even complete web applications. Most of the time
though, they are single-file scripts or web applications that solve an extremely
personal problem. Eg: me with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cutouts.siddharthkannan.in&quot;&gt;cutouts&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;I really could not let that
opportunity to plug my thing go&lt;/em&gt;) or some other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~Cutouts is a way to save articles you read on the internet and want to store for
later.~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutouts is an application that I use to store the articles that I read on the
Internet alongwith the name of the author, a memorable quote from the article
and tags that let me arrange the articles. There are some more bells and
whistles which I added recently mainly to tell more people about it and help
fill a void for them, if they had one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share a cutout via email: The articles I cut-out, I always want to share them
  with &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;. Engaging with people and talking about all the perspectives on
  the issue at hand is a great way to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share the permalink to a cutout: In case I am not too crazy about email and I
  just want to send it over an IM app to someone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upgraded to Bootstrap 4: The new Bootstrap blue. &lt;strong&gt;double heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cutout visibility: &lt;em&gt;Give me six lines written by an honest man, and I will
  find something in it with which to hang him&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/ImDPr#selection-43.1-43.99&quot;&gt;Cardinal Richelieu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Cutouts &lt;a href=&quot;https://cutouts.siddharthkannan.in/feed&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt;: I want to see how many people are using it and what
  they are upto. (obviously, only public cutouts are shown here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutouts is a part of my digital studio. It’s a Rails applications that I have
spent quite a bit of time on. It solves a problem for me. I don’t know if many
other people have the same problem. I want to get this out there, so that if
they do have this problem, then Cutouts would make their life a little bit
easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crucial difference a physical studio and a digital one is that the
components of my digital studio need not be a part of just &lt;em&gt;my studio&lt;/em&gt;, they can
be a part of anyone’s studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;postscript&quot;&gt;Postscript&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is equivalent to a single shot showing all the things in a physical
studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There’s also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/metakgp-visualize-cli&quot;&gt;CLI Companion&lt;/a&gt; for this. (I wonder why I thought it necessary to build a web page &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a CLI)&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;In a particularly heavy repository creation period, I decided that I want to use the Github API to find out how often I create repositories. NBD.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/install-from-source-tmux-2-0&quot;&gt;Install tmux 2.0 from source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;There aren’t any official sources and I didn’t want to have to figure out the dependency tree again and again&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siddharthkannan.in/tls-handshake/&quot;&gt;Understanding the TLS Handshake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Probably one of the most useful repositories I have ever spent time on. I learnt an incredible amount reading the TLS 1.2 RFC and it actually came in handy this December! So, the time I spent on this repository was certainly the most productive 4 hours of my life!&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/youtube-chronological&quot;&gt;Youtube Chronological&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Youtube will let you show the uploads of a channel sorted by date but you can only play them sorted reverse chronologically. When you have just found a [new channel][22], almost always, you want to play the videos chronologically. I tried to look for services online that would take a playlist and reverse them, but I couldn’t find any. So, I delved into the YouTube API. This Node.js script makes raw calls to the YouTube API. No API helper or anything.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a long while since I have seen the repository pages of some of those
utilities. It feels great to list out all the things that I built. Terribly
great motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would love to see what constitutes your digital studio. So, if you
have written a post like this before, do drop a link to that in the comments
below. If you haven’t written anything like this yet, please, take an hour. Go
through the list of your Github repositories and find the things that you built
in the past and reminisce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S.&lt;/em&gt; I love writing blog posts. &lt;strong&gt;double heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Technological Unemployment - Summary of a summary</title>
   <link href="/2018/02/22/technological-unemployment-summary"/>
   <updated>2018-02-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/02/22/technological-unemployment-summary</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is this approach to consuming information online. I don’t know what it is
called or who came up with it. The approach is to look at a topic, write down
the solid questions you would like to answer about the topic, consume the
material about this topic that’s in front of you and after you are done, answer
the questions that you had started out with. With several blogs (esp Slate Star
Codex), this approach has helped me a lot. Especially because it gives me an
idea about what I would like to know, what my presumptions / beliefs about the
questions are &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; I read the article and am influenced by the author’s
presumptions and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/19/technological-unemployment-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/&quot;&gt;Technological
Unemployment&lt;/a&gt;
is a post on Slate Star Codex. I have been following this blog, albeit without
understanding much on several occasions, for the past month and I jumped right
out of my seat when I realized what this post was about. I had recently had a
discussion about this with my parents in the context of the (lately increasing)
AI paranoia articles in mainstream online and offline media and on sources like
LinkedIn where people seem to be posting stuff about this all the time. (Elon
Musk’s rather arbitrary position on this doesn’t help)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I read the post, I wrote down some questions and after reading the post
(and taking notes, &lt;em&gt;yeah.&lt;/em&gt;), I answered them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premise:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Age Male Labor Force Participation Rate went from 97% in 1950 to 88% in
\2014. Where did the ~10% of men go? Why aren’t they part of the workforce
anymore? Were advances in technology the cause for their exit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What sectors and income brackets were these 10% men a part of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is third-hand information. Scott Alexander (the blog post’s author) read
several papers and reports about the topic and composed his post. I have read
his post and skimmed through the text and analyzed the graphs in the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ccf_20170517_declining_labor_force_participation_sawhill1.pdf&quot;&gt;Brookings Institute Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My questions &lt;strong&gt;will not&lt;/strong&gt; be the same as the questions you would like to
answer depending on your age, field of employment, childhood etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The studies concentrate on the labor market in the US. So, it’s inherent in
the blog post that everything is in the context of the American labor market.
There will be wild differences between these numbers and the numbers for
India or China, but the comparisons between the US and countries like Japan,
Germany, Spain and other EU countries seems to indicate that the behaviour in
these countries is more or less similar and the US labor market &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be used
as a proxy for these countries’ labor market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The numbers in the tables have been taken from graphs that are mentioned
below the tables. The numbers are representative and as accurate as can
possibly be taken from a graph which doesn’t have labels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal:&lt;/strong&gt; Are people losing jobs because of advances in technology?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-age-group-level-of-education-and-gender-dominates-this-set&quot;&gt;What age-group, level of education and gender dominates this set?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the analysis, we concentrate on Prime Age Male Labor Force
Participation Rates. i.e Men between the ages of 25 and 55 who have a job.
Female LFPR are not considered here because the main jump for Female LFPR
came around 1990-2000 and it seems rather premature to make anything of
numbers that are &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; 20 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age Group&lt;/strong&gt; - All age groups; But mainly advanced ages; where disability can
be a major cause for retirement before the age of 55 or a change of role at
home (&lt;em&gt;stay-at-home dad&lt;/em&gt;); even apart from this, there seems to be some
indication that younger people have a degree of robustness in the selection
of their field of work and an option to go back to college and gain skills
as compared to older people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level of education&lt;/strong&gt; - People whose level of education is less than
high-school are the worst affected. Men with college degrees show a rate of
decline that has remained more-or-less unchanged since 1950. The following table
shows the Prime Age Male Labor Force Participation Rate distribution for three
years across level of education:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender:&lt;/strong&gt; Inconlusive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-kind-of-technology-lead-to-the-loss-of-jobs&quot;&gt;What kind of technology lead to the loss of jobs?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s better to rephrase this question as “Which sector lost the most amount of
jobs because of advances in technology?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing and middle-skill level, middle-wage jobs were the worst affected.
The conclusion on this is unanimous and there are no doubts about who was dealt
the worst hand here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing jobs as percent of total:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1948 - 30%
2010 - 10%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing jobs (absolute numbers):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the share of manufacturing the in the GDP has remained
fairly unchanged over this period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing has been losing jobs ever since World War 2. During the Industrial
Revolution, there was an exodus of people from agriculture to manufacturing.
Now, if there is to be an exodus, where would the people with the current
manufacturing jobs go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, it’s not the least-skilled jobs which lost out. In fact, they were
the ones that gained because it’s fairly hard to automate these jobs away. These
jobs are manually intensive or require some level of interpersonal communication
and robustness (say against vandals or robberies in the case of truck drivers)
which are not easy to solve in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quote from the article that sums it up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is potentially consistent with a story where the jobs that have been
easiest to automate are middle-class-ish. Some jobs require extremely basic
human talents that machines can’t yet match – like a delivery person’s ability
to climb stairs. Others require extremely arcane human talents likewise beyond
machine abilities – like a scientist discovering new theories of physics. The
stuff in between – proofreading, translating, records-keeping, metalworking,
truck driving, welding – is more in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one major caveat here though: As the number of jobs has always been
declining, it’s hard to say without a shred of doubt that the jobs that were
lost were indeed lost because of automation and not because people had a change
of mind and decided to pursue other jobs or manufacturing jobs became less
desired or some reason not related to automation at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jobs were lost mainly in the manufacturing sector and in sectors that require
medium skill level and are middle-wage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;was-this-technology-cheaper-over-a-period-of-time-compared-to-hiring-people&quot;&gt;Was this technology cheaper over a period of time, compared to hiring people?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t answer this question. Common sense seems to suggest that this should
be the case or else why would businesses do something that costs more and
employs fewer people? A quote from the blog post hints towards the same:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There may be some point at which we too stop being worth more than it costs to
replace us. And the decline of manufacturing, the increase in labor force
nonparticipation and despair in rural Rust Belt communities, etc, suggest that
point is fast arriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/19/technological-unemployment-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/#comment-603490&quot;&gt;This
comment&lt;/a&gt;
takes a stab at why even if one thing became cheaper, the inventors would be
&lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt; to move on to some other sector and if that continues, everything will
become really really cheap but everyone will also be out of a job. Where did I
end up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;strong&gt;Couldn’t answer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;did-the-jobs-which-were-lost-involve-a-hazardous-work-environment&quot;&gt;Did the jobs which were lost involve a hazardous work environment?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jobs like those on the 24 hour assembly line that cause a lot of employee
discomfort; toxic factories like the ones for fireworks, textile; works inside
coal mines. In general, these are environments that adversely affect the
employee just from working there. Dry cleaning is another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no particular indication here that jobs in hazardous environment were
more automated compared to non-hazardous environments. The Brookings Institute
report does provide a good out for us though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 reports the “Most Rapidly Declining Industries - by employment
projections” as Apparel, Leather and allied manufacturing; Tobacco
manufacturing; Postal service; Federal enterprises except Postal services;
Manufacturing and reproducing magnetic and optical media. The first two sectors
in this list are hazardous when the proper employee safety norms aren’t folloed,
but that probably won’t be the case in the developed economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;Not very conclusive; But &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the jobs which were lost did involve
hazardous environments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;were-the-jobs-that-were-lost-monotonous&quot;&gt;Were the jobs that were lost monotonous?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this is a resounding yes. Just from the definition of
middle-skill level, middle-wage jobs which have been the worst affected, this
should be apparent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Middle-paying occupations are &lt;strong&gt;stationary plant and related operators; metal,
machinery and related trade work; drivers and mobile plant operators; office
clerks;&lt;/strong&gt; precision, handicraft, craft printing, and related trade workers;
extraction and building trades workers; customer service clerks; &lt;strong&gt;machine
operators and assemblers;&lt;/strong&gt; and other craft and related trade workers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The occupations in bold are monotonous, in my opinion. I am probably wrong, so
please make your own judgement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;A resounding yes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;did-the-people-who-lost-their-job-find-another-job&quot;&gt;Did the people who lost their job find another job?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If yes, was the new job higher or lower paying than the old one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, we are stuck without any data. But we have some strong indications
about the trend here. The consensus seems to be that most of the workers who
were in middle-skill, middle-income jobs who lost their jobs, slid into
low-skill, low-wage jobs, because they couldn’t complete the requirements and
acquire the skills to move to the high-skill, higher paying jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This being the norm, there are certainly some people who do gain these skills
and move into higher paying jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong indications that most people who lost middle-income jobs, slipped into
low-wage jobs. While the others either exit the workforce or gained the skills
required to move to a high-skill, high-wage job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I conclude exactly as Scott Alexander does at the end of his post. I don’t think
the people who aren’t part of the workforce anymore are not here because of the
advancements in technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology has always been progressing forward and there doesn’t seem to be
anything historical happening right now (and there aren’t any indications that
something of the sort will happen in the next few decades)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the rosy picture painted by more people leaving the workforce early
to retire, take care of family at home, or because of disability is one worth
considering; even if it seems too good to be true and can’t be accepted whole
heartedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the end of my third hand information dissemination effort. As mentioned
earlier, definitely read the SlateStarCodex post. If you have the time, then
read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ccf_20170517_declining_labor_force_participation_sawhill1.pdf&quot;&gt;Brookings Insitute report&lt;/a&gt;. It presents the data they have very well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>2 weeks of Monochromacy</title>
   <link href="/2018/01/28/2-weeks-monochromacy"/>
   <updated>2018-01-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/01/28/2-weeks-monochromacy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It all started with a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/952969906315698177&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2018-01-28-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My phone is now two years old and I was looking for the next thing out there
because I am bored with my phone and I &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; don’t want to buy a new phone.
I am pretty sure this is the first time in my life I have actually not wanted to
buy new hardware, even if I have the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like my Nexus 5X, but I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to do something to keep it interesting.  Enter,
Monochromacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I have had ~150 tabs open on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://brave.com&quot;&gt;phone
browser&lt;/a&gt; for as long as I can remember. I never found the time
to either read everything or send them to Pocket and forget about it for a year.
I was reading a little bit too much news lately. My goal with this change was
two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do something with my phone that would keep it interesting to me&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend less time reading news articles and keeping up with “current affairs”.
  Spend more time reading books, instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 weeks on, I think I have achieved both these aims and I am ready to continue
with this experiment for a little bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main question that comes to your mind if you haven’t done this before is
probably “How drastic of a change is Monochromacy really?” Not a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost nothing in today’s vanilla Android feature set depends on color. You can
still send messages, read emails, visit web pages, scroll through the infinite
time sink that calls itself Instagram, play a game like &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.mmmfingers2&quot;&gt;MMM
Fingers&lt;/a&gt;.
You can still take color pictures (they will appear black and white on your
phone, but they are actually color. this is &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; not a doubt I had when
I took my first picture after turning on monochromacy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two things that became unusable were (a) Read receipts on apps like Whatsapp
and Signal and (b) several of Instagram’s features. Read receipts are
self-explanatory, the double tick simply changes color and this is something
that won’t be detectable at a glance, you can still go into message details or
something and check this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram has several features which become unusable without color. It has a
too-good-to-be-true editing screen in the Story section. The annotation
capabilities; drawing, adding text, backgrounds etc. All the features are very
powerful, but can only be used in Black and White (you can’t use any
other color as these might have low contrast and not be visible on color
screens. You must stick to Black and White). Filters also become pretty
cumbersome to use because it’s not easy to predict how exactly the photo is
going to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, &lt;strong&gt;it has been a productive change&lt;/strong&gt;. I have been reading more books
(maybe because they are more interesting?) and I have been scrolling less
through time sink applications (because I have grown out of it? Stop kidding
yourself, human) I intend to stick with this.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pragmatic GoLang Workshop - Follow-up</title>
   <link href="/2018/01/22/pragmatic-go-follow-up"/>
   <updated>2018-01-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/01/22/pragmatic-go-follow-up</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kwoc.kossiitkgp.in/summit&quot;&gt;Kharagpur Open Source Summit
2018&lt;/a&gt;, there was a Pragmatic GoLang workshop
on 20th January, for 3 hours.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kshitij10496&quot;&gt;Kshitij&lt;/a&gt;
organized and ran it. By all accounts, it was a great success! He did a really
good job with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://slides.com/kshitij10496/pragmatic-go&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; and with
delivering the workshop! The workshop was originally scheduled for 3 hours but
it ran for nearly 4 hours, and people sat patiently and programmed alongwith
him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was part of the team who was there helping him out with the doubts that
everyone who came to the session had. These are some of the things I learnt in
the workshop and some notes about GoLang for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GoLang requires the opening brace of a function to be on the same line as the
  closing parentheses of the function definition:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// allowed&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// not allowed&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I remember reading about this in the Go “How to Format your Code” section
  and thinking to myself that this is perfect because this is the style I
  swear by whenever I write JavaScript!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go doesn’t have a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; type. It’s mentioned pretty clearly in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/ref/spec#Numeric_types&quot;&gt;Types
  RefSpec&lt;/a&gt; but I ended up expecting
  a similar construct to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. I should start using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;int64&lt;/code&gt; instead of just
  &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; so that the code works on all architectures!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t suffer from fall-through, the thing that forms the
  material for several of the trickiest questions about C++. This is GOOD!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arrays can’t be resized. Slices are references to arrays. Slices work a lot of
  like Vectors in C++, I now realize. Slices are a very convenient data
  structure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Functions are first-class objects in Go. With lambdas, functions being
  first class objects, and closures being treated without a frown, Go achieves
  several of the things that I love about JavaScript! (Go is such a mixture of
  features from every paradigm of programming)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Channels can be closed. This enables iteration over the channel using the
  &lt;em&gt;for-range&lt;/em&gt; structure!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this stuff that I have learned about writing “Idiomatic Go” enables me to
go back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/year-in-twitter&quot;&gt;year-in-twitter&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/leprechaun&quot;&gt;leprechaun&lt;/a&gt; and do things &lt;em&gt;the Go way&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidebar:&lt;/strong&gt; I gave a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/2018.01.16-063824/http://kwoc.kossiitkgp.in/summit/106&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;
titled &lt;strong&gt;Node.js, GoLang and Concurrency&lt;/strong&gt; on 21st January! It went well (I
think). The video should be up soon. I am working on an appropriate HTML page
with the resources I would like to distribute with the talk. (slides, code,
further reading)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>2017 Review of Podcasts</title>
   <link href="/2018/01/13/2017-podcasts-review"/>
   <updated>2018-01-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/01/13/2017-podcasts-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2017 was the year that I started listening to podcasts. It’s a new form of media
and I am psyched to have taken to it. Podcasts seem to be getting more and more
popular by the day, and I am really excited to see what happens to this format!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amrav.net&quot;&gt;Vikrant Varma&lt;/a&gt; recently published his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amrav.net/books-2017&quot;&gt;2017 Review Of
Books&lt;/a&gt; and this post is inspired by his post.
I have been reading books and I started cataloguing what I read on Goodreads
only a couple years ago. On the other hand, this is my first year of listening
to podcasts, so I am aiming to build a much bigger collection of what I listen
to as the years go by! (This list is pretty small!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything in this list is great (podcasts are easy to drop if you aren’t quite
interested in how the story goes!) Everything in bold is INCREDIBLE! Aaron
Swartz &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2011&quot;&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt; rather eloquently:
(quote changed for podcasts)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Podcasts in bold are those that were so great my heart leaps at the chance to
tell you about them even now. If you only have time to listen to some of this,
listen to them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;podcasts&quot;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisiscriminal.com/&quot;&gt;Criminal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is one podcast that I absolutely LOVE. It’s not a crime podcast. It’s a
 podcast about the people who get caught up in the world of crime. Many of
 the episodes are still lodged in my memory because of how unique the story
 was. These stories are not the ones that will come up in movies like Taken.
 These are the stories that are too insignificant for movies.
 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PhoebeVJudge/&quot;&gt;Phoebe Judge’s&lt;/a&gt; narration is totally on
 point. It’s hard not to love her voice!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://serialpodcast.org/season-one&quot;&gt;Serial Season 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Thousands of words have been written about why Serial is the best podcast
 from last year. In 12 episodes, Sarah Koenig went through the whole story of
 a 1999 murder and tried to “play detective”. She explains everything and has
 put up everything she has on the website. We get an intimate look at the
 whole crime, the people around it, why did he lie, why did she change her
 story, and so on. I have spent hours obsessing over this podcast, until I
 realised that &lt;em&gt;the answer is unknowable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/whyd-you-push-that-button&quot;&gt;Why’d you Push That Button?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A light hearted podcast about why we use technology the way we do. The
 narration and topics are all upbeat. The experts that they bring in in the
 second half of each episode are worth listening to because they give a
 window into the thought processes that go behind the design of the most
 popular products we use today!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.martyrmade.com/fear-loathing-in-the-new-jerusalem/&quot;&gt;Fear and Loathing in the New Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.martyrmade.com/&quot;&gt;MartyrMade&lt;/a&gt; podcasts series&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Over 22 hours, Darryl Cooper goes deep into the Israel-Palestine conflict.
 The story doesn’t start at 1967, or at 1948, or in 1929, or before WW1. The
 story starts in the 1880s. I still have 10 hours (2 episodes) to go, but
 till now, I have already learnt so much about the conflict. It’s not a
 biased version of events. Cooper works overtime to ensure that the
 statements he makes don’t appear biased even under the strictes scrutiny. He
 spends an hour on a single riot, to ensure that he paints the complete
 picture, to ensure that he doesn’t miss a crucial detail which ends up as
 the reason for our bias towards one side or the other.  Who’s wrong? Who’s
 right? These decisions are complicated and Cooper lets you make them. He
 simply delivers the story.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is certainly not for the hobbyist interested in learning about the
 conflict. This is for anyone who finds the conflict fascinating. To go from
 a persecuted community in the early 1900s, to asking for a state from the
 Arabs during WW1, Israel is now in a position to &lt;em&gt;give&lt;/em&gt; a state to the
 Arabs. I couldn’t quite comprehend how exactly something so spectacular can
 even happen, &lt;strong&gt;that’s&lt;/strong&gt; the reason I started listening to this podcast.
 This paragraph sums it up:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is so like a Hollywood movie. There’s the peasants. There’s the Jews
who come to displace them. The Jews are successful in displacing them. But then,
it’s time for the peasant hero to come in and either reclaim the land or
come to a settlement with the Jews, depending on what sort of a movie you
are watching. In real life though, there are no heroes. How far is this
conflict going to go? Is there some solution to it? Who will find that
solution? This is not a case of good vs. evil. Things are not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(Not an exact quote. This is the gist of what he said.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;episodes&quot;&gt;Episodes&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Absolutely mind-boggling. What if you walk up to a teller and hand them a
 note saying “Hand over all the money in the register right now, or I will
 shoot up this place”? I had to read several news articles to make sure that
 this mode of theft wasn’t just fictional!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;How hard is it to change the way people think about you? Turning a new leaf
 is never as easy as it is portrayed to be. This is the story of living with
 expectations you don’t want to meet anymore, because you are a different
 person.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Cyber stalking isn’t just a joke. It’s a traumatic part of life for some
 people. It’s shocking that there aren’t laws around this. It isn’t even
 treated like real-life stalking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Our instincts tell us to be polite as much as we can: Don’t ruffle feathers,
 don’t raise your voice, don’t get into a fight. If you are mild mannered and
 someone starts exploiting you, what do you do? This is the story of a
 mild-mannered engineer in the 70s who went through it all and did so rather
 nonchalantly. I was restless as I heard more and more of this episode, I
 wanted something to happen, I wanted it to be a movie basically. I wanted
 someone to come along and help him and punch the bad guy in the face. That
 doesn’t happen. A rude reminder of our docileness, even in the face of evil.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The hilarious story of a statue of Buddha put up to stop garbage dumping
 becoming a landmark in Oakland. Lesson: Don’t look for help with your
 problems. Just go out there and solve them!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Why do we all sound like idiots when we talk to babies? Don’t be
embarrassed, we’re helping them acquire language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Also, pronouns are a messy part of language and it’s better to save babies
from that atleast when they are really young!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The metric system vs. US Customary units. Satellites have been lost because
of the unit systems; millions of dollars worth of problems; and still the US
hangs on. It’s not like the US ain’t trying:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ryan Dahl: “I think Node is not the best system to build a massive web
server. I would use Go for that. And honestly, that’s the reason why I left

   <title>Year in Review - 2017</title>
   <link href="/2018/01/01/2017-review"/>
   <updated>2018-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2018/01/01/2017-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This has been a pretty good year for my blog, I think(??). Of course, the
metrics that I use are rather subjective and might not bear even a semblance to
the truth. In my head, 2017’s quick recap would definitely feature these things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I started
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/tag/#100daysofwriting&quot;&gt;100DaysOfWriting&lt;/a&gt; on
  the 18th of February. That was also my first post on the blog in 2017, and
  in almost a year!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html&quot;&gt;SHA-1 was broken&lt;/a&gt;
  for the first time with some binary padding data, two PDFs had the same
  SHA-1 even though they were different!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I watched a little bit of Veep, but then gave up after the 4th season! Selena
  was just about to become president. I wish I could continue where I left
  off, unfortunately, it’s too late for that now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://public-inbox.org/git/xmqqinjnhcr8.fsf@gitster.mtv.corp.google.com/&quot;&gt;git patch was ejected&lt;/a&gt;
 (not merged into master), but the patch made it as far as pu.
  I had a really good time reading the code that powers so much
  of software today. It was fun, I will pick it up again
  sometime in the next year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I updated from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/writing/ubuntu/installation/2017/03/04/day-15/&quot;&gt;16.04 LTS&lt;/a&gt;
After a nerve wracking few hours of guess work, I was able to get encrypted
ext4 partitions to work! (+ &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/programming/ubuntu/installation/setup/2017/03/05/day-16/&quot;&gt;auto-mounting on start-up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I watched and absolutely loved Big Little Lies S1. Season 2 is going to be
  absolutely epic!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Homeland’s 6th Season lived upto the mark and then some. Quinn’s resurrection
  is on the cards, I hope&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cloudfare faced Cloudbleed and the buffer overflow error reared it’s head once
  more! Thankfully, GoLang is here to solve all the problems. (Right?!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I struggled with a weird bug on Ubuntu where my mouse would simply stop
  working now and again. I am still facing this bug, but it has reduced to
  a much more acceptable number of occurences. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/writing/technology/problems/problem-solving/2017/03/25/day-36/&quot;&gt;modprobe fix&lt;/a&gt;
  works for now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I started reading Austen! I read Emma, Sense and Sensibility and
  Persuasion. Her other three novels are on deck for next year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Handmaid’s Tale (Atwood) took the spot of “The Dystopia I fear most”,
  displacing 1984.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Demonetisation was an eerie reminder of the power that the
  state wields in this country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The internet came together on r/place and did something to a canvas that
  boggled everyone’s mind and captured my imagination. Oh, I LOVE the
  Internet!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I re-watched about 10 seasons worth of Seinfeld. I am not exagerrating.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;United Airlines dragged a passenger through the cabin and everyone was
  hysteric about it. Ended up reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/airplanes/books/2017/05/14/day-86/&quot;&gt;a book written by a flight attendant&lt;/a&gt;
  and developing a lot of empathy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I taped my webcam, updated my RSA keys to 4096 bits and enabled ufw to close
  all ports, all the time. Go Privacy!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/nautilus/missed/rant/ubuntu/update/open-mic/comedy/2017/04/14/day-56/&quot;&gt;Nautilus update irritating&lt;/a&gt;
  but didn’t switch and am now quite happy about it!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I watched Masaan, Lunchbox, Contagion, and Another Earth for the umpteenth
  time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I interned at &lt;a href=&quot;http://elanic.in/&quot;&gt;Elanic&lt;/a&gt; for 2 months! I learned a lot and
  it helped me &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; Node.js!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WannaCry happened, MalwareTechBlog stopped it, then MalwareTechBlog got stuck
  in the US (and is still there!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/chrome/browsers/twitter/2017/05/11/day-83/&quot;&gt;stayed with Chrome&lt;/a&gt;
and then, switched to Quantum two days after it released. Quantum is the best
browser I have ever used in my life till now!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I had a tweet blow up (to some extent).
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/862524711980285953/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2017-05-11-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was stranded in
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/nature/floods/bangalore/2017/05/26/day-98/&quot;&gt;Koramangala&lt;/a&gt;
  for a couple hours and then we waded through a feet of water at around 1 am to get home!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I started listening to
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/writing/books/2017/06/01/an-update/&quot;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;
  and I haven’t been able to go back to my way of life before. They are only
  getting better and more popular, so that’s one of the good things that
  happened this year!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I watched the 19 episodes of My So Called Life! That show &lt;strong&gt;did not&lt;/strong&gt; deserve
  to be cancelled right in the middle of a season&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I watched 2 seasons of Downton Abbey and I am absolutely in love with Sybil’s
  character&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I read parts the TLS 1.2 RFC and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siddharthkannan.in/tls-handshake/&quot;&gt;wrote an overview&lt;/a&gt;.
Considering that this came in handy in an interview I had later this year,
this has been a very worthwhile use of time. Much more so than I had
anticipated it at the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/internet/tls/security/https/2017/06/13/understanding-tls/&quot;&gt;beginning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I spent &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_Puja&quot;&gt;Durga Pujo&lt;/a&gt; in Kolkata and
  saw first-hand how chaotic a city can be!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I raved about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/npm/api/goofs/software/2017/10/08/npm-downloads-api-change/&quot;&gt;NPM’s abrupt change to their download-stats API&lt;/a&gt;
  which got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/750887/npm_changes_downloads_api_and_informs_the_world/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link&quot;&gt;some attention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I obsessed over &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/tag/#primer&quot;&gt;Primer (2004)&lt;/a&gt;
  and managed to untangle most of the mysteries. This is going right up there
  on the shelf of my favourite movies of all time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I watched Arrival and fell in love with time travel, aliens, Amy Adams,
  science and language. All over again!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here we are. 1st January, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S&lt;/strong&gt; This post ended up using the pronoun “I” a lot more than I expected it
to. I didn’t know how to phrase what I wanted to say appropriately without doing
that. The excessive usage does make me uncomfortable, but I guess it can’t be
avoided. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=633rwYgYJDs&quot;&gt;Casey Neistat&lt;/a&gt; did the
same thing when he made a review video. His videos are SO GOOD.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What does "wrapping text to 80 columns" mean?</title>
   <link href="/2017/12/07/wrapping-text"/>
   <updated>2017-12-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/12/07/wrapping-text</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you write a line of text that is really long, you can do two things. You
can enter a “linebreak” or a “newline” after every few characters. Or you can
not do that and let the line be as long as it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wrapping text at 80 columns” implies that you have configured your editor to
insert a “newline” after you have typed 80 characters on a particular line. The
cursor moves to the next line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sample unwrapped text: &lt;a href=&quot;http://ix.io/CRZ&quot;&gt;Unwrapped text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sample wrapped text: &lt;a href=&quot;http://ix.io/CS0&quot;&gt;Wrapped text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between these two formats might not be obvious to some at first
glance. The unwrapped sample will look different on different screens. If your
screen is really wide, you will be stuck with each line having about 20 words.
If your screen is really small (like a phone screen) then you will have a
flowing passage of text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/unwrapped-pc.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Unwrapped text on a 16 inch PC Screen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/unwrapped-phone-portrait.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Unwrapped text on a 16:9 phone in portrait mode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/unwrapped-phone-landscape.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Unwrapped text on a 16:9 phone in landscape mode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wrapped sample will look good on all computer screens because 80 characters
is some sort of a lower threshold (Yes, there’s a reason that 70-80 is the
preferred line length). I am not sure where this threshold comes from, but I
don’t think the reason matters. Although, you should be aware that wrapped text
doesn’t look like a flowing paragraph on phone screens. The newlines in between
will cause some quirks. But these don’t matter because no one is reviewing C
Code on Phone screens (except some Git maintainers on a holiday)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/wrapped-pc.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Wrapped text on a 16 inch PC Screen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/wrapped-phone-portrait.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Wrapped text on a 16:9 phone in Portrait mode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/wrapped-phone-landscape.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Wrapped text on a 16:9 phone in Landcape mode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that in the wrapped text, no matter what screen size you see this on, the
newlines occur exactly at the same place. Larger the screen, the more whitespace
you see on the right of the text and below the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas on the unwrapped text, the newline could be anywhere depending on your
screen size (it’s not technically a newline as the text doesnt have any
newlines, it’s just a linebreak that’s inserted by the software rendering the
text). Also, the larger the screen, the more whitespace below the text. There
will be no whitespace on the left or right of the text because the text will
expand to accomodate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other weird stuff: Vim has a mode which can wrap text for you while
writing but still not enter a newline to actually make it wrapped text. I don’t
know about this mode and don’t use it. You shouldn’t use it either unless your
use-case calls for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I had to explain what wrapping text meant to people on GitHub, and I
couldn’t find anything on the internet for it. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/2017.12.07-071849/http://kwoc.kossiitkgp.in/&quot;&gt;Kharagpur Winter of Code
2017&lt;/a&gt; started on
1st December. Since then, I have been getting patches from people who are
&lt;em&gt;extremely new&lt;/em&gt; to GitHub, Open Source, Programming, Computers etc. Often, while
explaining concepts to them in GitHub review comments, I realised that many of
the terms that I take for granted are murkily defined. It’s also hard to find
“what” they are online, which increases the information assymetry and ends up
wasting the time of everyone involved. That’s the reason, I wrote this post.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NPM changes downloads-stats API and informs the world 38 hours later</title>
   <link href="/2017/10/08/npm-downloads-api-change"/>
   <updated>2017-10-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/10/08/npm-downloads-api-change</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to this post. The first is about what happened,
chronologically and the second part is about why I was so disappointed with
this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; All the times in this post which are not annotated are India Standard
Time = GMT + 5.5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happened&quot;&gt;What happened?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around 10 AM on 29th August, 2017, I was proof reading my resume and clicked
  on one of the npm-stat.com links that I have there. I reached that page and
  realised that the number shown there was drastically low compared to the
  number that I already knew was the real one.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I was surprised. The first thing that came to mind was that NPM had deleted
  the old data leading to the downloads in 2015 being shown as 0. I
  immediately checked other packages. I checked some really famous packages
  like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;express&lt;/code&gt; and users like @sindresorhus. All of their downloads were
  being shown as 0 in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I dug a bit more and reached the code-base for
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pvorb/npm-stat.com&quot;&gt;npm-stat.com&lt;/a&gt; and from the line on
  the website “All data comes directly from NPM”, I realised that the website
  probably worked using an API from NPM itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;npm-stat.com is a webpack based frontend JS app. I have some experience with
  them and thus, I was quickly able to figure out where the API call was
  happening.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pvorb/npm-stat.com/blob/b79fb8abc7a200c687c9f6985c86a46402a53792/src/charts.js#L266-L268&quot;&gt;these 3
  lines&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getDownloadsUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pkg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fromDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;/downloads/range/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;dateToDayKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fromDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;dateToDayKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;encodeURIComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pkg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The request is of the form: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/downloads/range/2015-05-01:2016-11-01/terminal-wallet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that I had found out the downloads API itself, I immediately checked if
  the data for 2015 was there or not. I found that it was. This was a relief.
  I immediately downloaded JSONs of everything from 2015 to that day, but this
  was where I noticed the rate-limiting!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I requested data from 2015-05-01 to 2017-08-29 but it only returned data
  starting from 2016-02-29, that’s exactly 18 months before the end date. I
  had found the issue!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the first real milestone. Once I realised what was going on, I
  immediately reached out to people:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(a) Open a ticket with NPM support&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/npm-blog-support.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(b) Tweet to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/izs&quot;&gt;@izs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/902407527702315008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2017-08-29-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(c) Open an issue on
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/npm/registry/issues/206&quot;&gt;npm/registry&lt;/a&gt;. Here again, the
  complete issue was explained.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(d) Send an email to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pvorb&quot;&gt;Paul Vorbach&lt;/a&gt; who’s the
  maintainer of npm-stat.com.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this was going down at 11 am IST on Tuesday 29th August 2017. That’s 10:30
  PM PDT which is the timezone NPM support seems to be operating in. So, I
  wasn’t expecting a response from them until the next day at the least. I got
  an official reply on the support ticket 17 hours after at 4:44 am on 30th
  August 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/npm-blog-ticket-response.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all this reaching out, (it was around noon already), I sat down to
  work a patch for npm-stat.com. It took me about a day. Around 4 pm the next
  day, on August 30, I opened &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pvorb/npm-stat.com/pull/47&quot;&gt;npm-stat.com #47&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There was one round of back-and-forth with @pvorb before the PR was merged
  on September 7th, a week later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On August 31st 1 AM IST, 38 hours after I first noticed the problem,
(I have no way to know exactly when the API was changed), they
announced the rate-limiting on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.npmjs.org/post/164799520460/api-rate-limiting-rolling-out&quot;&gt;their
blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/npm-blog-post.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The documentation on npm/registry that they are talking about was added in
  two commits:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/npm/registry/commit/b0adb965c15936114751377401b7f35b1f51d425&quot;&gt;chore: document downloads api
  limits&lt;/a&gt;
  at 2:08 AM IST on August 31st&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/npm/registry/commit/73f3ac456e1d80ffe0d49d19a74bfccdb58b4aaf&quot;&gt;fix: jan 10 not jan
  01&lt;/a&gt;
  at 2:24 AM IST on August 31st.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I found this from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/npm/registry/blame/73f3ac456e1d80ffe0d49d19a74bfccdb58b4aaf/docs/download-counts.md&quot;&gt;git’s blame
  view&lt;/a&gt;.
  Clearly, their plan was all along to make the change and inform later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-i-even-care&quot;&gt;Why do I even care?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s just a downloads API, CHILL MAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one actually said that to me, but you might be wondering why this was such a
big deal for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly because I have download numbers on my CV and when someone clicks on the
link and sees a number less than the number they just saw and no apparent
explanation, it’s a bad look. There’s almost no explanation that can be given in
less than a few minutes time. (Hence, the request to Paul Vorbach to put a note
on his website)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also because this was unprecedented! This sort of an API change (i.e. a change
without any prior warning) leads to every tool that depends on the API
malfunctioning! Their official stand is that they will keep doing it in the
future as well, and they will only &lt;em&gt;follow-up&lt;/em&gt; with documentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We reserve the right to further limit API usage without warning when we see a
pattern of requests causing the API to be unusable for most callers. We’ll
follow up with documentation in these cases. Our primary goal is to prevent
API use from either deliberately or accidentally making the service
unresponsive for other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like NPM. Irrespective of that, if you want to work with Node.js then you are
absolutely going to HAVE to use it. There are many things that could have been
done better here: more warning before such API changes, a tweet an hour before
the API change was deployed would have been notice enough. Or how about adding a
field to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/downloads&lt;/code&gt; api response that informed the user that the data is
not for the complete range that they requested because of a new API change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a monthly newsletter, a Twitter account, a blog and they chose not to
post about this anywhere. I can only guess that they were undergoing an attack
and they had to limit the API to fight that. I can’t believe anyone would have a
planned move to limit data and not inform their users about it prior to the
change itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explaining a change 38 hours after deploying the change is just not acceptable
for an API that’s so prevalent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tl-dr&quot;&gt;TL; DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NPM limited their &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/downloads&lt;/code&gt; API to return data only for the last
18 months if you request for a range more than 18 months. They informed the
world about it 38 hours after I first noticed the change. This lead to
npm-stat.com malfunctioning and showing drastically low numbers because of years
of data was simply not there.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Music Update - August 2017</title>
   <link href="/2017/10/07/music-update-august-2017"/>
   <updated>2017-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/10/07/music-update-august-2017</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ah, so now, I can finally get to it! (I have been wanting to write this article
since August 31, but something kept getting in the way. Also, writing it is sort
of a hassle because I have to get the screenshots etc. So, maybe I was putting
it away.) On with it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quickly:&lt;/em&gt; There’s a recommendations section at the end. It has 3 songs I think
you should listen to. If you are not interested in my droning on and on about
lyrics and throwbacks and percieved similarities, press &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;END&lt;/code&gt; on your keyboard
and check those three songs out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month was about two TV shows: the Atypical Season 1 soundtrack and a couple
of songs that come up in Modern Family!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/user/siddharth_kannan_12/playlist/7z1vVXPfCITL6vzK49VOLu&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/music-aug-2017-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two tracks are from Modern Family. The first one’s really old and I
hadn’t ever heard of it. It’s a beautiful story to listen to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paint It Black from the Westworld sound track made a comeback. It has a great
  piano beginning. But the bass drum + violin accompaniment captured my
  imagination a lot more! I have no clue what Ramin Djawadi does, but whatever he
  does, I wish he keeps doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I rememeber he also did the one good thing about the Game of Thrones season
  finale: the soundtrack to that long scene in which Cersei burns buildings up,
  the king commits suicide etc. Come to think of it, that track also reminds me
  of this with the deep bass and the sustained note. There were vocals in that
  track (it’s called Finale). But the organ is still predominant. His style is
  unique!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/user/siddharth_kannan_12/playlist/3sZEhd23RcB2CatiI9AfJJ&quot;&gt;Atypical Season 1
  Soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;.
  I have linked a Spotify playlist of the songs that stood out the most to me.
  Heads will Roll and Love Struck were stuck in my head for days (still are!).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;White Lies was the one song I had already heard in this bunch! When it came
  on in the series, I remember the scene also. She’s walking down the steps
  and going to Nick’s bar, and then the song fades out as she says something.
  I was so excited to recognize a song from a TV show. It was like recognising
  Paint It, Black when it came on in Westworld.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I go to the albums I heard this month, a couple of the outliers here.
  Trains by Porcupine Tree and Pokerface by Lady Gaga (the latter is not in
  the screenshot). Trains just came back as a whim, I sort of wanted to listen
  to the prelude to that song.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Pokerface came to my mind because of &lt;em&gt;HOW SIMILAR&lt;/em&gt; it sounds to Heads will
  Roll! The same aggresive female vocals, the similar drop. The resemblance
  was pleasant!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Album 1: &lt;strong&gt;Bookends by Simon and Garfunkel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/music-aug-2017-bookends.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I had a particularly good month in terms of the number of new albums I heard
this month! Three in total, 1 I started last month but the remaining two were
wildcards!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Bookends is a really old album and I am certain that I am the last to get on
the Simon and Garfunkel bandwagon. They are SO GOOD! I watched some of their
live performances as well, nothing stood out.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My favourites are quite obviously Track 10: Mrs. Robinson and Track 11: Hazy
Shade of Winter! I am obsessed with Hazy Shade of Winter. It’s only 2:17,
which sucks. There’s literally nothing else I can even think about. It’s a
CLASSIC!  The way I found it was also a really surprising and funny event. I
heard the whole album mainly because I had played Mrs. Robinson from the album
on Spotify and Spotify played the whole album.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, apart from 6, 10, 11 and 12, nothing else really stuck. I am not sure
why, probably just because it’s just so old and it’s from another era.
Something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Album 2: &lt;strong&gt;Broken Machine by Nothing but Thieves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/music-aug-2017-broken-machine.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I started with their debut album last month. And THIS MONTH! I started
  listening to it with Sorry and Amsterdam. But as I heard all of it, and
  repeatedly heard it all, I realised that I couldn’t find one track that I
  wanted to skip when I was listening to this album! It’s insanely
  time-consuming, but also so satisfying!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This album is sort-of the reason that I have such disbelief at how good this
  month has been in terms of new music and the amount of GREAT tracks I found.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;From this one, I have to choose Tracks 1-7, 9, 11-13. There’s no going
  around the fact that I have left out Particles and two acoustic renditions.
  I really don’t want to leave anything out. Particles is like If I Get High
  and different from the other songs in the album and that’s why it sounded
  out of place to me. That is the only reason that I have left it out.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;4, 5, 6, 7 have such good lyrics. Especially, this particular passage from
  Soda:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’m an exception, it’s hard to accept
  because I try to be happy, but then I forget.
  They tell me I need to chill man, it’s all in your head
  Maybe I am paranoid&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I once had a thought, but don’t know where it went
  coz I have been living on Soda and cheap cigarettes
  &lt;strong&gt;Maybe when I was a kid, I was dropped on my head,
  yeah, that would make some sense!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I was on a 3-hour journey from Kharagpur to Calcutta when these lines first
  registered in my brain. I then selected “Repeat 1” in Play Music and heard
  the lyrics again and again and then the song clicked for me!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This was a great throwback to the Petrol Bunk conversation that Aaron and
  Abe have in Primer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Aaron: Maybe your life is in disarray and you start to wonder, what caused
  this? How did things get like this? … As if, if their mother had breastfed
  them, their lives would have been different.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Abe: &lt;strong&gt;Bunch of whiners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Aaron: Yeah, they’re a bunch of whiners. … What’s worse? &lt;strong&gt;Thinking you are
  being paranoid or knowing you should be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;P.S.&lt;/em&gt; If you thought my Primer obsession had run it’s course, you’ve got
  another thing coming)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Album 3: &lt;strong&gt;Modern Vampires of the City by Vampire Weekend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/music-aug-2017-modern-vampires.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I already said, this was one hell of a good month of music! Almost no
  repetition except for music I found this month and I liked most of what I
  heard.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I have already talked about this a bit in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/music/monthly/update/arcade-fire/nothing-but-thieves/2017/08/12/july-music-update/&quot;&gt;last music
  update&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I found this album on Spotify Discover, which is KA-RAZY! My favourites are
  still tracks 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10! This album is the one I am going to go back
  to when I need something to brighten my day. The happiness in this album is
  contagious. A sample passage from Hannah Hunt, if you tend to not beleive
  me:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A man of faith said, “Hidden eyes could see what I was thinking”,
I just smiled and told him, that was only true of Hannah,
and we glided on through Waverley and Lincoln&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Days were long and nights no longer, count the seconds, watching hours,
though we live on the US Dollar, you and me, got our sense of time!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Common! What did I say?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Song&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/thead&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Finger Back&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Modern Vampires of the City&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Vampire Weekend&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Reset Me&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Broken Machine&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Nothing but Thieves&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Hazy Shade of Winter&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Bookends&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Simon and Garfunkel&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About this section:&lt;/em&gt; I know everyone has songs that they want you to hear.
  I also know how hard it is to listen to something and be present and not
  just glide through it.  So, I am starting this section on music updates
  where I get to pick 3 songs from that month which I absolutely want you to
  hear. (I figure this will give the posts a sense of structure that they miss
  right now!)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I also plan to select from the less famous songs that I loved from that
  month, because I figure that you will eventually hear the popular ones. Like
  Sorry and Amsterdam from Broken Machine are blowing up on YouTube and you
  are probably going to hear it eventually!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>A response to The Coming Software Apocalypse (an article on The Atlantic)</title>
   <link href="/2017/10/02/response-to-software-apocalypse"/>
   <updated>2017-10-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/10/02/response-to-software-apocalypse</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/&quot;&gt;The Coming Software
Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;,
an article on The Atlantic published on 26th September, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach that the article suggests for programming is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_design&quot;&gt;Model-based
design&lt;/a&gt;. I would like to cover
some of my own past experiences with bugs that existed in the code I wrote and
how the lack of confidence in the foolproof-ness of a piece of software leads to
hours spent in thorough (not exhaustive) testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-undefined-leads-to-15000-emails&quot;&gt;1. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; leads to 15,000 emails&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past summer at Elanic, there was a typical problem in the ExpressJS
based backend that powered the primary REST API that runs the Elanic mobile
applications. There were three ways for a user to sign-up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. Using their Facebook account
b. Using their Google account
c. Using an email ID and a password&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(c) was majorly used on the iOS application where OAuth2 logins weren’t yet
implemented. The issue was that when a user signed up using an email ID and a
password, the email ID wasn’t verified. i.e. people could sign up with fake
email IDs like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fake@example.com&lt;/code&gt; and get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving this is pretty straight forward. When a user signs up, check if they are
signing up with type (c) and then, send them an email with a link that consists
of a verification token. When they click on the link, we will get the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt;
request and using the token we can mark their account as verified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the email ID doesn’t exist or is not controlled by them, then they will never
be able to verify their email. EEZY PEEZY!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AffectionateDecisiveEchidna-size_restricted.gif&quot; alt=&quot;gif-easy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about it a bit more and realised that there is one more case in which
we would want to verify the user’s email and that is in when the user updates
their profile and changes the email from there. In that case as well, we would
have to verify the new email ID. (And if required, send an email to the old
email ID informing them that the email ID has been changed. This wasn’t
required.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now there are two places we want to send the verification email: (a) when
the user signs up with an email (b) when the user updates their email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the way the code was structured, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserProfile&lt;/code&gt; model had a function
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserProfile.updateProfile({ filter, update, options }, callback)&lt;/code&gt; and that was the
right place for this code to be. Primarily because &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;updateProfile&lt;/code&gt; was being
called from across the application, and if in the future a flow is introduced
where the email might change from somewhere else, this would take care of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I wrote something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The routes looked like this (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server.js&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// POST /users&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Creating a new user&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;PostUsers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;UserProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sendVerificationEmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;201&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// PUT /users/:id&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Edit a user&apos;s profile&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;PutUsers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UserProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;updateProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(...)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the model function &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;updateProfile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UserProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;updateProfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sendVerificationEmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mongo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I have spoiled the problems in the code for you, you probably found the
problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the first line of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserProfile.updateProfile&lt;/code&gt;! I check if the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;update.email&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; or not. While I was writing this, I was convinced
that this will check if the email has changed, because there would be no point
to send the unchanged email alongwith a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; call right? Why waste bytes on the
wire for things that haven’t changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I got hit right in the face! Turns out &lt;strong&gt;BOTH&lt;/strong&gt; the Android and the iOS
application send email alongwith the PUT call and let the backend deal with the
change (or not). Worse still, even PUT calls from an internal tool called the
“administrator panel” also sent this parameter! And internally, profiles are
edited a lot to change tags, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the next 4 days, there were nearly 15,000 emails sent out of the Mail
exchange. Several frequent users who had their profiles being edited from the
internal tool received the “verify your email” mail multiple times, as high as
20 even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the simplest features to implement, but there was still some
nuance! &lt;strong&gt;THAT&lt;/strong&gt; is the reason this experience stuck with me, even 3 months
later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-my-ongoing-struggle-with-merge-sort&quot;&gt;2. My ongoing struggle with Merge Sort&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been implementing sorting and those kind of things for quite a while now.
I keep re-implementing them just to keep up-to-date and warmed up in my primary
langauge for competitive programming: C (although I write it in a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.cpp&lt;/code&gt; file
and compile it using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;g++&lt;/code&gt;, more on that later)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I implement Merge sort, I almost always start with the function
signature &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;int * merge(int *arr, int n)&lt;/code&gt; whereas the actual signature should be
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;int * merge(int *arr, int begin, int end)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first signature can still be worked, but I like the second one for it’s
verbosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you find the middle as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;middle = (end + begin) / 2&lt;/code&gt; and call merge on the
first and the second halves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there’s no particular bug here, I am just stressing on how although I
know this algorithm inside-out, I still need to write it and test it with a
couple of arrays before I can integrate it into my larger file. (The few times I
was over confident about it and directly started building atop the merge sort I
wrote and thought worked, I spent a significant amount of time going back and
forth and finally realising that I had flaked out in the first function I
wrote!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final code has been buggy in fairly limited instances. Through the
development process, of course, there are several basic mistakes I make and
discover and fix and move on. The iterative process that is so common is the one
I subscribe to as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of points about the article,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Newcombe isn’t so sure that it’s the programmer who is to blame. “I’ve heard
from Leslie that he thinks programmers are afraid of math. I’ve found that
programmers aren’t aware—or don’t believe—that math can help them handle
complexity. Complexity is the biggest challenge for programmers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what programmer is “afraid” of math. Anyone who comes from an
engineering background or any core science background is almost definitely not
“afraid” of math. If he particularly means Finite Automata and FSMs (which they
talk about in the article as being the holy grail for programming, sort of. Read
the article for the full picture) then even that is incredibly common. Anyone
who has taken an engineering course with an interest in Programming (even those
who don’t have a major in Computer Science) will definitely do a course on
Switching and Finite Automata or Formal Language and Automata or Finite State
Machines themselves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one thing in the article though, which I think appears fiercely to
everyone who writes code for a living:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Programmers, as a species, are relentlessly pragmatic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Samsung SM-B313E/D - Flashing software and getting out of a fix</title>
   <link href="/2017/09/26/samsung-flashing-software-b313"/>
   <updated>2017-09-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/09/26/samsung-flashing-software-b313</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It all started with this tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/910770407925415936&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2017-09-21-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a Samsung SM-B313E/D. I forgot the password and it was actually really
disturbing because I couldn’t depend on myself to remember the several other
passwords when I forgot a 4-digit password for an old phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That aside, I needed a way to fix this. There are &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; tutorials to do this
on the Internet. A selection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ty7NtFmreo&quot;&gt;Tutorial 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKGAi67MVMg&quot;&gt;Tutorial 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZelWOJTa6M&quot;&gt;Tutorial 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX50jYZXJwc&quot;&gt;Tutorial 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was something peculiar about each of these ones. The phone that I am
talking about is a really cheap phone (~ Rs. 2000 or USD 40) and thus there were
no “high quality” tutorials for this, as one might expect for a smart phone like
the Sony Xperia L or a Nexus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the tutorials showed more or less the same tutorial, but I was still not
completely sure that I would be able to recover my phone using the tutorial.
Also, being pretty paranoid myself, I saw no reason why they would not just ask
you to run some EXE file on your Windows computer with administrator privileges
and hide a virus inside that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to take the plunge, mainly because I had run out of options. Samsung
Service Centers are not the best places to go to in the world if you want quick
resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process was simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install the Spreadtrum Driver Package&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.pac&lt;/code&gt; file which has the software packet for this phone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a software to flash this PAC file onto the phone (I found an
&lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2624918&quot;&gt;XDA&lt;/a&gt; thread about
this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The verdict is that I was able to get the phone working once again! It works
fine now, and there was really nothing off about the tutorial. I used Tutorial
number 4 from the videos listed above. But for some reason the ResearchDownload
tool linked in that video didn’t work for me. So I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://spdflashtool.com/&quot;&gt;their
website&lt;/a&gt; and downloaded the latest one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another weird thing was that the PAC File that I recieved said that the software
was for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SC6530_SAMSUNG: b310e&lt;/code&gt;, but it worked for B313E/D. This was one thing
that I was most fearful about: that the wrong software would fry the phone. It
didn’t! I guess the software packages are close enough replicas of each other to
not make much of a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s certainly a difference in the software packages. In the earlier software
that was there on the phone, I could select multiple message and mark them as
read. Now I can’t, I can only delete them. So, the software has definitely
changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a success story. My heart &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; racing when the SPD Flash Tool was
doing it’s thing, but it worked out fine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tutorial 4 from above&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SPD Flash Tool’s website: http://spdflashtool.com/ (I think this is the
official one, but I can’t really  be sure. There are several mirrors of this
software out there)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The PAC file and the drivers from Tutorial 4 above worked for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a Windows 8 computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that I should probably put a disclaimer here, just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Primer (2004) - A somewhat better summary with a sequence of events</title>
   <link href="/2017/09/19/primer-2-second-post"/>
   <updated>2017-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/09/19/primer-2-second-post</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;spoilers-dont-read-if-you-havent-watched-the-movie&quot;&gt;Spoilers, don’t read if you haven’t watched the movie&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/movies/primer/sci-fi/mind-bending/2017/09/10/primer-2004/&quot;&gt;my first
post&lt;/a&gt;
about Primer, I have watched the movie a few times. I have read some of the
recent (and even old) threads on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Primer/&quot;&gt;r/primer&lt;/a&gt;. I
think I understand everything a bit better now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-first-revision-from-abes-perspective&quot;&gt;The First Revision from Abe’s perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to draw a complete timeline from the beginning is not that useful, but
turns out to be the easiest way to understand the details of the movie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sunday late night: Abe1 turns on the failsafe box with a few hourse delay and
  then goes to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monday 8:30 am: Abe1 turns the box on, proceeds to the hotel and stays there
  (he remains unreachable via his work or cell number, as Aaron1 says)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monday 8:50: Abe2 emerges from the box, there will be 2 Abes for the next 6
  hours.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monday ~11 am: Abe2 goes to Aaron1 and tells him about the machine. He shows
  him the Protein buildup thing, in Aaron1’s office. Aaron1’s colleague tells
  him that he should tell Will that the Ariel meeting is pushed to Wednesday.
  Aaron1 goes to talk to Will while Abe2 gets the car round front. Abe2 ends
  up inviting Will to Robert’s birthday party. Will is also going to bring his
  cousin along. This cousin is Rachel’s ex-boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;They now proceed to the lab where they see the protein buildup people.  They
  go back to the “shop” and put their watches in, they realise what it is.
  Aaron plays basketball, he says they can publish. Abe2 and Aaron1 then get
  something to eat / drink and stop their car in front of the storage space
  place near freeway. It’s now approximately 3:15 pm&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monday 3:15 pm: Abe1 walks into the storage space alongwith his Oxygen tank,
  while Abe2 and Aaron1 watch. “Who’s that, Abe?”, Aaron asks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monday ~3:25 pm: Aaron1 and Abe2 go to the room and see the machine. The
  machine is turned off. Abe1 is going back in time inside the box. They don’t
  disturb anything, and leave after some time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monday ~4:00 pm: Aaron1 and Abe2 are sitting in the car next to Aaron1’s
  truck. Abe2 gets a phone call from Rachel, he probably tells her that he’s
  going to be at Robert’s birthday party during this conversation. This is the
  reason Rachel appears at the birthday party. Abe2 and Aaron1 are washing
  dishes at home, they do NOT go to the party.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monday (before they return home for dinner and dishes): Abe2 and Aaron1 sit
near the airport and discuss what Abe1 did. Presumably, they also build the box
that Aaron is going to use. (1)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tuesday 8:30 am: Abe2 and Aaron1 turn the box on, spend 6 hours at the hotel.
  They use Abe2’s car to get to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tuesday 8:49 am: Abe3 and Aaron2 emerge from the box! They take Aaron’s truck
  to go to Abe’s house.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tuesday before 12:30 pm: Abe3 and Aaron2 buy stocks of RGWU, the price is
  going to double in afternoon trading. They are going to make a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tuesday 3:15 pm: Abe2 and Aaron1 turn the box off, about 5 minutes later, they
  get into the box and start travelling back in time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tuesday 3:15 pm: Abe3 and Aaron2 are watching their doubles Abe2 and Aaron1
  walk into the storage facility. The machines are running now, but their
  doubles will shortly turn them off.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tuesday evening: Abe3 and Aaron2 discuss with Kara about what they would do if
  they had a lot of money etc. This is the point where Aaron2 puts the idea
  out there: “Punch Platts and tell myself not to”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Notably, probably tongue in cheek, Kara’s dialogue: “My husband, the hero”
  (knowing what’s going to happen next, this might very well have been the
  seed that planted in Aaron2’s mind that he can actually go back and change
  the party, although I wonder if Aaron2 (a) knows about the failsafe machine
  that would let him go back that far in time (b) knows about the shenanigans
  that Rachel’s ex-boyfriend pulls at Robert’s party. The whole day they have
  more or less not spoken to anyone, so I am skeptical on this.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, Kara asked Aaron (no number, because to Kara there’s only
  one Aaron) to call pest control to clean the Attic out. But Aaron2 says that
  they are only birds and doesn’t call them. Is this because he really
  believes that they are birds, or because he knows that there’s an Aaron in
  the attic? (clarity on this later!)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(When does the grocery shopping scene and the petrol bunk scene happen? Tuesday
evening, Wednesday morning?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wednesday morning, 8:30 am: Abe3 and Aaron2 are going to take the trip again.
They talk about how Aaron could tell Kara about it. The machines have been set
to turn on at 8:45 am. Interestingly, one thing they do differently this time
is that they take Aaron’s truck to the hotel instead of Abe’s car. Probably
because Aaron wants to fill it up with gas? That seems to fit.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;So, austensibly, the petrol bunk scene happens on Wednesday morning. (?)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wednesday morning, 8:49 am: Abe4 and Aaron3 emerge from the box. Aaron3’s ear
  is bleeding, Abe4’s hand is. They talk about the dream and the tides that
  both of them seem to hear inside the box.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Notably, this time, Abe4 and Aaron3 have taken Abe’s car instead of Aaron’s
  truck to return to Abe’s house.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wednesday afternoon: Abe3 and Aaron2 are at the library, still talking about
telling Kara, flying to Costa Rica, etc. They decide to not tell anyone
though.  Aaron2 also mentions the innocuous “build a bigger box, because this
one feels like a coffin” The word coffin will be re-used and is important.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wednesday 3:15 pm: Abe3 and Aaron2 get into the box once again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And now, Aaron has become the hero&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wednesday late night: Abe4 goes to Aaron3’s house and tells him about the
  Platts plan. They come out, see Granger, follow him around. Granger is now
  in a coma.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thursday early morning: 3 days and 22 hourse after the failsafe (not the
  original one, as Abe expects it to be, because Aaron has used it in
  between) was turned on, Abe4 gets into it alongwith the 3 oxygen tanks, water
  and the triazolam for his next 4 days inside the box. He is going to use the
  reset button, go back in time and not tell Aaron about any of this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till now, things were linear. Suddenly, there’s the scene where Aaron went to
Robert’s birthday party. From Aaron’s dialogue later in the movie, we know that
there were two versions of the party:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The one which Aaron didn’t go to&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The one which Aaron went to and rushed Will (the ex-boyfriend)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) happened only once. (2) happens again and again, as the narrator
illustrates. Aaron re-does it until he gets everything perfect, exactly as he
wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the timeline when Aaron does go to the party, which is what the world will
remember because the final revision does have Aaron going to the party. In that
revision, Aaron goes to the party on Monday night. Abe may or may not go with
him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-second-revision-from-abes-perspective&quot;&gt;The Second Revision from Abe’s perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sunday late night: Abe1 turns on the failsafe box with a few hours delay. He
  then goes back home, and sleeps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sunday late night: Abe4 emerges from the box. He goes to his own house and
  eliminates himself because that is the only way to take control of the
  timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monday morning: The box remains unused, Abe has probably decided to not use
  the box because he has seen the consequences and is definitely unnerved by
  them. He believes that Aaron doesn’t know about the box yet because he
  hasn’t yet told him about it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monday afternoon: Abe goes to talk to Aaron, probably planning to tell him
that he was unable to understand the “box” and they should move on with some
other project because they have clearly hit a wall with this one. Instead, 
He faints because of his long, 3 day, no-food-just-water hiatus inside the
box. Aaron-n, meanwhile, has a recording of the day’s conversations and is
going to try and redo everything as it is to reverse engineer the party moment
and be the hero once again.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Aaron knows about the box whereas Abe believes that he doesn’t. Now, the HOW
section will start making sense.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In this revision, Abe knows about the box. Aaron knows about the box as well.
This is the atmost information symmetry that they have ever had.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Abe knows it’s consequences, having gone till Thursday. Aaron-n doesn’t, he
hasn’t gone till Thursday early morning when Abe uses the failsafe.
Nonetheless, he knows what happens till the night of the birthday party.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As the narrator says, “At this point, there would have been some discussion”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*1: I feel like they are sort of stretching it here. They discuss what he did,
plan their next morning. Apart from they also have to build a completely new box
for Aaron1 to use the next morning. They don’t go the party the first time, so
this gave them something like 7-8 hours to do everything and get back home, have
dinner with Kara and Lauren, do the dishes, and wake up next morning to execute
the plan. Since they didn’t go to the party, and Abe was around to tell him
exactly how to build the box, this might very well be possible. It just feels
really fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one big question I have now is &lt;strong&gt;How did Aaron find out about the failsafe?
When did he use it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he did use it, he went to Aaron’s house right after emerging from the
failsafe (Aaron in the Hoodie), he drugs the milk and puts Aaron in the attic.
Now, he is in control. The first time Aaron goes back, he records the
conversations of the day. The next time he goes back, he brings the recordings
with him, and then follows the script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also brings back a coffin with him at one point, because then, he can emerge
from the box, start the coffin up and then go on with his Monday morning. That
way, he will always be able to go back to Sunday morning. ( &lt;strong&gt;Remember&lt;/strong&gt; that as
soon as someone emerges from a box, they can’t turn it off. They MUST wait till
atleast the time the machine has been turned off, their double has gotten in and
it has cooled down before they can start it again. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is the meaning of
&lt;em&gt;one-time use only&lt;/em&gt;, they can use it only one time to go back to a particular
point in time, the point when they start the machine. )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, when Aaron comes back the first time, he drugs his double and puts him
in the attic, but he can’t &lt;em&gt;keep&lt;/em&gt; doing that. Starting from the second time, the
Aaron who was already there convinces the Aaron who just emerged from the box to
leave town so that he can continue on his plan. Seeing that the narrator left,
it’s fair to assume that most of the Aarons would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/movies/primer/sci-fi/mind-bending/2017/09/10/primer-2004/&quot;&gt;my previous
post&lt;/a&gt;,
at the end of it, I ask a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q1: Granger, how did he come back?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started to believe that Granger’s appearance is a jarring reminder to Abe
and Aaron that they are NOT prescient because they might know the past, to the
last point in a basketball game, but they have no control over their future
selves who might do whatever they think is fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q2: Fail-safe, who built this machine? Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, Abe built the first Failsafe. While building a machine, knowing what
the machine was doing, he built two machines and turned one on before Monday.
Probably Sunday late night. Now, he has the ability to go back to Sunday late
night and not tell anyone about anything, if he so wishes by taking care of his
double. He would &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to kill him / incapicitate him, so as to take control
of his character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, by all accounts, Aaron used the machine before Abe had the chance to.
This is the debt that Aaron owes Abe (I think), that the narrator alludes to
“Now, I have repaid any debt I may have owed you”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q3: What is the exact sequence of events?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried to answer this for the first part of the movie and that part is
very clear to me now. There are a new set of questions though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does Aaron find out about the failsafe? Why did he go to the storage
facility and look at the manifest without Abe being with him? Did he go there
so he could build his own failsafe and put it in another room, just as Abe
did and happened to notice the two rooms registered to Abe?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When does Aaron use the failsafe? Does he use it on Tuesday night?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Primer (2004) - Watch 1, impressions and questions</title>
   <link href="/2017/09/10/primer-2004"/>
   <updated>2017-09-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/09/10/primer-2004</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/primer-poster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;poster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well. This movie is one hell of a mind-bender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;major-spoilers-ahead&quot;&gt;MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a great movie that you don’t want spoiled. Watch it yourself and you
will have a GREAT experience trying to figure everything out. (Not that I am
there yet, but I have a feeling it will be great!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I didn’t understand everything. I sort-of have a sketch of what
really happened, but I am not sure on the details, and the last 15 minutes of
the movie totally went over my head. For this watch, I am just going to list the
things that I could make out. This definitely simplifies the plot, but the
specifics are still hard to get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is Abe:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/primer-abe.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;And Aaron:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/primer-aaron.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Abe’s girlfriend is Rachel Granger, and her dad Thomas Granger is “their last,
best hope of funding”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Aaron’s wife is Kara. They have a daughter Lauren.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Philip and Robert are two people who appear in the first scene, and once
after. They don’t really matter (as for this viewing), so they can be safely
ignored. It’s only Abe and Aaron who matter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They don’t like / hate Robert Platt. This is something related to the funding,
  it got pulled or something. The hate is important because Aaron, who is
  generally defending him, later proposes an idea where he can punch Platt
  once, but then stop himself from doing it. Thus, having experienced the
  punch but not having to live in a world where there would be consequences.
  More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chronologically, there’s some science-y stuff and they build &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. It’s
  not really clear what they are building. The mass of objects they keep
  inside decreases after some time. At a first run, the machine just sort of
  runs smoothly for a bit but when they run it again for the box, the machine
  vibrates a lot and then just stops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon after the first run, Abe is asleep at his place, at 7 pm. Whether it’s
  already started, I can not tell. There are two people on his couch, Brad and
  the “Man on the Couch”. This again stumps me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, Aaron shows Abe a mechanism with which he has a stable method to
  reduce the mass of something by 10%. Still quiet unclear about what’s really
  going on. They also notice that unplugging the batteries keeps the machine
  going for a few minutes before it shuts down. They call this “blocking
  gravity” inside the box.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, about 20 minutes into the film, is where the looping begins. We aren’t
  really sure who it is, but &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; Abe walks out into the terrace of an office
  building. The camera fades into the shot of Abe walking towards an Aaron.
  So, the walking Abe might not be the same as the terrace Abe, and actually,
  I think they aren’t the same. It is worth noting here (and I just realised
  this) that the first time this happened, Aaron was NOT able to reach Abe the
  whole day on his work or cell because Abe is already doing this every day!
  He’s already called in sick, and has left his cell phone making him
  unreachable, and maintaining the perfect symmetry each day. This happens
  somewhere around noon because after this, Abe takes Aaron to the protein
  thing, shows him all of that, then they go to the lab where they do the
  watch thing, and finally, when they have eaten, it’s 315 and Abe is walking
  into the storage shed to lie there for the next six hours to come out as a
  new Abe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the end of the movie, it’s clear that the Aaron sitting on the bench with
  the headphones, is listening to the conversation that’s about to happen.
  There had to have been a time when it happened for the first time, or the
  second. As the narrator says at around 64 minutes, the second time Aaron
  came back, “It wasn’t so easy. He didn’t expect me to put up a fight. But I
  realised he simply wanted it more. He had already performed the tasks I had
  intended to, of recording the conversations of the day, as I had intended
  to.” So, the second time Aaron came back was when he met the narrator,
  fought with him and took the narrator. &lt;strong&gt;Who is the narrator?&lt;/strong&gt; (That’s a
  question I have been unable to answer, still)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The night of Robert’s birthday party is the same day as the time when Abe
  tells Aaron for the first time what the machine really does, the same day
  that they put the watch into the machine for the first time and figure out
  what it really does. The same day with the protein build-up sequence. Rachel
  goes to the birthday because Abe asks her to, and Rachel’s ex-boyfriend shows
  up with one of Aaron’s friends. The ex-boyfriend brings a shotgun out and
  Aaron rushes him, eventually saving everyone. They call him “the hero” for
  doing this. Abe reprimands him at having done this without thinking about
  Kara and Lauren. The first time that this happens in the movie, Aaron
  doesn’t have headphones plugged in, which leads me to believe that this
  reprimand from Abe is the first time that Aaron even does this, and Abe is
  NOT at the party this first time because he doesn’t know about it and has to
  hear about it from Robert. He decides to go to the party after he knows
  what’s going to happen there, Abe definitely does NOT go to the party the
  first time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This particular event becomes an obsession with Aaron and Aaron seems to
  keep repeating this sequence, again and again until he is satisfied with how
  events turn out. As the narrator says, this might have taken 3 or 4 times or
  even more. No one can say. This sequence, and the constant changing of
  what’s happening seems to be what makes the two of them come undone from the
  routine they had going which made a lot of money but didn’t have any
  recognition from anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time the protein buildup scene comes up, Aaron is wearing the
  headphones, which means it’s not the first time he’s going through it. He’s
  actually already gone through it once and is simply following the script to
  keep everything the same.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scene in the movie where the put the watch in and notice the 1300 thing,
  doesn’t have Aaron with the headphones which perhaps means that that is the
  first time that that happened. Note that by this time, the human sized box
  already exists and is in the storage shed. Abe has already built it. Aaron
  still is only &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; the box, whereas Abe has gone ahead, built the
  box, gone back in time, and is NOW explaining the box to Aaron. (while
  Aaron’s equivalent Abe in this world is actually seen by Aaron walking into
  the storage shed at the time they walk in through the binoculars)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, clearly Abe has been doing this more times than Aaron has. Abe also
  figures out that he can make money by simply figuring out which stock grew
  the most in the last 6 hours, then go back, get out of the box and buy that
  stock. &lt;strong&gt;Essentially, starting 830 am, Abe and Aaron spend 6 hours in the
  hotel, 6 hours in the machine and were able to go back in time, to
  eventually get out of the box at 850 am.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a small drawing I made of how the double really comes to be:
  (wherever there are two lines overlapping, the doubles co-exist)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/primer-drawing-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s about all I have time for now. There are still several things that are
unexplained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thomas Granger: What’s he doing? Why’s he following them? How did he travel
  back 2 or 3 days? Why would they even let him know about the machine or let
  him use it?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fail-safe: Who built this machine? Why did he build it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The killing in the failsafe machine’s room, Abe kills someone. Is it Abe
  killing himself or Abe killing Aaron? I am leaning towards the former.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the exact sequence of the way stuff goes down?&lt;/strong&gt; (This is the
  question that will finally hold the answer!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this is a GREAT movie.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Auxilliary material for TLS 1.2 - TLS Parameters - Registries</title>
   <link href="/2017/09/07/tls-12-aux"/>
   <updated>2017-09-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/09/07/tls-12-aux</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of the TLS explanation series: Auxilliary material&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After understanding the TLS handshake, there are still many moving parts that
have still not been satisfactorily explained. Perhaps the most important in
those is the assignment of the byte values for each of the cipher suites,
handshake message numbers, etc to the different things that have predefined
lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are defined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml&quot;&gt;TLS
Parameters&lt;/a&gt;
document, maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). If you
didn’t already know, the IANA is also responsible for allocating Autonomous
Systems on the Internet backbone which is used for routing packets around the
network. They are the ones who have cordoned off
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bgp.he.net/AS22799&quot;&gt;10.0.0.0/8&lt;/a&gt; and some other IPs for LAN usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this document consists of several registries. I will try to cover some
of the common ones that I understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cipher Suite Registry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most frequently changed registries, this registry keeps
getting new Cipher Suites added to it, and the corresponding byte value for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also mentions the RFC where we can find the reference for it. The
reference consists of a short description of the algorithm, and the associated
Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) to be used. The PRF, as you might remember, is used
to generate the keys for the actual Record layer message transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common cipher suite on the web is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256&lt;/code&gt;.
It is being used on this website by the Cloudfare SSL proxy. Breaking down this
Cipher Suite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Key exchange is done using ECDHE&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Key exchange is authenticated using ECDSA&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bulk encryption will be done using AES_128_GCM which is authenticated
  inherently&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PRF used will be the TLS PRF with SHA256 as the hash function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last point comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5289#section-3.2&quot;&gt;RFC 5289, section
3.2&lt;/a&gt;. So, for every cipher
suite this whole thing is defined. Again, we see that the emphasis is less on
making all the data available at the same place and more on (a) making sure
there’s no implementation ambiguity and (b) making sure the system is massively
extensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handshake Type Registry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siddharthkannan.in/tls-handshake/SAMPLE_NEW.html&quot;&gt;actual session
negotiations&lt;/a&gt; in
Wireshark (or the transcript linked), you will know that each Handshake protocol
message has 1 byte (= 8 bits) to indicate which Handshake message it is. This
registry assigns those numbers, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClientHello&lt;/code&gt; is fittingly 1 and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finished&lt;/code&gt;
is 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signature Algorithm Registry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Hash Algorithm Registry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These again are single byte values which have been defined for easy reference to
each of these algorithms, without explicitly using strings etc. NEAT! (Packet
sniffers like Wireshark take this into account and print the algorithm in the
human readable form for convenience!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exporter Label Registry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is yet another registry which has a &lt;em&gt;very, very&lt;/em&gt; specific purpose. It
stores the list of strings which can be used by protocols that wish to export
TLS’s keying material to their own layers.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5705#section-6&quot;&gt;This section&lt;/a&gt; neatly sums up the
importance and the application of this registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These applications imply a need to be able to export keying material (later
called Exported Keying Material or EKM) from TLS/DTLS to an application or
protocol residing at an upper layer, and to securely agree on the upper-layer
context where the keying material will be used.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understanding and Explaining the TLS Handshake</title>
   <link href="/2017/08/29/tls-handshake"/>
   <updated>2017-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/08/29/tls-handshake</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I open sourced
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siddharthkannan.in/tls-handshake/&quot;&gt;tls-handshake&lt;/a&gt;, a web page that
tries to provide an over view of the TLS 1.2 handshake at an abstraction level
that is appropriate for students who have taken basic cryptography courses
either at the college or school level. It has been one hell of a ride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea came from my lack of understanding of the TLS 1.2 handshake, I really
had very less of a clue about what was going on. I often checked certificates,
especially on banking and merchant websites where I was entering sensitive
credentials. This had become more of a habit. But I was only checking the trust
chain of certificates, and the fingerprint and if the browser was giving me any
warnings about it all. I didn’t really know &lt;em&gt;what was really&lt;/em&gt; going on
underneath everything, the math!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1882/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/color_models.png&quot; alt=&quot;xkcd&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one obvious place to start: &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246&quot;&gt;IETF RFC 5246: TLS
1.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spec is a dense 100-page document that goes over everything in
implementation-level detail, i.e detail enough to ensure that any person who is
implementing a TLS 1.2 client OR server faces absolutely no ambuiguity. The RFCs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;go through a long process in which the TLS Working Group makes updates to them,
their mailing list is a great place to hang out if you have a few hours on your
hand and want to spend them learning more about how the next HTTPS spec gets
written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFC 5246 is a great document, &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; you know a few basics that the document
itself doesn’t touch on. These include some common cryptography concepts like
asymmetric and symmetric cryptography, digital signature algorithms, the
Diffie-Hellman Key exchange system. Apart from the mathematics of these which
the RFC doesn’t attempt to explain or ellaborate over, the RFC is self
sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siddharthkannan.in/tls-handshake/SAMPLE_NEW.html&quot;&gt;simple new session packet
capture&lt;/a&gt; should be
enough to tell you about the different set of messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This screenshot from the RFC itself, which I noticed quite late in my reading
will tell you the sequence in which these messages are sent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/tls-handshake-overview.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few hours should be enough for you to understand the over-all flow of the
information that is being exchanged and the different places that you might end
up in, after each message is sent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is when I was ready to start writing the webpage. After beating around for
a few minutes about a good UI to show everything, I decided to stick to text and
simple HTML as much as I could, and use Markdown to format everything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I absolutely wanted to have was informal “Purpose” sentences for each
message. Mainly because the TLS handshake is just a secure way for two people to
talk, in a public place like a train or a bus station and without spelling it
out, and share a message that they don’t want anyone else to know about. They
have never met before. And both of them are pretty good at mathematics that
involves huge primes, or elliptic curve points, whichever one is to your taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s sort of my story behind the “TLS Handshake” explanation page! I posted it
on r/https (which is a pretty dormant subreddit), I might post it on Hackernews
soon, once I can take some time off and go back to read the whole thing and be
sure that there’s nothing wrong that’s written there.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Music update - July 2017</title>
   <link href="/2017/08/12/july-music-update"/>
   <updated>2017-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/08/12/july-music-update</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The past month has been pretty good in terms of the amount of new music that I
have heard (although the albums are pretty old themselves)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-suburbs---arcade-fire---2010&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Suburbs_(album)&quot;&gt;The Suburbs - Arcade Fire - 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/suburbs-album-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album won the Grammy Album of the Year award in 2010. Before this, I had
heard only the second track, Ready to Start. That I absolutely loved, but after
listening to the whole album, I am thoroughly spoiled now and I don’t know what
to pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We Used to Wait, Sprawl I, Sprawl II: I am not inseparable from these three now.
The two Sprawls tie seamlessly into each other. And We Used to Wait is &lt;strong&gt;such&lt;/strong&gt;
a strong throw-back to the time before smartphones were ubiquitous. (I was born
in 1996, so I might not be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; old, but I certainly remember the time before
all smartphones had great cameras and everyone was posting photos all the time
a.k.a the pre-Instagram pre-LTE world)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These few lines from We Used to Wait, I connected with rather too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/suburbs-we-used-to-wait.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I made that with Gimp and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized&quot;&gt;Solarized
color&lt;/a&gt; scheme.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City with No Children, Month of May, Modern Man, Rococo and Speaking in Tongues
are also great songs! The more I listen to this album, the more I realise how
good it is &lt;em&gt;as a package&lt;/em&gt;, as a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a paragraph from Sprawl I:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Cops shone their lights
On the reflectors of our bikes,
Said, &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do &lt;/span&gt;you kids know what &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;time &lt;/span&gt;it is?
Well sir, it&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;s the **first time I&apos;&lt;/span&gt;ve felt like something is mine&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;,
Like I have something to give.
The last defender of the sprawl.
Said, well where &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do &lt;/span&gt;you kids live?
Well sir, &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;**if &lt;/span&gt;you only knew what the answer&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;s worth**,
Been searching,
every corner,
of the Earth.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprawl I is the shortest full track in the album and it has barely three
paragraphs of lyrics and yet, it manages to capture so much of the singer’s
emotions in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I totally saw all the Suburbs interviews that Arcade Fire did in 2010,
especially with Regine. * _ * )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nothing-but-thieves---nothing-but-thieves---2015&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_but_Thieves_(album)&quot;&gt;Nothing but Thieves - Nothing but Thieves - 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/nbt-album-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing but Thieves is fairly new and they started only in 2012 and their only
album was released in 2015. Recently, their new song
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2zcG3bcuMI&quot;&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; has been really popular
on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, this whole album is really bass-heavy and a few of the songs
have a leading bass guitar track (especially, Wake Up Call and Honey Whiskey)
and in every song the bass guitar is clearly audible, you don’t even have to
strain, provided you are on a fairly bassy speaker system. (My little JBL In-Ear
headphones haven’t really felt bass ever, so when listening on them, the bass
feels significantly cut. Funnily enough, that’s how I realised how bass-heavy
this album is!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t choose favourites yet because all of the songs are groovy and there’s
no one song that I clearly don’t like. I specifically like Excuse Me, Itch,
Honey Whiskey, Hostage, and Trip Switch. It’s a 16 track deluxe album and I have
named 5 already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I Get High and Neon Brother are slightly away from the over-all tone of the
album but if you don’t listen to them as an album and rather as singles, then
they too fit very well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. I started writing this post on 6th August and I have finished it today.
Since then, I have also heard Vampire Weekend’s Modern Vampires in the City.
It’s a 2013 cheerful, indie-rock album. It’s REALLY good!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Siege of Trencher's Farm vs. Straw Dogs (2011) - How loose an adaptation is it?</title>
   <link href="/2017/07/23/straw-dogs-trenchers-farm"/>
   <updated>2017-07-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/07/23/straw-dogs-trenchers-farm</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just completed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10051695-the-siege-of-trencher-s-farm&quot;&gt;The Seige of Trencher’s
Farm&lt;/a&gt;
by Gordon Williams. I also just completed watching 2011 remake of the loose
adaptation Straw Dogs (2011).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fair-warning-huge-spoilers-ahead&quot;&gt;Fair Warning: HUGE Spoilers ahead.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adaptation is pretty loose, the whole sexual angle that Kate Bosworth brings
into the movie is completely non-existent in the book. There’s also a child in
the book, and Louise herself (George’s wife) doesn’t seem to have lived in
Trencher’s when she was a kid. She’s from England but not exactly from the place
that they have come to stay at for a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the book, George, Louise and Karen (8) come to stay at Trencher’s Farm
for a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same in the movie, only it’s Amy and David Sumner. To add some more to this, Amy
used to live in Blackwater and the farm is called the Wilcox Farm. Amy’s dad
used to stay here and she had a thing going with Charlie Venner, the local hunk
(played by the creepy-looking, tall Alexander Skarsgard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-boys-on-the-outside&quot;&gt;The boys on the outside&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The character names are quite similar. There’s the huge Tom Hedden (or Heddon),
a local drunk who used to be a coach in his day. In the book he has a huge
family that’s over-run with work and Janice Hedden is an &lt;em&gt;afflicted&lt;/em&gt; daughter of
his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Scutt is different though. Scutt is the one with the brains in the book.
He makes all the crucial decisions during the siege itself. In the movies, he’s
just a married man with a pregnant wife and he covets Amy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Cawsey is also different. In the book, Cawsey is some kind of a psychopath
who &lt;em&gt;likes&lt;/em&gt; killing animals and wants to get his knife into a human being. He is
seriously mentally ill and needs help for sure, but in Dando, outsiders can’t
come in to help. In the movie, he’s just a normal kid who’s hanging out and
idolizes Charlie for he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bert Voizey&lt;/strong&gt; is a character in the books that I am particularly fond of. One of
his introductory lines was incredibly funny and sad at the same time. It was
this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The third man - Bert Voizey - never felt comfortable in this kind of fancy
house. Like one of his own ferrets, he had a natural instinct for creeping
about in darker corners. He was not at ease with loud, confident people who
stared you straight in the eye when they talked to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We later learn that Bert posions rats for a living and he’s proud of this
because most people are freaked out by rats, but he understands them and does
doesn’t have to be scared of them. Bert is missing from the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bic is a character who’s only in the movie. He’s a pretty 1D character and
there’s not a lot to talk about with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, about all these male characters who organise and are on the outside,
there’s one summarising lines right before they start it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All of them thought of different things, yet they were all there for the same
reasons. They were the men nobody took notice of. They were the men who’d never
had any luck. All their lives other people had told them what to do, had
insulted them, put them in gaol, sneered at them, kept them poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a lot of this might not really be true, this is what drives them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-2-protagonists&quot;&gt;The 2 Protagonists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that talked about, we can finally come to the main two characters.
George and Louise. David and Amy. It’s important to understand two things,
according to me. I was pretty confused about their equation until almost the end
of the book and the movie. It’s different in both. So, here’s a good place to
branch out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;david--george&quot;&gt;David / George&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s an academic and wants to spend some time in a quiet, peaceful country side
home so that he can complete a book (script) that he’s working on. Being an
academic, he’s this ultra-modern husband character who’s always in control, who
never gets angry. This particular trait of his irritates and infuriates his wife
to no end. She wants to see some &lt;em&gt;color&lt;/em&gt; in him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He was so damned anxious to keep control of himself. He acted the role of a
reasonable steady, dependable husband. In her general state of unreasonable
resentment she saw this as an insult; if he was sincere he wouldn’t need to act,
to keep such tight control of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also really hard for him to acknowledge the fact that there are some things
that he simply can not do. Like when they find the cat’s corpse, he’s almost
exactly as disgusted and scared by it as his 8 year old daughter Karen. Louise
is the one who has to step up to take care of that particular problem. This kind
of un-manly behaviour in an old-fashioned sense that he seems to lack really
cuts him deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really comes out when he’s completely realised his situation during the
Siege. When he’s realised that he’s the man of the house and he HAS to take care
of his wife, his child and the child-like Niles, because, as he puts it himself,
&lt;strong&gt;They are my responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;. Although no one tasked him with it, he feels the
obligation to take control and ensure that everyone is safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing about him that he himself seems to not have track of is the fact
that his wife expects him to be an old-fashioned husband. A husband who beats
her when she disobeys or does something that he disapproves of, as masochistic
as it sounds, I don’t believe that Amy / Louise is masochistic. I think it’s the
responsibility wearing of. George says that it was his wife who took care of
everything when they moved to England. He wished he had done it, but doesn’t
seem to resent it too much. As soon as they are there though, Louise is probably
worn out from all the work that it must have taken to move a family of 3 from
the US to England. And perhaps she had this belief that once they were there,
George would take control and she could go back to being the person who followed
rules instead of having to make them. &lt;strong&gt;THAT&lt;/strong&gt; is the equation the couple share
and &lt;strong&gt;THAT&lt;/strong&gt; is the central question in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When someone is trying to get into YOUR house and hurt the people that YOU are
responsible for, TO WHAT LENGTHS WOULD YOU GO TO PROTECT THEM? DO YOU HAVE IT IN
YOU TO KILL, if that’s what it took?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like all those childhood fantasy situations that kids often put themselves
in and try to think about what they would do if they ever were there. eg: Man to
man, a gun in each hand, would you talk or would you shoot first and hope to God
your aim was right? eg: You are up against a guy who’s obviously physically
stronger than you, would you try to outwit him or would you fight him anyhow, in
your naive belief that the good people win?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a delightful book to read, if you really have the stomach for it. There’s a
lot of confusion and there’s a lot of pages that don’t tell you a lot about the
story, but that’s simply because you gotta love George and Louise if you must
understand WHY George goes to such lengths to protect Niles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amy--louise&quot;&gt;Amy / Louise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the male protagonist is somewhat similar between the two, the female
protagonist is completely different. There are some strands that are common
between the two, but more than that, it’s really hard to puzzle out what else is
common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy, played by Kate Bosworth, was the high school sweetheart. She always wanted
to get out of Blackwater. She finally did and went into the world and did an NBC
show that everyone in Blackwater watched. She’s larger than life for all of
them, she’s the girl who made it. Everyone in Blackwater respects her. But I
think that’s not the primary emotion they feel when they see her, the primary
emotion is &lt;strong&gt;resent&lt;/strong&gt;. Everyone resents her for having left her hometown. They
resent her for coming back to town with an &lt;em&gt;outsider&lt;/em&gt; and behave like she’s one
of them. Go to the baseball game, go to the church, with an &lt;em&gt;outsider&lt;/em&gt;. No one
takes well to that. Least of all, her high school boyfriend Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy herself is miffed at the want of passion in her husband. She dresses
ridiculously for her early morning runs, she wants her husband to take charge
and ask people why they were staring at her. I would actually go as far as
thinking that the fact that attracts her to Charlie more than anything is that
if she were married to Charlie then &lt;strong&gt;NO ONE&lt;/strong&gt; would have the guts to say or
watch her like they do. It’s only because she’s married to this Harvard
Academic, who’s never gone hunting, that she’s being stared at and she has lewd
comments passed on her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her outrageous stunt in the movie where she flashes to Cawsey, Scutt, Bic and
Charlie is one of the least subtle ways to strike a match. While Charlie’s been
getting that vibe, he’s not yet decided anything but after this scene, where he
is clearly surprised and shocked, he realises that she wants her (and in that
moment, she probably did want him) and decides to take things into his own
hands. The rape follows. Surprisingly, Norman is in on this also and I don’t
really know why Charlie lets him, but I guess it’s some sort of punishment for
Amy going out of Blackwater and marrying and coming back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louise, in the books, is a different character. A caring mother, all she is
miffed with is the lack of passion. The line in the David section, where she
wants him to show some passion, it’s clear that she thinks all of George is an
ACT, an act he puts on for the world, an act that he himself hides his true self
behind. She wants to get at him, she wants to provoke him into showing some
color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time George can bring himself to slap her, during the Siege when she’s
acting insensibly and not doing what he tells her to do, she uses the word
&lt;em&gt;relieved&lt;/em&gt; right after being hit. That’s what she wanted him to do. She wanted
him to TAKE CONTROL, so that she could stop feeling like the one who was making
all the decisions. This is some kind of post-moving-to-England trauma stuff
where the move was so stressful that all she wants to do now is lie around and
not do anything, while her husband takes care of the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louise is most certainly not as simple as that and I have oversimplified the
matter. But, that’s what I take away from her character. I think every reader
would have their own take-aways for a character like her!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;minor-differences&quot;&gt;Minor differences&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s boiling water in the book and boiling oil in the movie&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When George first hurts Cawsey and ties him to the window, he does it with
  a lot of hesitation because he is conscious of him stepping over the line
  from anger to violence. He says he despises it but realises the need for it
  and does it anyway. In the movie though, David uses a nail gun and nails
  Cawsey’s hands to the wall almost without thinking too much about it. And
  finally, he snarls at him, “I hope you slit your fucking throat.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the movie, Amy shoots Norman. It’s revenge for what he and Charlie did to
  her while they trick David into going hunting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Charlie has a gruesome death in the movie. That’s just a titbit of
  information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Switching to SuperTab; A new Crichton thriller, WHAT?!</title>
   <link href="/2017/07/02/ycm-to-supertab"/>
   <updated>2017-07-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/07/02/ycm-to-supertab</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started using Vim as my primary browser, I have been using
&lt;a href=&quot;vimawesome.com/plugin/YouCompleteMe&quot;&gt;YouCompleteMe&lt;/a&gt; as the completion plugin.
It works &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;, it is annoying because it tries to autocomplete &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt;
and sometimes that gets in the way of navigation using the arrow keys. In any
case, I was fairly happy with the plugin’s performance because it never really
slowed down my editing experience. Until a couple of weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was when I saw that the editor just hung for some amount of time, and it
was really trying to find suggestions for the word I was typing. This was really
hampering the time it took for me to actually write code. And thus, I set out on
my search for a better plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing about YCM that is slightly irritating is that it has a compiled
component. This compiled component doesn’t build on computers that have less
than 1 GB of RAM (Looking at you, $5 a month Digital Ocean droplets.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested &lt;a href=&quot;vimawesome.com/plugin/neocomplete-vim&quot;&gt;neocomplete.vim&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t
have a compiled component and has some really extensive configuration options.
That include using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as the key to confirm suggestions. That was rather
pleasant, perhaps when I have a computer with more RAM and a better processor,
neocomplete would be the option. (It is most certainly better than YCM, simply
the lack of compiled component ensures that!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to my own quandary, I found this new set of completion plugins that
show you suggestions but work on pressing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TAB&lt;/code&gt; button. It’s pretty
interesting, and I started using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ervandew/supertab&quot;&gt;SuperTab&lt;/a&gt;. I am still reserved about how
&lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; it is, perhaps I will report again after a few weeks of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also just started reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31287693-dragon-teeth&quot;&gt;Dragon Teeth - Michael
Crichton&lt;/a&gt;. It’s
really surprising that a new Crichton book was released less than a month ago,
seeing as Crichton himself died in 2008. I haven’t read up on the history but I
guess this manuscript was &lt;em&gt;discovered&lt;/em&gt;. I am about 50% through the book (one 5
hour train journey ensured that!) and it’s been riveting till now. The strange
antiquated habit of journaling really takes on a life of it’s own throughout the
book (as most of the narration is either the experience itself or what one of
the characters recorded in their journal).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Generating Git Punchcard plot from the terminal</title>
   <link href="/2017/06/22/improving-git-punchcard-plot"/>
   <updated>2017-06-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/06/22/improving-git-punchcard-plot</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Around 6 pm today, I found
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/guanqun/git-punchcard-plot&quot;&gt;guanqun/git-punchcard-plot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 10:45 pm, approximately 4 hours later (of which I spent rather less time
writing stuff, I opened &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/guanqun/git-punchcard-plot/pull/7&quot;&gt;PR
#7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I cloned the repository, I realised that you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to put the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git-punchcard&lt;/code&gt; python script in your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; for it to start working as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git
punchcard&lt;/code&gt;. I didn’t need any of that, I did &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to see a punchcard
though. So, I put it there, (&lt;strong&gt;Note 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Take path from the CLI if provided!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I generated the punchcard for a repository, it looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/punchcard-original.png&quot; alt=&quot;before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looked &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;. The opacity was a problem. I might have made fewer commits
during those times (this is the punchcard of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/blog/graphs/punch-card&quot;&gt;my blog
repository&lt;/a&gt; generated using
this utility). So, I also wanted to fix that so that the opacity of all the
circles will be 1 and the circles will all be black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing these two was rather easy. (I delved into one Cairo function and
searched and found &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;os.getcwd()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;os.chdir()&lt;/code&gt;) Now the punchcard looked more
like the one on GitHub, and pretty good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/punchcard-middle.png&quot; alt=&quot;middle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was about to open a PR to the repo, when I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/guanqun/git-punchcard-plot/issues/5&quot;&gt;Issue #5:
Timezones&lt;/a&gt;. It put forth
a rather interesting problem. You have collaborators working from different time
zones and you would like to figure out when they work, so you can plan upgrades
and also schedule meetings without asking them when they work. (decidedly more
cumbersome, but why not?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the part that ate up the most of my time. Understanding the internals
of the myriad utilities that Python has to work with Timestamps. There isn’t
just one module does everything. Oh no, that would be too easy. Instead, there
are atleast 4 modules: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;time&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;email.utils&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;calendar&lt;/code&gt;. Each of
them has a few functions and they all seem to seemlessly interop with each
other. It’s rather confusing and I was finally able to understand what functions
to use after considerable amount of moving around the documentation pages of all
these functions and an open Python shell. The code I wanted was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-py highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;formatdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;mktime_tz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;parsedate_tz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RFC_TIME_STR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FINAL_OFFSET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# -&amp;gt; This would give me a RFC 2882 compatible string
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final thing I added in because almost as soon as I had done all this, I
realised that the punchcard was for the &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; project lifetime which could be
years in a lot of cases. I needed some way to limit the period from which the
punchcard was being built. One look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_commit_limiting&quot;&gt;git-log’s commit
limiting&lt;/a&gt; documentation
made it obvious to me that tunnelling options to git would be the most flexible
option to go forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of options that git-log supports is &lt;strong&gt;rather extensive!&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the path I took to get the following punchcard of my 100 Days of
Writing project on this blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/punchcard-100daysofwriting.png&quot; alt=&quot;final&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the open PR is now on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/guanqun/git-punchcard-plot/pull/7&quot;&gt;Github at #7&lt;/a&gt;. If you
have the time, download the script on that branch and make some punchcards for
repositories that you work on or others work on. Maybe you will discover
something interesting about your colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Setting milestones to understand TLS</title>
   <link href="/2017/06/13/understanding-tls"/>
   <updated>2017-06-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/06/13/understanding-tls</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the TLS IETF draft. It’s 104 pages long, That’s as big as Rita
Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps my 100th attempt at reallt understanding the internals of how
TLS works. My end goal is simple here: I want to know how a secure channel is
established between a server and a client. I don’t want an
apples-and-oranges-are-fruits level understanding of it, I have that. I know
all the digital signature and public key cryptography analogies that are out
there. I want to be able to form a general idea of HOW each step works, why it
is required, and how that particular step fits in the larger scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with Wireshark and captured a default HTTPS handshake. I was able to
do this rather easily and create a pcap file. Now I atleast have that, which is
the ACTUAL packets going through the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order of messages is clear to me but I have decided to take it slow and
understand each message thoroughly before trying to put the pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was to give an analogy for this, like those that people always resort to
while explaining crypto to others, it would go something like this: I want to
understand what is there on each piece of the puzzle before trying to put it
together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First milestone: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Client Hello&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Server Hello&lt;/code&gt;. After this comes the more
intense cryptographic part, but these two are important for the decision of
which cipher suite to use. (my computer’s least favorite cipher suite uses
3DES, remember that?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on this series, hopefully. I am going to print some pages of the spec out
because that is probably the only way to keep my sanity and still learn
something useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some random thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Hello part of the exchange, both parties agree on four things: the key
exchange + signing algorithm, the bulk encryption algorithm, MAC function and a
pseudo-random function (PRF). Why are these used? Under my current model for
learning about TLS, at this stage, I am going to have to take for granted that
these four things are needed somewhere down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Learning React -> Understanding why Redux -> More time spent!</title>
   <link href="/2017/06/12/react-and-redux"/>
   <updated>2017-06-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/06/12/react-and-redux</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, I had this idea for an app. It’s a pretty basic app and it takes the current
location and prints some distances. It does all of this stuff without an active
internet connection because &lt;strong&gt;GPS DOES NOT NEED INTERNET.&lt;/strong&gt; It drives me crazy
that Google Maps won’t download the area that I live in (which they might know
because I occasionally &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to turn on Location Services on my phone) or any
location that I tell it to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From their POV, it’s probably not the best because most of the traffic related
data on Google Maps is crowd sourced and you ain’t getting no data from a phone
that is offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to leap frog that and build a &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; app that would show you
your current LAT-LONG, store a list of some LAT-LONGs and then show you
distances to whichever places among those that you ask for. I decided to build
this in react because getting the current location in react is simple. REALLY
SIMPLE: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) =&amp;gt; { ... },
(errCB)&lt;/code&gt;. I am sure I would have lost about 3 hours downloading and getting
gradle to build a hello world on my Linux machine! &lt;em&gt;THAT&lt;/em&gt; friction right at the
beginning of the road is really irritating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But choosing React was not the ideal thing to do. I had heard enough about Redux
to know that it was a good thing that came in handy almost always. A global
state, you can add actions, your reducer will take care of it, etc. IT was all
very hi-fi and I believed (rather stupidly, I admit) that I won’t need any of
that and that I could get away with it this time by putting everything in a
single component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral:&lt;/strong&gt; I finally ended up &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; to send data / emit events in one
component and have the other component subscribe to them. I couldn’t find any
reliable event emitter for React Native, which is rather strange but
understandable. Consider too that I spent about 2 hours finding an appropriate
component to select multiple items in a list. I was unable to and had to settle
for a search and add one-by-one approach. Atleast, I was able to find the search
and filter plugin easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the app is in a limbo state where it doesn’t really work and won’t until I
either fix this issue or rebuild the whole thing in Redux. I am sure that
rethinking the whole idea of the app and it’s component structure in Redux will
take up more time than actually writing it down because very much like MVC,
Redux ends up structuring the app into independent self-sufficient components
that have no clue about what else is going on in the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One good thing that did come out of this excercise was my understanding of why
Redux is important and how it makes making even the simple apps &lt;em&gt;simpler&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; to design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I built the app in React Native actually, so all of the references to
React above are simply the “idea” of state and building the pure function
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt; that works against state. The code for the app isn’t open source yet,
I intend to make it available once it has reached a more complete state.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Old Habits Die Hard, Criminal show - GET IT</title>
   <link href="/2017/06/01/an-update"/>
   <updated>2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/06/01/an-update</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I find myself thinking about what to write every day. This has been happening
everyday since the end of the 100 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general update, is what this post is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10618.Apt_Pupil&quot;&gt;Apt
Pupil&lt;/a&gt;. The book has gone
literally nowhere since I started it. Since this is a book of four stories, I
don’t even know how much of it I have read, it must be 20-30 pages and the book
is slowly progressing somewhere. This initial period of intrigue that exists
right before the explosive event and the chase that happens in the end + climax
of the book seems to be a common theme in Stephen King books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also been raving about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thisiscriminal.com/&quot;&gt;Criminal show: a
podcast&lt;/a&gt; which I found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radiopublic.android&quot;&gt;Radio
Public&lt;/a&gt;.
The show is incredible! I have always liked short audio stuff like this, because
the recording is done in a studio and once the sound is mixed, the output is
incredibly personal. It feels like the person is talking to you through the
phone, on a really good connection. Episodes are also 20 minutes which is my
daily commute time! There is also something deeply interesting and intriguing
about the stories that they pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also discovering new content on Radio Public, there seem to be several good
shows. (99% Invisible is another good show. I am listening to episode &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;229: The
Trend Forecast&lt;/code&gt; right now!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit that I am relieved about &lt;em&gt;not having to&lt;/em&gt; write every day!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 100 - Shawshank Redemption + The Last Post in this series</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/28/day-100"/>
   <updated>2017-05-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/28/day-100</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;HELL YEAH, WE ARE FINALLY HERE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Prologue: This is going to be a normal Ep 100 post. My thoughts about this
series, the things I wrote about (and didn’t), the days I really did write well
etc will all be covered in a different post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-100-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rita-hayworth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is Rita Hayworth. She was the one that Andy Dufresne began with. For 27
years he toiled, and made it out. It’s an amazing novella! I kind-of knew the
ending but was blocking it off so I could still enjoy the book. The revelation
is not the climax and I think that’s where the story really excels. In telling
the story of two men, vastly different from each other, but stuck in an
unfavourable situation and still trying to make their way through life despite
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also covers all the problems with the prison system, how it is designed and
what happens to incarcerated men after they are left outside, in the world. This
is a recurring theme that I have read about in a few books now. I remember
George Orwell’s short story about a travelling nomad living and sleeping in
different beds each week. I remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1822935708?book_show_action=false&amp;amp;from_review_page=1&quot;&gt;Down and Out in Paris and
London&lt;/a&gt;, again by
Orwell, which talks an insane amount about how the poorest people lived in the
20th century, a bare 70-80 years ago. This is even slightly touched on in
Malcolm X’s autobiography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2013088219?type=review#rating_119043364&quot;&gt;my goodreads
review&lt;/a&gt;
of the book. It’s rather short at about 140-150 pages and I was able to finish
it off during a hectic week by just reading everything on my phone and not
waiting to settle down and read. I think that’s the only way I can keep up with
reading and also manage work and life despite it. I &lt;em&gt;absolutely must&lt;/em&gt; use every
single moment of my waking time. It’s cumbersome to do that, but &lt;em&gt;Onward and
Upward, that’s the only way I can go now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now have two completely new albums that I have discovered (led to, rather) and
like. The first one is &lt;strong&gt;Silverstein’s This is How the Wind Shifts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gTB4bifBpgI?list=PLKAm0swRNcks78_pzDRDMmp4R4wxGwQE2&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one is the album containing my recent favourite. &lt;strong&gt;Incubus’s If Not
Now, When?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aUrcKDqjYDY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read Incubus’ wikipedia page, and I was really surprised to find out that the
band was formed in 1991 when they were in high school! The 90s were indeed a
different place. I wonder how the high school bands of today are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am back to listening to Humbug now, in fact Cornerstone is playing the
background as I write down the last few words of this 100 day post series. It’s
a bitter sweet moment. I am relieved to have finished off a challenge that I
took on on a whim and didn’t give much consideration to. I slightly panicked
when I realised what I had committed to and wanted to get out. I settled down
after about 3 weeks and wrote about whatever I could find. I struggled for
content and had to make do with mediocre posts. And through all that, I still
wrote a 100 blog posts in 100 days. This is &lt;strong&gt;BIG&lt;/strong&gt; for me!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;util&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;inspect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;depth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code gives the following output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; other: 
   &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; __v: 0,
       username: &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;u0.16941186863323354&apos;&lt;/span&gt;,
       name: &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;User 8&apos;&lt;/span&gt;,
       _id: 5929cc51d66b3e0a4c4796f0 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,
     1 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;,
  normal: 
   &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; __v: 0,
     username: &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;u40.00008901152893536768&apos;&lt;/span&gt;,
     name: &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;User 10&apos;&lt;/span&gt;,
     _id: 5929cc51d66b3e0a4c4796f1 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have not noticed the inconsistency yet, see the results again. Two
apparently same blocks of code seem to be doing something completely different.
One returns an object while the other returns an array containing an object and
an integer. (On further investigation, I found out that the number is the number
of people that were created. If you do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p1.save(...)&lt;/code&gt; and then again
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p1.save(...)&lt;/code&gt;, the count turns out to be 0)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, other is the new function notation that has been activated in ES 2015. I
have read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions&quot;&gt;syntax
documentation&lt;/a&gt;
for this and nothing seems amiss here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying this out without async, using code that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Mongoose connection, Person schema, Person model declaration etc&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;genPerson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;genPerson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;created&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside of this, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;created&lt;/code&gt; is the object that was created an &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; the array
that is returned in the previous code’s other case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very intriguing issue that has now been put out there in the public for people
to find and explain. This undoubtedly restricts the usage of the arrow syntax
with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; unless you would like to have random &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[0]&lt;/code&gt;s everywhere in your
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;results.objName[0]&lt;/code&gt; references.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 98 - Rains a bit, Floods a lot in Koramangala</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/26/day-98"/>
   <updated>2017-05-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/26/day-98</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;08:00 pm: Walk into a restaurant for dinner with a few friends and seniors from IIT
KGP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:30 pm: Decide to step outside and be faced with one feet of water in every
direction the eye can see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaction: WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED HERE?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best reference to come up with here is: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra_floods_of_2005&quot;&gt;July 26, 2005,
Bombay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was there, 9 years old at the time. Hardly understanding what the fuss was
about, schools weren’t there for a few days I was definitely real happy about
&lt;em&gt;THAT&lt;/em&gt;. There was a lot of stuff going on at that time in the city, I got to
know of most of them after the fact. As stories that were recounted several
times whenever the topic of flooding came back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I am reading the wikipedia page, I am extremely surprised to see that there
were PAPERS written on the topic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Andharia (2006) contrasts the “widespread acts of generosity and altruism” in
Mumbai with the general social disorder that was seen in the aftermath of
Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well well well. I don’t want to read that paper because it is probably
blabbering on and on about &lt;em&gt;Indian culture and tradition&lt;/em&gt; and the helping
tendency of Mumbaikars etc. There’s nothing worth being in a paper there. And
especially, comparing to something like a Hurricane in the US which was properly
managed is unfair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12 years on, I waded through knee deep water for about 700 m before we were on
High ground again and able to reach home safely.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 97 - The Circle - complete review</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/25/day-97"/>
   <updated>2017-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/25/day-97</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I watched The Circle. &lt;strong&gt;It’s a movie everyone &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to watch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie touches on some of the core concepts of privacy and does a really
really good job of putting a clear LINE where transparency begins and
privacy ends. They do it in an obscure fashion with no direct references, main
characters who are incredibly skewed in their personalities, visions and with
motives unknown to the audience. Money might be a driving factor, but Tom
Hanks’ character and the guy Tom Stenton, they have LOTS of data, I wonder if
money is their only over reaching goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, putting all of that aside, it’s a great cautionary tale of what happens
when people start believing that what’s not on the internet and events whose
memories are only held in a person or a few people’s memories might as well have
never happened because there is no record of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SATIRE!&lt;/strong&gt; I want to call this movie a satire, but the typical absurdity of
satire and the explicit references to things that are outlandish and obviously
impossible is lacking. The ending is very dystopian and 1984. (I wonder if the
writer / director were influenced by that book. The movie ends with people &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
having telescreens forced on them, but &lt;em&gt;voluntarily&lt;/em&gt; putting cameras in front of
them for the whole day. They are &lt;em&gt;allotted&lt;/em&gt; time for bathroom breaks of 3
minutes. “Bathroom lighting is the best lighting a selfie can ever have” - A
wise woman once discovered.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 60 minutes of the movie, the tide was slowly turning and all the ominous
events of the second half of the movie were on the horizon. As the movie stopped
for the interval, and the lights came on, one man summed up this movie in a
couple words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scary-huh&quot;&gt;Scary, huh?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of Mae Holland is where most people are at right now. Not too
famous, overwhelmed at how many people are interested in their daily activities
which to them have been routine and mundane forever, not too worried about who
is watching what, not realising that they have lost privacy simply because they
have location turned on on their phone, or post geotagged photos to facebook or
twitter unknowingly. (Twitter used to strip away all location information from
photographs, I saw a TED Talk about this once. I don’t know if their policies
have changed now though, I hope they still strip information by default and make
sharing location a little bit harder so people explicitly have to do it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this said, the ending is a bit confused. She says “Secrets are lies” in
the beginning of the movie, she releases all of her bosses’ emails, everything
is out there in the open. But the ending shows her waking up, saying good
morning to the camera and then zooms out to show a collage of millions of other
camera frames that look very similar. They outed the bosses, but they still
couldn’t stop the loss of privacy? I don’t get it. I will definitely watch the
stream the movie and watch it again, maybe things will be clearer then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A special mention for Karen Gillan’s performance of Annie’s character! The
make-up, her disheveled hair during the middle part of the movie, the wrinkles
under her eyes and her final “going-back-to-normal” once she goes back home is a
treat to watch on screen!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 96 - Shawshank Redemption - getting to the end</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/24/day-96"/>
   <updated>2017-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The second type of guy knows that there is no harm in hoping for the best as
long as you are prepared for the worst&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(p. 88, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption – Stephen King)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have known this particular phrase / quote for a long time now. I finally found
the source (or it could be older than even this book!) In any case, it is a
&lt;em&gt;GREAT&lt;/em&gt; quote to live by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(27th May, 2017) I have now read about 100-110 pages of the book. Dufresne has
made the escape, Red is merely tying up all the knots. I have read the whole
book (almost) on my phone, and I didn’t check where the book ends. So I am going
by the rough metric that this book is about 180 pages long, I could be horribly
wrong. I would prefer for the book to be shorter. Not because the book is bad
(IT’S NOT!) but because a book ending before you expected it to is rather
convenient! (considering that I am two books behind schedule, I would like to
keep it that way atleast and not fall back even further!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book has been &lt;strong&gt;surprisingly graphic&lt;/strong&gt; and I am glad I didn’t watch the
movie. I will probably not watch the movie even after because I know the story
and only the gory details of him coming into the prison, the sisters etc will be
new to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(24th May, 2017) I am booked for a showing of The Circle tomorrow night. It has
been rather shady movie till now. Except for the fact that Emma Watson joins a
company led by Tom Hanks and that the company is doing something with incredibly
small cameras and a speech that ends with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Knowing is good, but knowing everything is better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know nothing about the premise. &lt;em&gt;Alien: Covenant&lt;/em&gt; was the exact same thing to
me, I hadn’t even read the plot synopsis anywhere before going to the movie
because I thought it would give away too much. I have watched The Circle’s
trailer and it’s suspiciously less tech and more gimicks and punch lines.
Companies that do that are generally upto no good. Detailed review of The Circle
coming up tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 95 - BEGIN Shawshank Redemption, another query population hurdle</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/23/day-95"/>
   <updated>2017-05-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UNFULFILLED POTENTIAL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have seen any trailer of The Circle (2017), you will know that this is
the thing that Emma Watson’s character is most scared of. I just finished
watching Good Will (Goodwill?) Hunting. That movie is the portrayal of
unfulfilled potential. The ending is good, in my opinion though, the movie
is over rated generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have gone through 2 pages of Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It’s
pretty easy reading (after that nightmarish historical mystery book, I bet
anything with actual people walking around the place would be easy reading) and
I know who Andy Dufresne is. Fair enough, more updates soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back and had a look at the “Should we send a notification?” flow chart
that was recently tweeted by someone at Slack. It was a quip at how people say
that “They could build X on a weekend”, X being anything like Facebook, Twitter,
Slack etc. i.e. &lt;strong&gt;Deceptively simple products that have had a lot of thought put
into their design, but no one acknowledges them. Worst of all, even other
engineers don’t.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When Hacker News commenters say &amp;quot;I could build that app in a weekend!&amp;quot; I think of this chart of how Slack decides to send a notification. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LopicAyzkL&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/LopicAyzkL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Matt Haughey (@mathowie) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mathowie/status/837735473745289218&quot;&gt;March 3, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another query population hurdle that I ran into was the population of an array
of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s, which are a unique field in another collection. Let me explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Person: {
  username: {
    type: String,
    unique: true,
    required: true
  }
}

Comment: { ...
  usernames: {
    type: [String]
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have read the mongoose query population document several times but this
particular case it seems hasn’t been addressed. If it were an array of
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ObjectId&lt;/code&gt;s, of course it would be a simple &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;populate(&apos;usernames&apos;)&lt;/code&gt; addition to
the query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtuals was something that I tried to look into but that again serves another
purpose altogether. I will keep looking but I think mongoose doesn’t support
something like this right now.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 94 - Starting Shawshank Redemption + Good Will Hunting</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/22/day-94"/>
   <updated>2017-05-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/22/day-94</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Next up: Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. I read my
Stephen King book a few months back, and I promised to read more Stephen King
this year. Different Seasons (the set of 4 novellas) is the perfect way to get
started. All the four novellas are small enough for me to be able to be
confident enough that I will finish each soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It’s also a convenient way to cheat through the Goodreads reading challenge and
mark 1 HUGE book as four books. I don’t know of any other Stephen King book that
would afford &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; particular oppurtunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Will Hunting is the next movie I would like to tackle, I didn’t finish
watching it just yet. It has been a great movie till now, especially Skylar’s
character and the actress playing her. With her British accent, and her studying
to be a doctor, Matt Damon is simply chicken-ing out of the relationship that
could probably mean a lot more, if he would just try. I hope they get together
by the end of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also see that Mike Ross’ character in Suits is heavily inspired from Will
Hunting. Both of them had a rocky childhood, can immediately assimilate a lot of
pages of material and understand it. One line that Mike Ross had in Suits rather
early in the season when everyone was so awed with his ability to remember
everything that he saw once: “Once I see something, I understand it. Once I
understand it, I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; forget it.” It is a shame that show went to the dumps
just 6 seasons later. Come to think of it, after the initial awestrucked-ness of
everyone with Mike’s abilities and Harvey’s swag (for lack of a better word?),
there was nothing propelling the story forward except for some petty (in
retrospect) office politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Mike’s secret is revealed to the world, there is absolutely nothing to go
forward with. They should have ended the series with him going to jail. A lot of
other people agree with my assessment of this series. Have a look at the
viewership graphs on Wikipedia for Suits through the seasons. The drop from
season 1 and even season 2 and 3 is &lt;strong&gt;noticeable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 93 - Watching Alien Covenant + Strolling on M.G Road</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/21/day-93"/>
   <updated>2017-05-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/21/day-93</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finished reading Daughter of Time today! -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2000422889&quot;&gt;Goodreads
review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today will be one of the few days that I have been able to post well before
midnight AND on the same day as the post is due to be out. I think as this
endeavour comes to an end, I would like to be able to make the last 7 posts on
time. Ending on a high, is what it is called, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched Alien: Covenant today. It was so totally on a whim. It’s a &lt;strong&gt;GREAT&lt;/strong&gt;
movie though. Saying anything more about it will almost certainly spoil the plot
for the &lt;em&gt;reading-between-the-lines&lt;/em&gt; sort of readers of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Fassbender does an amazing job playing a robot (“synthetic human
being”). One question that comes to mind is whether an actor who can play a
synthetic with apparently no emotions is a &lt;em&gt;GREAT&lt;/em&gt; actor or a &lt;em&gt;really bad&lt;/em&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One line in the movie that can be divulged without spoiling the movie, as long
as no context is provided is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;serve-in-heaven-or-reign-in-hell&quot;&gt;serve in heaven or reign in hell?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is perhaps obvious from my writing that line in a heading block, I absolutely
loved this line. I am sure this wasn’t the first time that this line has come
up. But it really struck me when it was delivered. There are a lot of archaic
references, both to literature and music, in this movie. There is something
about robots and archaic references, I have seen them often now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shutter Island remains unwatched. Surprisingly, I fell asleep EXACTLY at the
same point I fell asleep when I was first watching the movie. I distinctly
remember the scene as being the one in which the two detectives were orderly’s
clothes and walk into Ward C and there’s this water dripping or something as
they walk through a hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That scene is so unsufferably devoid of mystery and despite that, it’s a SLOW
SLOW scene where things don’t come to a crescendo soon enough. I wonder what
people who &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the movie think about the scene. The beginning of the movie,
till that scene, has been ominous and something seems off. (Especially about the
orderly who puts Leo to bed after he has the weird so-called “migraine”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I intend to find a new book to read.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 92 - Shutter Island Rewatch + Departures - Silverstein</title>

   <id>/2017/05/20/day-92</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shutter Island vs. Inception. I immediately picked Shutter Island, ironically, I
know Inception’s story and even the little subtleties of the screenplay,
storytelling, dialogues, the flights, the characters, the levels etc etc way
better than Shutter Island which I watched only once. I decided to fix that and
watch the whole movie again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://in.bookmyshow.com/bengaluru/movies/the-circle/ET00050335&quot;&gt;The Circle&lt;/a&gt;
is out. I wanted to read that book before the movie came out and then I could go
to the movies and watch the movie and decide what I liked better: A few hundred
pages or Emma Watson and Tom Hanks. I decided to do that one year ago with Great
Expectations (Dickens) and Fitoor. I managed to finish the book and watch the
movie in one of the last days that it was in the theatres in Calcutta. This
year, it was not to be. One of the Gillian Flynn novels is coming out as a TV
series soon, &lt;em&gt;THAT&lt;/em&gt; should be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found one more song that I can obsessively listen to. &lt;strong&gt;Departures
(acoustic) by Silverstein.&lt;/strong&gt;  I have nothing against the rock version of this
song, which has a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit of growling and lots of electric guitar. It’s
just that I like the acoustic version better because of how it manages to convey
the mood of the songwriter despite being so obviously deprived of instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to go back to watching the movie and then reading Daughter of Time
(maybe) and hopefully, finishing it this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this is today’s post, being posted today. I am finally back on track, with
7 more posts to go. The time from 18th February to now has gone by rather fast,
it’s been 3 months and 2 days since I started this challenge!!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 91 - Daughter of Time disoriented me, so a Glossary</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/19/day-91"/>
   <updated>2017-05-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/19/day-91</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Daughter of Time is a &lt;em&gt;slight&lt;/em&gt; disorienting book. It is about a historical
murder (or not?) and dates back four centuries. The names are all extremely
confusing (of the characters in the book that the main character is reading).
For now, Alan, the Matron, the two nurses, Marta, Brent and Laura seem to be the
only ones in the main story that matter. There’s also a Sergeant, and a Super
who never enters the picture (Thankfully!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the historical side though, things are murky as hell. Richard III is the
character of interest, he has an elder brother by ten years Edward. I don’t know
what number this Edward was though, IV seems like a good guess. He also had
another elder brother called George whose children were not given the throne
because someone said that they were illegitimate. Richard had a wife who was one
of his neices. A sister to the two litte boys who have apparently been murdered
by Richard III.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other characters that have made an appearance till now are Cecily Nevill,
Richard and Edward’s mom. A Woodvill woman who was Edward’s wife and all of her
relatives who are all upstarts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also know that the circumstances surrounding Edward’s death and Richard’s
actions right after his death were all textbook good younger brother and there
was no reason to believe that he had any motive to murder his dead brother’s
only two sons just then. They investigation is still on (and will remain so for
about 47% of the remaining part of the book).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if anyone uses Foursquare anymore. Back when I installed it, it was a
really good looking app. Now, it’s a normal looking app but it took me to a
great Chinese restaurant somewhere in the middle of Koramangala yesterday.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/hunan/4e7b4e08887750b4e4a8708d&quot;&gt;Hunan&lt;/a&gt;, it was called.

   <title>Day 90 - Goodbye Capture Groups, Hello Word Boundaries</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/18/day-90"/>
   <updated>2017-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/18/day-90</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was an interesting Regex problem to solve today. Insert commas in a number
according to the Indian numbering system. There’s an inherent asymmetry in the
Indian system&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number: 1 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian: Rs. 10,00,000
American: Rs. 1,000,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first approach that I took was to use capture groups. Capture the last three
digits, put a comma in front of them, then the next two and so on. This would
have worked if all the numbers that this replacement needed to happen on were of
the same number of digits. That kind of thing never happens in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scouring the internet, I eventually landed on the Regex used to insert commas
according to the American system. The regex looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;str.replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, &quot;,&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know a fair amount of Regex from having used &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; inside and outside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;
regularly to replace text. This regex had a lot of things that I didn’t
recognize. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\B&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;?=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;?!&lt;/code&gt; and also some parentheses which weren’t working as
group capturers and a comma appearing in the middle of two characters. I had
never seen that before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regular-expressions.info&quot;&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt; which has
incredibly detailed articles about all the operators that Regex supports and the
things that can be accomplished with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with the knowledge of what “Not a word boundary \B” and Lookahead
assertion using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;?=&lt;/code&gt; means, I delved into finding a Regex that would solve the
problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution turned out to be a two step:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;str.replace(/\B(?=\d{3}$)/g, &quot;,&quot;)
   .replace(/\B(?=(\d{2})+(?!\d),)/g, &quot;,&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one &lt;em&gt;finds the first &lt;strong&gt;NOT a word boundary&lt;/strong&gt; which is succeeded by 3
digits and the end of the string&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second regex looks for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOt a word boundaries&lt;/strong&gt; that have exactly two
digits after them and stop matching when a comma is encountered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this magic (not really.) is possible because Lookahead assertions don’t
&lt;em&gt;consume characters&lt;/em&gt;. Consuming characters basically means that the regex
pointer moves forward from one character to the other after looking at it.
Lookahead assertions keep the pointer at the character being considered for a
match and simply lookahead and assert or &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; assert the stuff they have been
asked to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to have a look at how this is implemented in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; or
even &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; for Node, but I am unreasonably sure I wouldn’t understand the
implementation. This “looking at the implementation and not understanding it”
will become a post inspiration in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; All the code above is JavaScript, duh.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 89 - 4 chapters into Daughter of Time. Where is this book going?</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/17/day-89"/>
   <updated>2017-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/17/day-89</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have read four chapters of Daughter of Time now. It is going good till now, I
have absolutely no clue about the history or England. A cursory reading of the
Wikipedia pages of House York and Richard III himself, took care of that
(partially). The story itself is going to probably revolve around Richard III,
his brother Edward, the two nephews, Tyrell and two of his hench men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way everyone has a new story or a new view point to add to the story of
Richard III is totally in line with how History is as one chooses to see it. As
a friend of mine put it one fine evening, over dinner, “All objectivity is lost
when you are reading history. It is not just facts, dates, causes and effects
anymore. It’s much more than that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why everyone keeps coming to visit Alan Grant is not broached in the book at
all. This is the fifth book in the series, and I feel like there are some
presumptions that were made about the reader’s knowledge of Alan’s temperament.
How he was good with faces, or only people interested him and not
generalisations. The author doesn’t spend too much time on these points and
simply brushes past them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final note: The endgame of this book isn’t clear to me. It’s a mystery, one
that (probably?) can’t be &lt;em&gt;solved&lt;/em&gt; in the old fashioned sense of the word. There
can be theories and facts that refute those theories, or there can be theories
that don’t have any facts refuting them, but none proving that &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; was
indeed what happened. So, where is this book going? That’s an exciting situation
to be in. To not know where a book’s plot is headed. A refreshing change!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Digital Ocean script is almost done now, it can create a snapshot. Deleting
the older snapshot though just became a bit more trickier. As it happens, the
time taken to create a snapshot is ~20-25 minutes. I never measured it, but it
takes a &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt; amount of time. So, to delete the older snapshot &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt;
the newer snapshot has been succesfully created, we would need another cron job,
running at a higher frequency that polls for multiple automatically created
droplets and deletes the older one if found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this so that billing can be kept at a minimum. I am writing the scripts
in Ruby, the second script should be easy enough. I have decided on a pattern
for naming the automatically created droplets, so as to not accidentally delete
intentionally stored droplets at any point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 88 - Query population with refPath works. What went wrong?</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/16/day-88"/>
   <updated>2017-05-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/16/day-88</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been delving into Mongoose and Lodash rather heavily in the past few
days. A strange thing that I found with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html&quot;&gt;Mongoose Query
Population&lt;/a&gt; was that the dynamic
referencing of the model to populate from, to be done using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;refPath&lt;/code&gt; in the
Schema, didn’t work for multiple documents. (or so I thought! Read on.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same thing worked for a single document. I decided to conduct an isolated
test to check if this was a problem, or if we were simply using it wrong. The
test worked well, it isn’t a problem with mongoose. (I am still no closer to
figuring out what the anomaly in the original use-case was)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the javascript for the example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;let db_conn_string = &quot;mongodb://&amp;lt;host&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;port&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;db&amp;gt;&quot;;
let options = { user: &quot;&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;&quot;, pass: &quot;&amp;lt;password&quot; };

let mongoose = require(&apos;mongoose&apos;);
mongoose.connect(db_conn_string, options);

console.log(&quot;Connected to mongoose&quot;);

let util = require(&apos;util&apos;);
let async = require(&apos;async&apos;);
let Schema = mongoose.Schema;
let ObjectId = Schema.ObjectId;

var PersonSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String
  },
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true
  }
});

var Person = mongoose.model(&apos;Person&apos;, PersonSchema);

var p1 = new Person({ ... });
var p2 = new Person({ ... });
var p3 = new Person({ ... });

var people = [p1, p2, p3];

p1.save((err) =&amp;gt; { ... });
p1.save((err) =&amp;gt; { ... });
p1.save((err) =&amp;gt; { ... });

var ChatMessageSchema = new Schema({
  message: {
    type: String
  },
  author: {
    type: ObjectId,
    ref: &apos;Person&apos;
  }
});

var ChatMessage = mongoose.model(&apos;ChatMessage&apos;, ChatMessageSchema);

var c1 = new ChatMessage({ ... });
var c2 = new ChatMessage({ ... });
var c3 = new ChatMessage({ ... });
var c4 = new ChatMessage({ ... });

var ReportAbuseSchema = new Schema({
  message: {
    type: String
  },
  resource: {
    type: ObjectId,
    refPath: &apos;entity&apos;
  },
  entity: {
    type: String // Can be either Person or ChatMessage
  }
});

var ReportAbuse = mongoose.model(&apos;ReportAbuse&apos;, ReportAbuseSchema);

var r1 = new ReportAbuse({ 
                            message: &quot;report a chat&quot;, 
                            resource: &quot;5798...&quot;, // This is a comment ID
                            entity: &quot;ChatMessage&quot; 
                        });

var r2 = new ReportAbuse({ 
                            message: &quot;report a person&quot;, 
                            resource: &quot;5905...&quot;, // This is a PERSON ID
                            entity: &quot;Person&quot; 
                        });

records = [c1, c2, c3, c4, r1, r2];

let iterator = function (record, callback) {
  record.save(function (error) {
    if (error) {
      console.error(error.stack);
      process.exit();
    } else {
      console.log(&quot;Saved record!&quot;);
      callback();
    }
  });
};

async.each(records, iterator, function (error) {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error.stack);
  } else {
    console.log(&quot;SUCCESS!&quot;);
  }
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran the script once. Opened the DB and copied over the user IDs to put them in
the comment and reportAbuse record creations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above code didn’t work as is. There was an extremely weird &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$author_1 dup
error&lt;/code&gt;. Now that I look at the code again, I wonder if it is because there are a
few parallel &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;save&lt;/code&gt; operations happening on the Database. I can’t be sure just
yet, more updates to follow in the next few days. (I think)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran it just by creating one comment, one person and 2 report abuses. And then
querying all the report abuses and asking mongoose to populate &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;resource&lt;/code&gt;. It
worked as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;let query = ReportAbuse.find().populate(&quot;resource&quot;).lean().exec(...)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Day 87 - Metakgp Wiki goes down and comes back up; Script to snapshot each week</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Next up: Daughter of Time by Josephine Tey. I was going to read Dennis Lehane’s
Mystic River (because Donna Tartt said that that was the book that pushed her to
write Secret History), but it was about 350 or 450 pages or something, and I
wanted to stick to smaller books which I can be reasonably sure I would complete
than involve myself in a huge book which I would be rather skeptical about
completing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting for Daughter of Time is peculiar, apparently, it’s an analysis /
investigation of a painting and a murder by an investigator on his hospital bed
for 2 days (or more? The whole book, basically). I am a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; nervous about
whether I would like this book or not, the lethargy that is conveyed in the plot
synopsis is part of the reason why. I am taking the plunge, nonetheless. (That
book also featured in a major daily’s Top 100 Crime Novels list)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.metakgp.org&quot;&gt;Metakgp’s Wiki&lt;/a&gt; went down some time around 2017-05-15
0930 +5.5. It was down for about 40 hours before being bought back up with a
recovery read-only server and appropriate changes to the DNS records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was because of a kernel panic, it seems for now. We are tracking the incident
on a issue at Github: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/metakgp/metakgp/issues/17&quot;&gt;metakgp/metakgp
#17&lt;/a&gt;. One thing I was surprised
with was the speed with which the update in the DNS records started showing up
on my browser. (It was immediate) I wonder if that was because Cloudfare was
doing some kind of magic with DNS propagation or because the browser got the
correct DNS instead of the cached ones because of the earlier 500 responses from
the cached one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/metakgp/metakgp/issues/18&quot;&gt;metakgp/metakgp #18: Snapshot the wiki droplet every
week&lt;/a&gt;. The Digital Ocean API is
rather powerful, and I have heard a lot about how people use it to add and
remove droplets from their fleet depending on the load to their application.
This particular functionality should be possible with a POST request and a DELETE
requese. I am guessing that from the REST API assurance that DO seems to imply,
I think it should be easy enough to write the script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started writing it in Ruby and some part of it is done, I should be able
to finish it off and deploy it this week. I have found that small tasks like
these have an exponentially decreasing graph where the y axis is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Enthusiasm to
finish the task&lt;/code&gt; and the x axis is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Time after ideation&lt;/code&gt;. Right now, the the
x-axis is at 14 hours and my enthusiasm is above the threshold. We will see what
becomes of that tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 86 - Cruising Attitude - A list of the things I learnt about flight atttendants and flying</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/14/day-86"/>
   <updated>2017-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/14/day-86</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finished reading Cruising Attitude today! It was a really easy read, with lots
of light hearted humor and some really gruesome experiences, both of the author
herslef and her friends, who play a major role throughout the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things about the flight attendant profession that I learnt
from the book, I can’t make an accurate, exhaustive list of them, but I will try
to make some list that I can refer back to, later:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They get paid far less than everyone thinks they do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They have to bring their own food from home because the snacks on a flight are
  not for them and they can eat first class food, ONLY if it is left over and
  if the pilots don’t want it (some crews might not even offer the pilots
  food!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A turn-around is a trip in which you go from one place to another and return
  on the same day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They try to save money everywhere, including the places they stay at while
  they are in a city&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seniority decides what trips you get to make, and what places you get to
  server within the same flight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flight attendant training is a highly stressful few months in which they teach
  everyone everything that a flight attendant needs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FAA minimum crew is the minimum number of people that &lt;em&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; be present on a
  flight. ( ~ 1 attendant per 50 passengers)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Captains sit on the left side of the plane and they get paid a LOT more than
  First Officers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Captain and the first officer are served different food, in the off chance
  that the food was poisoned. The captain gets to decide what food he wants to
  give (from the offered ones) to the FO&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seniority is everything in the pilot world also. It decides if pilots have to
  fly before, on or after holidays, what kind of trips they have to make, what
  side of the plane they sit in and what food they get to eat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turbulence is of 4 categories: light, medium, extreme, severe. Turbulence is
  rarely rated as severe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;DO NOT&lt;/em&gt; press the call light unless it’s an emergency. Flight attendants
  appreciate if you flag them down while they pass by you or walk up to the
  galley to ask for coffee or the like&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each flight attendant is required to walk through the cabin once every 15
  minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food is almost always served from the front of the plane to the back, with
  some exceptions (which were later phased out? I am hazy here.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When flight attendants use their passes to travel, they are &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;non-revving&lt;/code&gt;
  (Non-Revenue Travel)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-revving attendants are always on standby until the last moment when that
  it becomes clear that a passenger is not going to be able to make it to the
  flight anymore&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As the plane lowers, air pressure increases and this pushes the ear drum
  inward. “Chewing gum helps, as does swallowing or yawning during descent”.
  Blocked Ears are a common reason due to which flight attendants are
  grounded. Continuing to fly with blocked ears, can cause severe damage. #&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Airplanes fishtail during turbulence, making the back of the plane much
  bumpier than the front. So, one good trick is to book a seat as close to the
  cockpit as possible.” – p.201&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On long flights, it is a good idea to take sleeping aides (like Ambien)
  &lt;em&gt;AFTER&lt;/em&gt; take-off. In the off chance that there’s a mechanical problem, and
  everyone has to move to another plane, doing that without Ambien is more
  conveient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through the whole list of my “Notes” section on my Kindle and it was
rather small, for a 260 page book. I didn’t highlight a lot in this book, I
wonder if that is because of the care-free, amateur writing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book provides a rather unique biographical perspective into the lives of
flight attendants and I definitely recommend it if you have a few spare hours.
Perhaps when you are passing through an airport? The setting would be near
perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 85 - Devastating global ransomware attack(??), Node.js event loop</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/13/day-85"/>
   <updated>2017-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/13/day-85</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A global ransomware attack and the oppurtunity to see it play out in real time?
Wow, that’s scary and exciting, no offence to everyone who was affected. It
sucks big time, but as someone who is fascinated by how these things start and
how they spread, it is particularly of interest to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exploit was a Windows port 445 SMB loophole that the NSA &lt;em&gt;apparently&lt;/em&gt; knew
about but disclosed to everyone only after their recent leak. Snowden quickly
took to twitter to criticise them for reducing the amount of time that everyone
had to prepare because they disclosed the exploit’s existence so late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way it spread (and the way people were affected) is of more interest to me,
because that is what everyone should be on the look out for and &lt;em&gt;not do&lt;/em&gt; when
the situation arises. Clicking on spam emails and attachments is a security
NO-NO that has been re-iterated ever since the existence of Spam emails. As one
article pointed out, “It was surprising that NHS computers got affected because
NHS employees are instructed not to open spam-looking emails.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some talk about how the worm mainly spread through networks inside
businesses where people might have been running outdated software for legacy
support reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aGhZQkoFbQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My internship at Elanic is mainly Node.js backend till now. This talk is a
&lt;em&gt;pretty good&lt;/em&gt; primer on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; Node.js really works. There are some old Ryan Dahl
talks about his philosophy when he was building Node.js and why he thought
non-blocking asynchronous I/O was the way to go for building web applications as
compared to the synchronous PHP way of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;db.query(...)&lt;/code&gt; that was popular in those
days. I found his talks to be a bit too dry, and being old, they were also not
in HD which made the metrics he was showing rather hard to make sense of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nginx apparently runs using an Event loop and uses only a single thread of
execution as compared to Apache’s one-thread-per-request model. While that
should ensure a significant increase in performance if one switches from Apache
to Nginx for a lot of concurrent users on a site, one of the major hurdles is
how hard it is to setup Nginx properly compared to the basic configuration of
Apache, which is literally just a couple of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apt-get install&lt;/code&gt; steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An nginx reverse proxy to setup Node.js applications seems to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-14-04#install-pm2&quot;&gt;weapon of
choice&lt;/a&gt;
for people wanting to setup ExpressJS REST APIs, but the scaling part of this
setup is something that needs to be managed manually and perhaps providers like
Heroku would do a better job at this. At $7 a month compared to Digital Ocean’s
slightly cheaper but vastly smaller $5 a month droplet, the difference in costs
is perhaps not too decisive at a small scale and would not justify the time that
would go into working on scaling servers, compared to developing things.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 84 - Handmaid's Tale Audiobook is here! (+ Claire Danes)</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/12/day-84"/>
   <updated>2017-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/12/day-84</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2017-05-13-audio-book.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just recieved the 2012 audiobook version of Handmaid’s Tale. &lt;strong&gt;AND I LOVE IT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried one audiobook before: The Hitchhiker’s guide to the Galaxy. I
didn’t like the book as much as everyone else told me they did. I don’t know if
it was the weird setting, or an immaturity on my part to appreciate fantasy-ish
literature. I know there’s a proper word for that, I can’t remember it now
though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started hearing the audiobook. They have done a good job of telling people
exactly how to move the files onto an iPod and I was able to do it in about 10
minutes with an old Windows 7 laptop. (In retrospect, with the Windows SMB
ransomware out there yesterday, this might have been a dodgy move. That
ransomware was delivered through spam emails though. The post mortem of that
attack will be interesting to read)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few chapters are very very shady about the plot of the novel, nothing
is given away, nothing is explained explicitly. If a reader were to read /
listen to the novel without having read the synopsis of the novel, then they
would hardly ever be able to &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt; what &lt;strong&gt;the Ceremony&lt;/strong&gt; entails for Offred,
the Commander and his wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember a lot of the first part of the book, &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the revelation about
how they got there. In retrospect, a few days after reading the book for the
first time, I can actually appreciate how insane it sounds that the Commander
and Offred &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; left their house and went to a shady night-club-ish place.
Things only escalate from there with the relationship between Offred and Nick,
in his room above the garage. That plot point sounds like something I imagined.
It’s that weird, when you consider the setup of the house, the country and the
government &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; learning about those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I am talking about Handmaid’s Tale being great in the &lt;strong&gt;84th&lt;/strong&gt; post of this
series.  &lt;em&gt;DO NOT&lt;/em&gt;, for one second, the irony and coincidence of that is lost on
me!)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 83 - StartPage search? P.S. I am sticking with Chrome</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Talking about the tweet that got popular, there was in particular one user,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/architex63&quot;&gt;@architex63&lt;/a&gt;, who had some radical opinions
about another well meaning person who suggested that you might want to use
StartPage Search if you want Google’s accuracy minus the Google’s tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; @marianstiehler @StartPageSearch @_icyflame @duckduckgo people
in the know, know.  I know a few of those people. I just try to warn people. can&amp;#39;t really say
why. do some research. good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Beeve Stannon (@architex63) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/architex63/status/862700408598388736&quot;&gt;May 11, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried using &lt;a href=&quot;https://classic.startpage.com/&quot;&gt;classic.startpage.com&lt;/a&gt; and while
the search results were accurate, the first three results were injected ads!
They look exactly like the results and weren’t blocked by ublock. While ads are
slightly annoying in general, and extremely annoying when they appear as the
first thing that can be clicked in the results of a search, I might put up with
them if I could be assured about the security of the search engine itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DDG was suggested by Snowden himself, and I tend to trust the guy who risked his
life and did incredibly dangerous stuff against arguably the most powerful
government just to prove a point to a large amount of people. StartPage search
hasn’t had that kind of acceptance just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chrome seemed to be the common gripe among people, but frankly, I don’t see the
angst against that. Brave for Android is a &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt; browser and it’s the best
for Android with in built ad blocking and HTTPS everywhere. For linux though,
Chrome is the best that’s out there now. I have used Chromium, &lt;a href=&quot;https://icyflame.github.io/blog/linux/2015/10/03/chromium-vs-firefox/&quot;&gt;raved about the
low RAM usage of
Firefox&lt;/a&gt;,
and even tried out there ones like Opera and Vivaldi, both of which kept hanging
on me and just &lt;em&gt;didn’t work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not going to switch back to anything other than Chrome for a while now, I
can’t see what I could switch to. Chromium’s open source version might be an
option. For now though, Chrome + uBlock + Ghostery + DuckDuckGo is the best I am
going to commit to using daily.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 82 - A tweet that blew up</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/10/day-82"/>
   <updated>2017-05-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/10/day-82</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I tweeted something that quickly became my most liked and retweeted tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/862524711980285953&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2017-05-11-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, I went to the myactivity page because of a button on the DDG
search results page that pointed me to a DDG article about privacy measures to
take on PCs and Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone quickly pointed out, I didn’t have Google Analytics or other
analytics JavaScript running on the client side blocked. I used to use
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghostery.com/&quot;&gt;Ghostery&lt;/a&gt; for this. They gave a list of the tracking
services which are installed on the sites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An earlier version used to show a list of the trackers and it wouldn’t go away
immediately. I don’t think they even had the functionality to block scripts at
the very beginning. I didn’t try to remove that list, I admit. I simply
uninstalled the extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of trackers would appear on the bottom right corner, and would be there
for the first few seconds of visiting &lt;em&gt;each and every page&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I installed the latest version of Ghostery’s chrome extension and the list has
been replaced by a much less visible and less irritating “number” that they show
in the bottom right corner of every page after loading the page. Selecting the
“Block All” option (which honestly looked like the easiest thing to click on the
extension configuration page) blocks all scripts. I can see the scripts
complaining in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt; or Chrome itself notifying the console that
scripts were blocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also some more interesting conversations on the tweet. I have to
cover them in the next post. &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; xD.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In perhaps the largest backlog of mine in this series of posts, I am now four
posts behind. This post should have been out on 9th May, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; run a test about how many times I spoke about this series in a post. I
think it must be every other post. I am not even kidding. I am also at a
position where I mut write the posts for the next 4 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have moved slightly forward in Heather Poole’s book. Her mother becomes an air
hostess and starts working alongside her! That is probably one of the weirder
plot points in the book. The back stories and the way her roommates live their
lives is rather interesting. I am glad she spent as much time as she did on
describing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paula Hawkins released a new book called Into the Water. Megan Miranda is on
tour for promoting her new book Perfect Stranger. The female psycho-thriller
fiction market seems to be on the up ever since the stellar Gone Girl and
the equally good book but slightly less hot adaptation The Girl On the Train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am hoping for an imaginative plot with some crazy (and believable) twists.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 80 - Homeland season 1 - episodes 1 to 8 - a COMPLETE RE-WATCH</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/08/day-80"/>
   <updated>2017-05-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/08/day-80</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I rewatched the first 8 episodes of Homeland season 1. The character development of
Carrie, Saul, Brody and David Estes (whom I totally ignored when I first watched
it) is mind blowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the relationship between Carrie and Brody. After their first
meeting, leaving each of them smiling and mystified by the other in the rain,
they go for the weekend to her cabin. Here, one of her dialogues makes you
really doubt if this time was &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; or she was still &lt;em&gt;just doing her job&lt;/em&gt;. My
guess is that, Carrie Mathison was confused. Carrie has always been bipolar,
this kind of thing would have been the perfect, subtle hint at how she would be
if she didn’t take her meds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there’s the reveal of Brody’s meeting with Walker’s rather sinister,
but generally harmless, diplomatic contact. Even though I am watching it for the
second time, I didn’t remember this scene and I was waiting with bated breath to
see who was in the chair as the diplomat walks into his house. It was still
exactly as jarring as watching it the first time, when Brody jumps out of the
chair and lunges for the guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to look at and wonder about, was Mandy Patinkin’s acting and his
character, Saul Berenson’s &lt;em&gt;STYLE&lt;/em&gt;. The one interrogation scene that he has with
Brody’s guard is enough to convince anyone of his prowess as an intelligence
officer. Carrie, through all the seasons, has always used her eyes, her
earnestness and oft-times her confused state of mind about whether or not she
loves an asset / source to get intel. Saul used a standard set of negotiation
tactics that he probably devised(?). The fact that the guard gives up the
information that gets the professor is enough proof for his effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and: Saul and Carrie. Saul has a &lt;strong&gt;major major&lt;/strong&gt; sweet spot for Carrie in the
first season. She goes around him and through him several times just in the
first 8 episodes. She begins with the bugging of Brody’s house, then she
oversteps her boundaries at the Brody debriefing, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; she goes and MEETS
Brody despite knowing that that is the worst thing she could have done and she
would irrevocably lose an unbiased boss after doing something like that. She
keeps doing it and Saul keeps believing and forgiving her, hoping for something
better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way they have come together again in Season 6 to work together has never
happenned before. This time, she abides by the rules (except in that small Sekou
Bah case where she overstepped, as usual), with Saul she is being a lot more
careful. The indications for this are non-existent and I think they just come
out of the writer’s psyche and don’t manifest themselves in season 6, but the
treatment is &lt;strong&gt;clear&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same set of writers has been writing and producing Homeland for the past 6
seasons, that has been one of the most important points in maintaining a
consistent character profile for each character. Especially characters as
complex as Carrie and Saul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. I spent (8 * 40) = 320 ~ 4.5-5 hours watching the 8 episodes. Atleast, I
could write this post. I am going to do just this from now to create content.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 79 - Cruising Attitude - Heather Poole</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/07/day-79"/>
   <updated>2017-05-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/07/day-79</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(May 9th, 2317 GMT+5.5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read Cruising Attitude today. I did that the whole day, I read about 53% of
it. It is a book by Heather Poole about her foray into the Airline industry and
talks about a lot of the intricacies of the flight attendant job, the training,
the appearance that is almost always impeccable, the language, their body
language, their walk through the terminal (!!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book featured in a recent NY Times article about what flight attendants
learn about at de-escalation training, and at 260 pages, it seemed like a really
good idea to start reading that book and finish it off as soon as I can. (I am
running 3 books behind schedule on my Goodreads Reading challenge. I don’t see
any holes in the next few months to be able to patch that up. PUSH NOW!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of it was really funny. It was also &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; coherent. It felt like
amateurish writing with phrases repeated within the space of a 2 pages, which is
more of an editing glitch, I think. But the fact that the writer is an amateur
is not lost on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has tried to tell a great story, which is commendable considering that it
might have been just as easy for her to just write a few chapters and make each
chapter about one particular incident and gloss over her own personal experience
as the first chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concentration on her friends and fellow flight attendants till now has been
indicative of the amount of sisterhood and comaradery that she feels about them.
Including those she was at flight attendant training (which she prefers to call
&lt;em&gt;Barbie Bootcamp&lt;/em&gt;) with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to be able to finish off this book in the near future and move on to more
ambitious reading projects. (This is certainly a day-off book with such easy
reading and a bare bones, easy to follow plot) I started this book with the hope
to really understand what flight attendants think and feel when they are on a
flight and in charge of about 50 passengers each. That goal &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; be
fulfilled by the end of this book, HEATHER POOLE, KUDOS!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 78 - Re-watching Homeland season 1; Claire Danes &lt;3</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/06/day-78"/>
   <updated>2017-05-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/06/day-78</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been rewatching Homeland episodes. Season 1, starting right from the
pilot. I can’t get enough of Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin before they became
infinitely more matured and started handling actual, credible threats instead of
gut feelings about someone who is off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-78-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;carrie&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-78-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;brody&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the last few moments of Homeland 1.4: Semper I. Carrie just met Brody
for the first time alone. Her smile says a lot here, she was struck by him right
from the first time they met. I never noticed the subtlety with which these
episodes were shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They way being a voyeur into Brody’s life made her feel bad, but she watched
anyway because she still believed that even in those moments he might give
something essential away. That quality stayed with her through 5 seasons. She
watches Quinn’s painful video several hundred times, until she finds the tile
design that eventually leads to them finding him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s surprisingly how less their character traits have all changed, having
a constant set of writers makes a huge difference in the continuity that a show
maintains. Changing writers will always change the style of a show, and viewers
&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; give up. Alex Gansa has done Homeland justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I think Homeland should end soon? Well, I don’t see any reason for them to
end it. The story hasn’t gotten repetitive yet, they are still coming up with
new plot points and insane insane twists that can’t be seen despite 5 seasons of
material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did Quinn have a good exit from the show? HELL YEAH. I am sure Rupert will be
back in past sequences in the next season, it’s a good old trick to keep the
transition from Rupert to no-Rupert smooth. I am glad for that, but his
character had become something that had only two goals, like one Reddit user
aptly summarised it. “He has to get together with Carrie now, or die. I don’t
see them killing him after this much groundwork that went into his character and
building him to this point.” That served as a source of hope and inspiration,
until the episode released. He had a good exit. Rupert Friend will return as
another different character somewhere else, I am sure. I shall wait eagerly for
that.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cruising Attitude (Heather Poole) is my next read. It’s about a flight
attendant’s view into making a flight work right. She had 15 years of experience
before she penned down this book. This book also featured in a recent NYTimes
article about conflict de-escalation, published in the aftermath of the
United Airlines fiasco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several TV series are now running at the same time. Handmaid’s Tale, Silicon
Valley Season 4, and Veep season 6. Lucifer’s Season 2 is resuming in two days!
Prison Break’s season 5 started a few weeks ago, in a surprising turn of events,
Michael turns out to be alive. Extremely strange! Sucre and T-Bag are still in
the story, that should be a good watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am listening now to Breaking Benjamin’s album Phobia now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TODO: YOUTUBE INSERT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent all my material on Day 78 (which should have been after this post, but
there was a slight ordering issue). It was about re-watching the first season of
Homeland. I decided that I had re-watched enough Seinfeld (I have now watched
almost every episode twice, and a few episodes upto 5-6 times, like The Stall,
the one in which they get stuck in the parking lot and the episode in which they
go to Hamptons to see the &lt;em&gt;ugly baby&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the latest (April, actually) news, there are &lt;em&gt;a few more&lt;/em&gt; book to screen
adaptations that are scheduled to come out this year. Gillian Flynn’s final
novel which hasn’t been adapted yet, Sharp Objects, is coming out as a series on
HBO starring AMY ADAMS! After Arrival, she &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; needs to step up her game
to play the frontwoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More Stephen King with It and Dark Tower. It is HUGE, it’s about 1000 pages and
I am not going to commit to that book anytime in the near future, which is
reason enough to be excited for the adaptation. I don’t know how long Dark Tower
is, but if it is anywhere more than 400 pages, I am going to skip it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Circle has been on my list for a while now, it should have been read before
Emma actually. It’s also a considerably long book, and I am not sure whether now
is the right time to start it. The adaptation is coming out very soon (or is
already out). I could rush to finish reading the book and then see the
adaptation in a theatre, the practicality of that plan isn’t something I can
attest to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murder on the Orient Express goes onto my list, I don’t like reading Agatha
Christie too much, but this one was really hyped up by everyone who read it. It
might be well worth the hype.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 74 - MISSED; DONE WITH EMMA (AUSTEN)! - Favourite Quotes (some)</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/02/day-74"/>
   <updated>2017-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/02/day-74</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is long overdue now. This post was supposed to be out two days ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-74-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took 1 month and 5 days to read that book! It was 450 pages. THAT IS
&lt;em&gt;UNACCEPTABLE&lt;/em&gt;. Softening my stane a little bit though, considering how much
stuff happened in the past two months (BTP Presentation, End term exams, looking
for an internship) it isn’t too bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book was GREAT. I get why Amy Dunne wanted everyone to read Austen. I am
going to wing it for this post and put in some of my favourite quotes from Emma.
This involves me (painfully) scrolling through my Kindle and reading the stuff I
have highlighted. Especially in Volume 3, when the story was drawing to a climax
there were a very high number of lines worth quoting right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only
half a mile from them, and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her
advantages, natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from
intellectual solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of
the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to
herself, or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect.
***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of
accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be sent
to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little education, without
any danger of coming back prodigies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is especially worth noticing. Austen goes out of her way to rub this
in.
***&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of
them. Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of
being silent. You must see the difference.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is representative of Emma’s outlook in the first volume of the book. She
was a first rate snob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you
all. In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits
her mother’s talents, and must have been under subjection to her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma is really attached to her father, and this is definitely the only
significant reference to her mother. This is in Volume 1 and after this, no
mention of her mother anywhere throughout the book! Not even in memories, or
otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men of
family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such
obscurity—and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace
they might be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be
revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry; I must
find other people charming— one other person at least. And I am not only, not
going to be married, at present, but have very little intention of ever
marrying at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall in love,
indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been in love; it is not
my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the defining Emma Volume 1 quote. It’s also extremely famous, and
is quoted everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy
contemptible to a generous public!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t outdated, I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other,
depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for his comforts,
that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his
neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any thing that
home affords.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also more hated John Knightley, her brother in law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;it will be a small party, but where small parties are select, they are perhaps
the most agreeable of any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;half an hour’s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which
the daily happiness of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications
of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after undertaking this endeavour, I realised that it will take me an
unreasonable amount of time to go through all my quotes and mark the favourite
ones! &lt;a href=&quot;/public/pdf/Emma-Notebook.pdf&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is the PDF of my quotes,
generated by the Kindle. It has some profane language and all opinions that are
truly mine.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 73 - Day 1 in Bangalore; Anticipation</title>
   <link href="/2017/05/01/day-73"/>
   <updated>2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/05/01/day-73</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am now in Bangalore. An interesting fact: The past three days, at 4 pm, I was
in three different cities. 29th April: Kolkata, 30th April: Chennai and 1st May:
Bangalore. I bet this is how Perry Wright (from Big Little Lies) feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a line in that book that stuck with me. There are several quotes that I
still remember, because of the whole book + TV series thing, this one is
definitely my favourite. They are speaking about Perry in general, and Celeste
mentions how much he has to travel for work, and how he has to go around the
world. And the other character replies, &lt;em&gt;“Perry lives a rather exotic life,
huh”&lt;/em&gt;. Travel suggests an exotic tinge to life, and that’s the way it has been,
even though people who travel a lot for work are universally envied, their jobs
are universally less appealing to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very very happy turn of events is my progress with Emma! I am now done with
80% of the book! There’s still 90 pages of reading to be done, but I am feeling
a lot better now, I plan to quickly complete reading this book and turn on to
the next one. I have been stuck with this one book for long enough now. Not that
I am complaining, but the commitment of huge books is not something that I am
upto anymore. They take too long! (This was only 460 pages, compare that to the
5 ASOIAF giants at ~1000 pages each)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handmaid’s Tale is out now, but on Hulu which doesn’t have service in India,
sadly. Netflix and Amazon Prime Video are now in India as well, but the content
segregation across these two services is too high. Half the comics have their
specials on Amazon Prime. Vir Das now has a special on Netflix! There is no
“over-arching” service which one might subscribe to and be assured to get all
the latest entertainment. (I haven’t even mentioned HBO GO and Hotstar. HBO GO
isn’t even available in India yet, but has almost all the HBO shows: Veep and
Silicon Valley, both of which have an ongoing season right now)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fragmentation across entertainment services is highly undesirable, I wish
someone would fix this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forward looking P.S. Handmaid’s Tale’s Audio CD is on it’s way, I think. I am
excited about that too. My laptop doesn’t have a disk drive, which would be a
minor problem to get through before I can listen to the book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 72 - BHIM Aadhaar pay lacks a second factor; Elliot's paranoid nature</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/30/day-72"/>
   <updated>2017-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/30/day-72</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Churning out two in a row, today. I am 3 books behind schedule, as of this
writing. Today was perhaps the cut-off day for the third day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I read this article about Aadhaar and how the core biometric database
of &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of Indians that is now held by UIDAI is secured, and will be handled
in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been reading a lot of material about Aadhaar, UID, UIDAI lately, and all
of it has been pretty grim. With the introduction of things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-new-govt-app-use-fingerprint-to-pay/articleshow/58188140.cms&quot;&gt;BHIM Aadhaar
Pay&lt;/a&gt;
which requires the merchant to enter the Aadhaar number, and the customer to
use their fingerprint for making a payment, it seems like Aadhaar will be a part
of all of our lives, whether we like it or want it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BHIM Aadhaar Pay is especially insecure because of the absence of a second
factor. The only thing that is required is a fingerprint, and even The Verge
wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/2/11540962/iphone-samsung-fingerprint-duplicate-hack-security&quot;&gt;an
article&lt;/a&gt;
about this. It was pretty eye opening. Play Doh is a toy for kids, they make
stuff with it, and now it’s being used once the fingerprint has been created as
a fake finger? DERP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/30/hacker-fakes-german-ministers-fingerprints-using-photos-of-her-hands&quot;&gt;Guardian
article&lt;/a&gt;
has more information about the guy who got the German minister’s fingerprint
using just her high-res photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Elliot converted E-Corp to Evil Corp in his mind. Elliot was paranoid as
hell and destroyed his whole setup even at the slight doubt of someone having
figured him out. Elliot also mis-labelled his CDs as old rock albums to create
an efficient smoke screen that worked rather well (because the people he hung
out with weren’t into &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; kind of music). It pays to be paranoid, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 71 - A mad dash to the boarding gate; Where is Emma (the book) going?</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/29/day-71"/>
   <updated>2017-04-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/29/day-71</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am now in Chennai. 1 mad dash to the boarding gate later. The fact that
boarding gates close 25 minutes before departure totally skipped my mind. I was
strolling happily through security when Indigo ground staff called me on my
phone and asked me to rush to the gate as the flight was going to leave!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the last person on the plane, and as soon as I walked in, they announced
on the PA &lt;strong&gt;“Boarding Complete”&lt;/strong&gt;. It was a slightly harrowing experience, but
CCU is not a large enough airport and I am fairly familiar with it, so it wasn’t
&lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; harrowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I safely made the flight to Chennai, and in the past few months although I have
come across several articles about a variety of subjects. One of the most eye
catching was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/your-money/how-airline-workers-learn-to-deal-with-you.html&quot;&gt;this New York Times
article&lt;/a&gt;
about the de-escalation training that crew members go through! It was such an
eye opener that such training programs exist in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“My job is to create a situation where people can comply with me and still
save face,” he said. “If they do, I won just because they got an explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a reference to a book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12457728-cruising-attitude&quot;&gt;Cruising Attitude by Heather
Poole&lt;/a&gt;. At 262
pages, it’s fairly small and I can hope to read it. I have absolutely no clue
when, or how, yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma (Jane Austen) is the book I have been struggling to finish ever since a
long time now. I am 2 books behind schedule on my Goodreads 40 books this year
challenge. Yesterday, being a travel day gave some good progress. It was still
not enough. I am two volumes of the book in, and this is the third volume.
Everyone has been sufficiently hated by Emma, everyone has sufficiently harassed
Harriet, and adored F Churchill, and adored/hated Elton. Where is the story
going and how is it going to come to an end?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would bet that Emma ends up falling in love and eventually marrying one of the
people. Frank seems to be the obvious choice, Knightley is interestingly in love
with the idea of Emma but not with the person herself, it appears. Jane Fairfax
is a crazy puzzle piece that fits somewhere. I am not sure where though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it will be an exciting finish because seldom have books left the
reader in such a dark alley, after making it 60% to their destination!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 70 - The existence of a Kurt Cobain biopic;</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/28/day-70"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is definitely going to be unique. I am writing from an airport. Yeah,
typing stuff on a laptop (even if it is gibberish or this) is an experience
worth recording somewhere. I am in the Calcutta Airport, waiting to get on a
flight to Chennai in about 90 minutes from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shenanigans of gettting to the airport are hard enough, if you live in IIT
Kharagpur or studied there. You get on a taxi from the institute to the KGP
train station, a train to Howrah (one of Calcutta’s train stations), then get on
a taxi from Howrah to the airport. There are so many legs you must go through to
do a simple 2 hour flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, 28th April 2017 was the last day of Semester 8. I definitely plan to
write a semester review post, this is not going to be that. That has to be
“written”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, after the United Airlines and (disproportionately) high number of
incidents related to airports and air travel in the past 4 months, I am not
really &lt;em&gt;nervous&lt;/em&gt; by any accounts. Excited would sum it up more accurately, I
think. Demented, some might complain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I had a conversation about movies, Movies that are &lt;em&gt;must watch movies&lt;/em&gt;
and I was told about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4229236&quot;&gt;Montage of Heck
(2015)&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a Kurt Cobain biography movie
thingy! KURT COBAIN &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3. I have seen his interview clips (almost
all of them) from the 1990s, and the persona of coolness that he exudes is
incredible! YOU &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; fall in love with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, it’s a cartoon movie intercut with actual montages of his old
photos! This is going right to the top of my watchlist for now.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 69 - Music and Temperature</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/27/day-69"/>
   <updated>2017-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/27/day-69</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is one of the posts that I hope to be proud of when I am done with this 100
days of writing marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, moods and music have been closely connected. I think
temperatures are too. Stay with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a hot summer day (hot is about 35-40 degrees celsius, here in India),
listening to an Arctic Monkeys song that is racing through is hard. I might
listen to it for a bit, but I eventually end up feeling &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt;. Especially, songs
from Favourite Worst Nightmare. The best example is If You Were There, Beware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZVOwOzL9uDQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The songs starts out slightly less heavier than it gets, which makes it a bit
more enticing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas, now compare it to the following two songs. They instantly make you feel
light and cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DrjMgzVoCB8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aihu16RyYp8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Lana Del Rey songs seem to induce a laid-back, let’s sleep this one out
attitude on the listener. I first binged on Summertime Sadness for a whole month
in the Summer of 2014. I hadn’t heard any of her other songs then, but that one
song that I heard and it’s video was enough to put me through May 2014, in
temperatures that were way over 40 degrees in Kharagpur. Listening to it now, I
feel like that song was incredibly “&lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt;” and there was definitely something
off with me for having heard it and liked it in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TdrL3QxjyVw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus fact:&lt;/strong&gt; I had no clue what Summertime Sadness was, when I first heard
the song. I liked the lyrics though, they were poetic and each sentence merged
into the other. That is a feeling I have about Lana’s music even today. (She
released a single a few days back.) Now that I know what it means, the video
makes a lot more sense. It builds up to the climax that I didn’t understand
before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some songs I couldn’t quite figure out, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cjVQ36NhbMk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFRkpvvop3I&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/m1xN7w07EWM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s probably because these songs don’t really have any unique “temperature” to
them. They are cold-blooded, they adapt to the temperature their listener is in.
That’s a pretty cool analogy, I feel. But, who am I, really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. (to a post that I was hoping would be great but turned out to be slightly
above average): I have been meaning to do a chronological music catalogue in
which I list what all artists, bands and people making music I love. Something
that I could look back on 10 years from now and reflect at how mature / immature
/ misled I was, at this point in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would give anything to have a Year In Review video for every single year of my
life. Something that is incredibly fast paced and basically a clone of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=633rwYgYJDs&quot;&gt;this
Casey Neistat video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/633rwYgYJDs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

   <title>Day 68 - Internet shutdown in Kashmir again; Continous threat assessment</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/26/day-68"/>
   <updated>2017-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/26/day-68</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some more bizarre things happened today, 27th April, 2017. Not so bizarre, now
that I know that Internet shutdowns were common. This is definitely the first
internet shutdown that I have seen in the papers. Actually noticed. Kashmir now
has a block on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/world/asia/kashmir-shuts-down-social-networks-for-a-month.html&quot;&gt;21 social networks for the next
month&lt;/a&gt;.
These are the social networks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-68-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just had to laugh when I saw Tumblr, Pinterest and Snapchat on that list.
Seriously, who is sharing even the anticipated &lt;a href=&quot;/public/img/day-68-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;objectionable
materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More &lt;a href=&quot;https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/04/26/more-lastpass-flaws-researcher-pokes-holes-in-2fa/&quot;&gt;bad
news&lt;/a&gt;
for LastPass’ security team and all users of a password manager that is either
Lastpass itself or something else. I have never been comfortable giving anyone
access to my passwords. Even if it is a metal box that no human being &lt;em&gt;promises&lt;/em&gt;
to ever look at. Managing passwords on your own is slightly involved and often
irritating, but it is totally worth the risk. The one thing that I would
recommend that everyone do is: &lt;strong&gt;Keep assessing the amount of threat that you
are under of being attacked, and the worst case scenarios if you indeed get
attacked&lt;/strong&gt; If you do this on a regular, unconscious level, then you will
eventually not have to actively think about what might happen. You are always
thinking about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sample scenario: What happens if I left my computer unlocked for 10 minutes
and went somewhere and someone used the computer for 9 minutes during that
period. In that case, I would lose my RSA private keys and probably give them
access to all the servers I have access to (and have stored in my
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; for about 6 minutes if they are really fast at getting situated)
In 6 minutes, most servers can be taken down. They would still not have &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;
access on these servers, so they would have to run something like the fork bomb
which is easily solved by a reboot. The
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Main_Page&quot;&gt;Metakgp&lt;/a&gt; server takes about 16 minutes to
reboot, that’s a total down time of nearly 17-20 minutes at most. They would
also get my RSA private keys, which would mean that I would have to contact
someone to immediately remove my old keys and refresh them with new keys
everywhere. This might take considerably more time and effort and this is
probably the thing I would be most concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They might definitely be able to get a file-tree of my complete hard drive
(although that’s pushing it, because the last time I ran &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tree /&lt;/code&gt; it took 1.5
hours to complete. Yes, that’s 1 TB worth of files’ list). They might be able to
get &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; information, but it would still not be enough to do anything with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But going into the browser, things escalate really quickly. If they don’t care
about my RSA keys, then within minutes with a decent internet connection, the
attacker should be easily able to cause havoc with my primary email account,
a Facebook account. Send out emails which will be very hard to explain, messages
that might be embarassing at the worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, these threats are bad enough for me to force me to lock my computer
before leaving, even if it is just for a couple minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might note that I have also just assesed the threats for the case where
someone guesses or gets my computer’s login password from somewhere. The
problems and the scenarios would be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, keep assessing and thinking about how things could go wrong. Most of the
security stuff that I have realised have been in retrospect, and the
helplessness is rather crippling.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ah, I have been running two days late now. Right now is 27th April, 1733. This
post should have been out on 25th April before I slept. I came down with a bad
cold and fever yesterday. So, now I have to manufacture two posts in quick
succession. I still have one more exam to give tomorrow. &lt;em&gt;Nah, no big deal!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IIT Delhi’s website got attacked, alongwith a lot of other Indian websites. Now,
apparently, it wasn’t the website servers themselves that got hacked but the DNS
provider, ERNET that got hacked. And after the DNS providers got hacked, they
remained in that state for about 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, on the same day, only a few hours before this fiasco, &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/iit-delhi-ballot-paper-high-tech-software-hacking/1/919885.html&quot;&gt;this
article&lt;/a&gt;
about IIT Delhi using online voting systems for student elections came out. I
don’t mean to get into an alma mater war here, but anyone who has designed and
built web applications knows that voting systems are rather simple systems to
build because the constraints that are applied in the real world are pretty
stringent: fixed number of voting booths, constant surveillance of the people
coming and voting, validation is done by human beings and not the software.
Also, IIT Kharagpur has been using online voting systems for the past 4 years at
the very least. Probably, even before that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate part of this is that there won’t be any post mortem of this
particular attack. Cloudfare recently got attacked with their weird missing NULL
character bug, but they published a detailed post mortem about the attack, when
they found out about it, how they mitigated it and all kinds of details. That
kind of data reassures users and also helps others prevent similar attacks
against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also ended up re-watching two movies that I have watched several times
already. I don’t know what I hope to get from watching them again and again, I
believe there’s something about the story, the sophistication of the story
telling, the subtlety with which the story unfolds and &lt;em&gt;most importantly&lt;/em&gt;, the
hope that is the underlying driving factor for both stories: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/&quot;&gt;Contagion
(2011)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1549572/&quot;&gt;Another Earth
(2011)&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, both movies were
made in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an auxilliary note, Audible got back regarding the main narration on
Handmaid’s Tale’s audiobook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-67-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a few added scenes. Their customer service response was rather fast, to be
honest.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 66 - Examinations and Time</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/24/day-66"/>
   <updated>2017-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/24/day-66</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At school and college, there is a laid back approach to exams. 5 exams in a
month, in some places.  Some study leave before the first exam: in the order of
a week to a month for practical exams. Lots and lots of free time. Before the
exams begin, before each exam. All of this is wasted time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not here. Both the mid term and the end term exam sessions are 7-8 working days.
They generally start on a Monday and end the next Tuesday. Sometimes, they start
on a Thursday and end the next Friday. There’s no official “study leave”.
Professors start to wind up their teaching about a week before the last class if
they have planned it well, a lot of professors teach right till 2 days before
their subject’s End Term. That’s just how it works. &lt;strong&gt;Exams are a marathon&lt;/strong&gt;
Inspite of that, I am glad for it. All of the time that is forced on you to
study for an exam, is wasted time that you could have spent doing something more
important and worthwhile if there wasn’t an exam looming over your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up at 7 am this morning, I have an exam at 2 pm. I am not frantically
turning pages and studying. It is 9:45 am right now, and I haven’t opened a
single notebook yet. &lt;strong&gt;I have stolen away this time from my preparation to do
something I love to do&lt;/strong&gt;, knowing that the time I have after completing this post
will be enough for me to get through whatever preparation is left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exam will end at 5 pm, my next exam is on Thursday. There again I will steal
an hour’s worth of doing something I like: Reading Emma, writing some more,
working on a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write about this today because when I woke up this morning, I realised that I
had woken up early and I wasn’t feeling bad about it. I didn’t have to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;
anywhere, yet I was up early. If anything, I was happy about the few extra hours
I was getting. &lt;a href=&quot;http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/advice.html&quot;&gt;This essay&lt;/a&gt;
by Andrej Karpathy is on point. My favourite quote from it is this section,
right at the end of the essay:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Undergrads tend to have tunnel vision about their classes. They want to get
good grades, etc. The crucial fact to realize is that &lt;strong&gt;noone will care about
your grades, unless they are bad&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, I always used to say that the
smartest student will get 85% in all of his courses. This way, you end up with
somewhere around 4.0 score, but you did not over-study, and you did not
under-study.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Your time is a precious, limited resource. Get to a point where you don’t
screw up on a test and then switch your attention to much more important
endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never been asked about my grade point or my grade in a particular subject
during an interview. I feel rather proud about a few and used to put them in my
CV, until I realised that no one cares. As long as I have a number above 8 out
of 10 in my CV, they know that I haven’t screwed up really bad and hence, it
isn’t even talked about in most interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of exams that I have given from being a staunch part of the Indian
education system is staggering. I have been giving exams right since I was 6
years old. School was filled with periodic exams. Preparation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://jeeadv.ac.in/&quot;&gt;JEE
2013&lt;/a&gt; increased that number astronomically, with 6 hour
tests given every other week for a whole year. Just after coming to college, I
have probably given hundreds of exams and class tests and lab tests. All of this
test taking makes you a little bit de-sensitized to an exam. &lt;strong&gt;They become
regular occurences that hold no more significance than you choose to give
them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to write a &lt;strong&gt;TL; DR&lt;/strong&gt; for this post, I am having a hard time
figuring out what it A would be though. I wanted to make a point about exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exams are not about how well you are prepared for them or how much time you
spent preparing. They are about recognising what you need to study and where
that will get you. They are about optimizing your preparation so you can get the
best out of each test. They are about understanding the circumstances of every
single course: the professor, the grading patterns, the question papers.  They
are about figuring out what score you are going to be okay with, because that
number is different for each one of us. Lastly, &lt;strong&gt;they are about realising that
when exams are looming over your head, you needn’t hit pause on the rest of your
life&lt;/strong&gt;.  You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; plan well enough to keep your life playing and still score
well. It’s possible, and once you give a lot of tests, you will end up doing it
subconciously, there will be no explicit writing down of dates and times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a good &lt;em&gt;TL; DR&lt;/em&gt;, I feel. It encapsulates what I have always meant to tell
students giving their first few exams. Exams are a complicated topic of
discourse because of all the uncertainties and variables that come with every
test you take. I have tried to summarise my experiences above. If you have given
a lot of exams and have wanted to share your perspective with the world, sure
do. The more viewpoints new people get, the more easily they can find their own.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 65 - Handmaid's Tale performed by Claire Danes, Fargo (1996) - DISTURBING</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/23/day-65"/>
   <updated>2017-04-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/23/day-65</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/317735717&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handmaid’s Tale was released as an audiobook. That’s not the best part of the
news. The best part: &lt;strong&gt;It is narrated by CLAIRE DANES&lt;/strong&gt;. OH MY!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the above excerpts on Audible’s Soundcloud, and they are &lt;em&gt;DOPE!&lt;/em&gt;. This
audiobook also has some new material, that was added by Margaret Atwood herself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TV series of this book is going to premiere on 26th April, in 3 days. The
trailer for that series (which is going to be on Hulu) is also stirring. There’s
a lot of new material for this book coming out this year. AH, SUCH GREAT TIMES!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was rather stunned with the Audiobook version that Claire Danes performed. I
have since found that there are two versions here, in 2013, Claire Danes
performed this book for the first time. THat won a few awards and was wildly
popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it seems she has performed this again(?) or they have used the same audio
again. From the reviews on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.audible.com/pd/Fiction/The-Handmaids-Tale-Special-Edition-Audiobook/B06XFW9YZ5/ref=t2_asin_pd_anonhp&quot;&gt;new Audible
listing&lt;/a&gt;,
it seems that they &lt;em&gt;added&lt;/em&gt; scenes to the audiobook, an essay, an afterword by
the author herself, a Q&amp;amp;A with the professor (which appears as an epilogue in
the book), but the main voice acting that Claire Danes did has been left
unchanged. The old &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.in/Handmaids-Tale-Classic-Collection/dp/1480560103/ref=sr_1_1_twi_mp3_6&quot;&gt;Amazon.in
listing&lt;/a&gt; for the MP3 CD
that has the older audiobook is great! I think I will pick that up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audible’s pricing is pretty confusing too, I am not sure if it’s a subscription
or if you can simply buy a single book and be done with it. Why does it have to
be so confusing? Amazon seems to have made buying Books and e-Books simpler, but
Audible is still a confusing maze that I have been stuck in. (I would love to
use the trial and buy this book, but would it then mean that I will have this
book forever or it will just lapse after 30 days and I won’t have access
anymore?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also this YouTube promotional video that was released in 2012:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hmdfdx3IKN0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quiver in her voice when she talks about “Her Story” is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; recognizable
from her difficult scenes in Homeland (especially the one in which Quinn ( :( )
and Carrie shoot a video to show Franny in the previous season).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/&quot;&gt;Fargo
(1996)&lt;/a&gt; today. The fact that these events
actually happened in reality is pretty disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 64 - My thoughts on a Quora answer I disliked, why are titles on Medium so clickbait-y?</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/22/day-64"/>
   <updated>2017-04-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/22/day-64</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, a friend shared [this Quora
answer]https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-psychological-facts-that-people-dont-know-1/answer/Dorottya-T%C3%B3th) which ended up with it appearing on my news feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the answer and instantly disliked the contentions made by the author. I
was going to let it go, until someone asked me to ellaborate on &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I disliked
the answer. I had to think about this for just a bit, after which I came up with
this &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; long answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ah, thanks for making me think more about it! :D&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;First of all, if writing was Tom’s true dream, he ought to have done something
concrete towards it. But let’s not talk about that, because he probably has a
lot of reasons why he can’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Sam doesn’t exist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If writing is your dream and you have a day-job, you can find maybe 1 hour of
worthwhile free time that you might spend doing something else. Say Tom doesn’t
tell anyone about his writing habits, and just does it alone (apparently Tom can
achieve anything then), does he write enough?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When you start anything big, the excitement is very high, you might put in upto
6-7 hours of writing the first day, but you will always get to a point where
that initial excitement is gone and this is the pivotal point for any project.
You must either struggle through it and stick with your project or ditch it.
This is when you struggle for motivation, struggle to find content, struggle to
decide whether you should keep at it or just drop it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you made a public proclamation, your friends will keep asking about it, the
closest ones for sure. It’s embarassing to accept that you didn’t go through
with something that you were so passionate about, because accepting that you
stopped to someone else is simply an indirect way of admitting it to yourself.
You really wanted to do something, and you couldn’t go through with it. What
does that say about you? How did your perception of yourself change?
Negatively, I argue.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Someone who doesn’t tell any of his friends anything and just publishes a book
doesn’t exist. That just doesn’t happen. Everyone slowly moves towards their
goal, they don’t just &lt;em&gt;GET&lt;/em&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this is a generalisation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Everyone is different, following your dreams and passions is a topic that’s been
heavily written about offline and online. People have always wanted that single
formula to get there, to become a writer or a film-maker or whatever.  The fact
that it’s been so long, and there’s no formula yet is enough to prove that no
such formula exists.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;No such formula exists because EVERY SINGLE SITUATION IS DIFFERENT. That’s the
core reason for my dislike of this answer. This is an overly simplified answer
about a very complicated, specific problem: How do you get to where you want to
be, from where you are? There’s no one single way to do that, and consequently,
there’s no single way you can completely screw it up either. Every step in any
direction is a step towards the goal or away from it, but making progress is
more important than making sure that each step you take goes towards the goal.
(Some of Casey Neistat’s videos have really detailed explanations of goals and
life and the path to take to get there. All of the above has formed from my own
experiences with ambitious projects and accomplished people’s views on the
topic)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nit picks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The question asks for psychological facts, facts are generally supported by
research that is either biological or done using control groups and analysis.
They are not things that you can come up with using fictional characters and
thought experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The comments of that answer have some references to a 2009 paper. That paper is
shaky, IMHO. If you believe that the experiment that was performed was to the
point and is an accurate representation, good for you. :)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relatability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There’s no getting around the fact that more than 10,000 people thought that
answer was a good one. Maybe the answer is relatable, that doesn’t make the
answer true. Just because something happened to 10,000 people doesn’t mean
that’s the only way to do that thing. There are other ways too. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have definitely written down everything that I didn’t like about the answer.
One of the responses to this comment was very interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I agree to your point that it’s an “overly simplified answer” - &lt;strong&gt;something most
writers on Quora/Medium tend to do to bring the focus on to one focal point&lt;/strong&gt;,
often off reality. For example, I completely agree that the ideal Sam as
described doesn’t exist. It’s sometimes got to be taken with a pinch of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bringing the focus onto one point is a major reason for my moving off of
these two platforms. Medium especially faces this problem a lot. Most of the
articles on Medium are preachy, clickbaity or give you a list to do something.
Frankly, it’s rather irritating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Quora is something that has content which can be enjoyed as entertainment,
one must never make the mistake of taking Quora answers and associating them to
words that are even near as strong as “facts”. Most things on Quora are
experience based, and only those questions are worth reading. That said, there
is something off about these two platforms. Maybe it’s the lack of curation and
the algorithmic suggestion of articles based on our past reads, which in most
cases are just one-time reads to understand a topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I saw a Medium article about “Why people should write”, that doesn’t mean you
fill my newsfeed with “How to become a great writer in 6 months” articles for
the next 10 years. That doesn’t make any sense. These platforms perhaps work
best when you use them as your primary source for user created content. If you
consume content across the Internet, you are probably going to have a bad
experience with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove my point, I will show the first few posts on my Medium feed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-64-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;**
&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-64-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;
**&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-64-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;**
&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-64-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;
**&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-64-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;
***&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I am aware that I am &lt;strong&gt;judging an article by it’s title and thumbnail&lt;/strong&gt; and
that some of these articles might be really good. But the fact that all those
titles irritate me and I would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; click on something like that is enough to
understand that I would never get to know whether those articles were good or
not. &lt;strong&gt;Can we tone it down, please?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like less Clickbait-y, more news-like titles which don’t give me a list,
or tell me what I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; do, but a title that tells me what the content of the
article is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have reached here, take all of that with a table spoon of salt
because I don’t spend any time on Medium and I don’t know anything about how the
articles with irritating titles are underneath the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 62 - Frustratingly stalled at 40% of Emma, Juicero meltdown, Plastc shutdown despite $9 million</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/20/day-62"/>
   <updated>2017-04-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/20/day-62</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Emma has been out of this blog for a few posts now. I have made absolutely no
progress with it! Frustratingly, I am still stuck at around 38%. With exams
Saturday, and 4 days of the next week, there is &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; no way to read
any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the influence of
such a happy face as Mr. Weston’s, confirmed as it all was by the words and
the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but not less to the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Mr. Weston just told Emma that Frank was going to visit the next day, at
dinner time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I read till about 40% in the past 15 minutes. This was the first time that
Frank meets Emma, I have a feeling I know how this is going to go. So,
basically, Emma loves Frank, but Frank loves Jane Fairfax(?) or Harriet. Harriet
is definitely a stretch, because Frank appears to be the cunning wolf-kinda guy.
All of this complete speculation, I am rather confident in it though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juicero had a meltdown, sort of. Bloomberg published a video that said the juice
can be squeezed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-04-19/silicon-valley-s-400-juicer-may-be-feeling-the-squeeze&quot;&gt;by hand, and the machine wasn’t
needed&lt;/a&gt;,
and Juicero’s CEO immediately shot back &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Juicero/a-note-from-juiceros-new-ceo-cb23a1462b03&quot;&gt;on
Medium&lt;/a&gt;
and offered to refund everyone who bought their Juicer machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That means that if you send us your Press, we’ll refund the money you paid for
it. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, that’s a really really good save. While how many people might
&lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; refund their machines, is still to be seen, I think most people will
probably not do it. The convenience that a $400(!!!) juicepress machine offers
is much much higher than the hand squeezed juice that could be made out of the
same packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish Uber had execs like these who would come out right after something bad
happens, talk about their product, apologise, accept that they need to improve
and TAKE ACTION! Unfortunately, they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while that was happening, a plastic card company that promised a single card
that could store a lot of cards &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/20/15375842/plastc-bankrupt-campaign-fold-backers&quot;&gt;closed
down&lt;/a&gt;.
Amid really unusual circumstances, they had about $9 million in pre-orders and
couldn’t close two rounds of about $8 million dollars in funding. &lt;em&gt;How could
they possibly need $17 million to send out pre-orders?&lt;/em&gt; It’s very unusual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coin was acquired by FitBit and there has been no word since, they ran their
service for some time, and after that they shut down everything. What is it
about these digital cards and companies that make them not making it?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 61 - So, you think webcams can't be turned on without the indicator light?</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/19/day-61"/>
   <updated>2017-04-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/19/day-61</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2 days ago, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/security/cryptography/lists/2017/04/17/day-59/&quot;&gt;this
list&lt;/a&gt;
about improving your security online and practices that you should follow. The
last point on that list was &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Tape your webcam&lt;/code&gt;. The question that most people
seem to have is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are there any existing exploits which can turn on your webcam without turning
on the light that is there next to it? How widespread are these lights?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why should I tape the webcam if I have nothing to hide? (This was the
argument used by Shailene Woodley’s character in the movie Snowden (2016)).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the FBI director Comey answered both these the best:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I saw something in the news, so I copied it. I put a piece of tape — I have
obviously a laptop, personal laptop — I put a piece of tape over the camera.
Because I saw somebody smarter than I am had a piece of tape over their camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/08/473548674/why-the-fbi-director-puts-tape-over-his-webcam&quot;&gt;From npr.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what did he say about the second question?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You go into any government office, we all have our little camera things that
sit on top of the screen. They all have a little lid that closes down on them,
You do that so that people who don’t have authority don’t look at you. I think
that’s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heck-yeah-i-still-cover-my-webcam-with-tape-fbi-director/story-Mdxy4PUPUMSAoXP0M3ZVcO.html&quot;&gt;From
hindustantimes.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of all of that, I think my point about protecting your privacy because
the existence of exploits might be questioned but by the time that these
exploites are released to the public, it will most certainly be too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if you know about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbins_v._Lower_Merion_School_District&quot;&gt;Lower Merion School
District&lt;/a&gt;
case in which the School district gave laptops to all their students and
installed an anti-theft tracking software and used that to capture photos of
their students at periodic intervals. Most students noticed that the green light
next to their camera used to flash now and then, and they found it creepy but
the people at the school reassured them that it was a technical glitch (which is
the easiest out) and let it go. They paid heavily for their indiscretions and
SICK actions, it &lt;em&gt;must be&lt;/em&gt; noted though that the photos are out there and they
might have been deleted or handed over, nonetheless some people have seen it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further research for about 30-40 minutes on sites like the StackExchange site
for &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Information Security&lt;/a&gt;, Quora and news
websites led me to &lt;strong&gt;several&lt;/strong&gt; articles that detailed exploits and attackers
getting access to webcams and using those to click pictures. There is a dearth
of articles in 2014 and 2015, which is intriguing, but 2013 was the time that
this issue was at it’s highest popularity and there are many articles from the
second part of that year. So, &lt;em&gt;read on!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  A Quora question with some surprisingly good answers about whether taping
  your webcam is something everyone should do&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this time, after reading all of that, I think you should be sufficiently
convinced about 1. the possibility of the existence of exploits 2. that someone
or the other is watching and it’s not right to let them watch without your
permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a sidenote, I didn’t find those articles in the exact chronological order
that I have presented them in (obviously). After creating a list entry for each
of them, I had to sort them. I probably did using Quick Sort, because I
inherently created year pivots and grouped all of 2016’s articles together, same
for 2015, 2013 and then once I had a clear distinction between these two sets, I
moved the whole 2013 before 2015 and so on. Probably not traditional quick sort
but I think that’s the algorithm that comes closest to describing what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 60 - Nostalgia hits - Masaan and Lunchbox, Search for the Indian Railway Commercial Ticketing Manual</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/18/day-60"/>
   <updated>2017-04-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/18/day-60</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday’s post, that I wrote 13 hours ago, was one of the most detailed and
informative blog posts that I have written in this series for about 20 days now.
I shared it with a lot of people, I hope people see it, read it and implement
some of those measures in their lives too. For me, to implement all of those
things took almost a year. I started with 2FA and now, I have implemented all of
them. It takes considerable time and effort to implement some of those measures,
but the time spent will be well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a strong bout of nostalgia today, movies related. I watched scenes from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4635372/&quot;&gt;Masaan (2015)&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2350496/&quot;&gt;Lunchbox (2013)&lt;/a&gt;. A few
letters, some great songs, some incredibly good actors. And scenes that are
&lt;em&gt;memorable&lt;/em&gt; for life. I wish they made more movies like this in the present
times. Unsurprisingly, when I think of the last movie that I saw and really
liked, the latest one I can remember is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2178470/?ref_=nv_sr_1&quot;&gt;Yeh Jawani Hain
Deewani&lt;/a&gt; which was released 4
years ago. It’s a sad state of affairs. (P.S. I really wish the publicity for
Masaan had been great and I had seen that movie in a movie theater!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Masaan had an especially dark middle part of the movie, it was a heart breaking
scene to be honest. There are many spoilers to be given here, and I won’t talk
about them. It hits you like a train would, I imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunchbox had this insanely suspenseful sequence in it’s middle when suicide is
on the cards for Nimrat Kaur’s character and her daughter. The picturing of the
whole thing, my knowledge of the copycat effect and how it affects events like
these, had my brain running full speed to find some way out of this. Some way to
convince myself it won’t happen. It didn’t end up happening, I am &lt;em&gt;SO&lt;/em&gt; glad for
that. Sad endings only work to give the movie a bittersweet taste where you
remember the movie for that particular bad event and everything else happened
before and after, but that one bad event is always the defining moment for you
in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Masaan, Pankaj Tripathi’s character, who is an Indian Railways ticketing
agent, has a book called the “Indian Railways Commercial Ticketing Manual” in
his hand. Apparently, this manual consists of the instructions for new ticketing
agents to learn how to generate tickets for their customers at the counter. A
preliminary search lead me to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&amp;amp;id=0,5,377&quot;&gt;listing
page&lt;/a&gt;
for Codes, Manuals related to IR. The only manual that I could find which had a
similar name was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/codesmanual/CommManual-I/main%20page.htm&quot;&gt;Indian Railways Commercial Manual: Vol
1&lt;/a&gt;
I can’t be sure if this is the same book or not, I see no reason for them to put
the manual online for anyone to read, but the difference in name could simply be
because the online document was last published in 1992. That’s right! 25 YEARS
AGO! There must definitely be a newer, better document that has the exact
Ticketing information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that I &lt;a href=&quot;https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/proposals/trip-diary/railways/2017/03/12/day-23/&quot;&gt;wrote a post about
this&lt;/a&gt;,
it is my duty to find out as much as I can. Expect a comprehensive account of my
search for the evasive Ticketing Manual: Vol 1 in the coming few posts in this
series!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 59 - A list of things to improve your security online</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/17/day-59"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A new day, a new attack on HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Can you
tell which is phishing? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&amp;#39;t. That&amp;#39;s the problem with
Unicode look-a-like character substitution. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/431d4dNwGT&quot;&gt;https://t.co/431d4dNwGT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/r18CLNCXcE&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/r18CLNCXcE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Michael
Coates (@_mwc) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_mwc/status/853395181437042689&quot;&gt;April 15,
2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking certificates is a great practice, and almost always I stop after
opening a certificate and looking at the certificate signing chain. That tells
most of the story. Specifically, when using some other computer, it tells you
whether the computer’s owner is trying to fake some certificate sign by putting
a malicious Gmail certificate on the computer and effectively implementing a
MITM attack. It’s as simple as installing &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitmproxy.org/&quot;&gt;MITM Proxy&lt;/a&gt;
which automatically creates a certificate and adds it to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/ssl/certs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid this is to not login on any unknown device, at all. There
are some guidelines like these that I have learned from experience, and although
listing them all down is going to be next to impossible, I can try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; use Google Authenticator for 2-Factor Authentication. Use it for all the accounts that
tell the world who you are: Email, Twitter (THEY IMPLEMENTED IT!), LastPass, GitHub, Digital
Ocean, Slack. (Those are &lt;em&gt;a few&lt;/em&gt; of the services I use 2FA for)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/854151800462741506&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2017-04-18-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T&lt;/strong&gt; login to your core accounts on an unknown computer. There could be
anything ranging from a hardware keylogger that you didn’t notice, a software
keylogger which can be installed in 2 minutes on Windows or a malicious SSL
MITM attacker who went to the pain of faking a certificate chain to reduce
your suspicions. JUST DON’T. To download or share files, read the next point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; setup a publicly viewable Google Drive folder and create a shortlink
for that folder and add it to your contacts. Whenever you want to download
something on a strange computer, use your phone to put it on the public
folder, download it and then delete it from Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; use DuckDuckGo. They don’t track you, they don’t even ask you to sign
in. If you must use Google because sometimes DDG just doesn’t cut it, open
Incognito and use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;!google&lt;/code&gt; before your query. That way the searches are not
tied to your account and you can save yourself from targetted advertising
based on your searches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; use a VPN whenever using Public WiFi. Something as simple as Surfeasy
is enough to thwart people trying to spy on you using simple things like
Wireshark. I know hardly anything about the myriad list of tools available
out there to spy on people who are using a public network. Using a VPN should
preclude some really basic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T&lt;/strong&gt; enter your Bank Password or anything related to Internet Banking
&lt;em&gt;WITHOUT&lt;/em&gt; first checking the SSL certificate of the website. If chrome shows
the green bar, don’t stop there. Press &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CTRL+SHIFT+I&lt;/code&gt;, open the certificate
and atleast look at the certificate. Look at the spelling of the website (Our
brain does this weird thing where &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://onlinsbi.com&lt;/code&gt; looks so so
similar to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://onlinesbi.com&lt;/code&gt;. I used to be terrified of this particular
attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; use &lt;em&gt;STRONG PASSWORDS&lt;/em&gt;. This is a no-brainer, really, but I still feel
like I must say this. 8 character long passwords are the bare minimum and
just don’t cut it. Something as simple as
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thc.org/thc-hydra/&quot;&gt;thc-hydra&lt;/a&gt; has bruteforcing options for
passwords that are this small.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; use LONG RSA keys. If possible, use Elliptic Curve keys. In any case,
your default RSA key should ideally be 4096 bits long. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.g3rt.nl/upgrade-your-ssh-keys.html&quot;&gt;This guide will help
you upgrade your keys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; have a small Pendrive that has your RSA keys, PGP keys (Who uses PGP
anymore?), your 2FA recovery codes. Take it with you whenever you are going
on a sufficiently long trip. &lt;strong&gt;Remember to use LUKS&lt;/strong&gt; and encrypt the
partition that has all this data. Otherwise, you are just inviting trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; uninstall &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openssh-server&lt;/code&gt; from your main computer. It’s an annoying
package that doesn’t come pre-installed in Ubuntu, but if you ended up
installing it somehow, uninstall it right now! &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sshd&lt;/code&gt; is one of those
tunnels into your machine you didn’t even know existed until someone walked
right in and stole files from you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; follow Security and Cryptography blogs using something like Feedly.
The best two out there right now are
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/&quot;&gt;cryptographyengineering.com&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/&quot;&gt;Bruce Schneier on Security&lt;/a&gt;. If you use Twitter
a lot, follow some Security driven accounts like
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FiloSottile&quot;&gt;Filippo&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity&quot;&gt;@SwiftOnSecurity&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evacide&quot;&gt;@evacide&lt;/a&gt;. I know I follow a lot more people
who are in the &lt;em&gt;industry&lt;/em&gt;, but I can’t seem to remember them. I would like
to create a Twitter list of these people and then, pass that list around.
(That list probably already exists?)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; follow Cryptography news closely and go beyond the mainstream media
to find out &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what the attack is. Media headlines are generally
click-baity and say things like &lt;strong&gt;The NSA can now see your bank passwords&lt;/strong&gt;
when the actual attack is an attack on HTTPS which requires a
particular set of conditions to be met, and these conditions are never
really met for most people. This is just a random example. My point is: Go
beyond the mainstream media, go to the paper / article that the attacker
published, read through it, think about it, and finally, &lt;strong&gt;take measures to
preclude it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; use Full Disk Encryption on your Ubuntu main computer. It’s a pain to
setup, you probably are going to have to take a whole backup and then
encrypt and copy back to your disk. I did it when I re-installed Ubuntu. Do
it right away, it is well worth it. If you don’t do it right now,
&lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; do it the next time you upgrade your operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/2017/03/31/day-42/&quot;&gt;tape your
webcam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That list is no way complete. I am sure I must have missed some major point that
I really wanted to tell people about, but didn’t include in this list. I won’t
be editing this list though, I will probably publish a better version of this
list in a couple months, if I have something more to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottomline is: &lt;strong&gt;do your best to close all the doors and windows and
air-conditioning ducts&lt;/strong&gt; that enter your online apartment. If you leave doors
open, people &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; try to get in. If you close most of the doors, they will be
discouraged, and (hopefully) leave you alone and target someone who is more
vulnerable. And if you find that a door has been inadvertently left open, &lt;strong&gt;TAKE
ACTION!&lt;/strong&gt; Inaction now and regret later are a toxic combination, and the
helplessness when you realise that you could have and &lt;em&gt;should have&lt;/em&gt; taken steps

   <title>Day 58 - Reddit karma now at 978, animals see themselves in a mirror and Gnome's weird semantic versioning conventions</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/16/day-58"/>
   <updated>2017-04-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/16/day-58</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today my Reddit comment karma increased a bit more. It &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; moved slowly
towards 1000. It’s 978 right now. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/65fu1n/why_one_republican_voted_to_kill_privacy_rules/dgai291/&quot;&gt;This particular
comment&lt;/a&gt;
got me 388 KARMA! WHAT?! STAGGERING.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-58-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I also read &lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/issue/47/consciousness/what-do-animals-see-in-a-mirror-rp&quot;&gt;an
article&lt;/a&gt;
about how animals might recognise themselves in the mirror. The tests are
admittably absurd and although they appear legit, I feel like the opposition to
it have a very very valid point. Nonetheless, it’s an interesting article and
you should definitely give it a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nautilus is, in general, a great publication. I subscribed to their mailing list
which sends out emails every day (or more frequently?) with links to atleast 4-5
articles and I am never able to complete reading them by the end of the day.
That eventually ends up in a lot of unread email that never gets read and
eventually gets archived. I wish there was a simpler way to make a note of
articles that I really want to read (by looking at the headline and the first
few paragraphs of the article).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THe other Nautilus (File Manager on Ubuntu) that I &lt;a href=&quot;https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/nautilus/missed/rant/ubuntu/update/open-mic/comedy/2017/04/14/day-56/&quot;&gt;ranted about
yesterday&lt;/a&gt;
became rather anti-climactic, when I posted the same thing on r/ubuntu and
u/TingPing promptly informed me that I didn’t have the latest version of
Nautilus installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gnome 3 uses a weird semantic versioning convention system that leads to 3.14
being the 7th major release (because only even numbers are major releases) and
the latest stable release is 3.24. Ubuntu apparently ships by default and only
allows the &lt;a href=&quot;https://websetnet.com/ubuntu-1604-lts-ship-older-version-nautilus/&quot;&gt;older
release&lt;/a&gt; to
be installed through their software repositories. The only way for me to fix
this right now is to download the source and build Nautilus for myself. If the
partition irritation is solved, then the ordeal would have been well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial build failed because of the absence of a package called gio2. I hope to
pick this up some time in the near future and see if building solves the
problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONWARDS and UPWARDS! (George says this in a Seinfeld episode)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 57 - Double-Entry Book-keeping; Homeland Season 6 Finale - Let's talk</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/15/day-57"/>
   <updated>2017-04-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/15/day-57</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In yesterday’s post (which I posted about an hour ago), I said that I was going
to figure out how GnuCash worked. I made short work of that, and I have ended up
learning what the basics of Double Entry Bookkeeping are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqAaScYVeRQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole software makes a lot of sense now. I have setup the initial entry to
get started with the expense stuff (I like the report feature, hopefully I
should be able to generate some meaningful reports in a few months).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s finally time to talk about the Homeland Season 6 finale. Yeah, I
should get this out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;major-spoilers-ahead-dont-continue-if-you-ever-plan-to-watch-homeland&quot;&gt;MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD; DON’T CONTINUE IF YOU EVER PLAN TO WATCH HOMELAND&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason that spoiler notice is in HUGE font, I have often seen people
disregard that and I have been tempted to disregard it often. The couple times
that I did do it, I tried really really hard to forget the spoiler, which only
ended up solidifying the spoiler in my head. (Eventually, I ended up not
watching the thing and waiting for about 6 months or something and then coming
back to watch it, that way the spoiler even if remembered comes to my mind only
at a much later stage)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Quinn dies. Saul lives. Keane lives and when Dar Adal says “There’s
something off about her”, he was SO RIGHT. Keane has basically started her war
against the intelligence community. The stage for this whole thing starts with a
plot to assasinate Keane that is foiled by Carrie’s weird intuition and a phone
call from guess who? DAR ADAL. This one dialogue stuck in my head:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Carrie: Quinn? Are you seeing this they are evacuating the hotel. Quinn?
Dar: This isn’t Quinn, Carrie. What’s going on?
Carrie: Fuck you, Dar
Dar: Listen to me, and listen very carefully. The President-elect’s life is in
danger … Under no circumstances, allow her motorcade to leave the hotel. Do
you hear me?
Carrie: Why not?
Dar: &lt;strong&gt;Because that hotel has been vetted for months. Swept thoroughly and
repeatedly. The bomb-scare is a ruse to get her out on the street&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Carrie does stop the motorcade and Keane is saved. Quinn has to lay
down his life to save Keane. Quinn dies. It was a SAD SAD MOMENT. Rupert Friend
played one of the best characters in this show, from the first scene that Quinn
walks in on Carrie during a mission (Dar sends him) and Carrie thinks he’s there
spying for Dar and he helps her out. From then till his last scene, not once did
he let Carrie down. The shootout where there are three people in the car with
the mole inside the embassy, Quinn comes through for her. Carrie then stays back
and searches for Quinn and figures out where he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL; DR Quinn was my favourite character, has been for the past two seasons.
Carrie is the lead character, so her being a favourite is no surprise. Quinn
though. Oh, QUINN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a six week jump, Carrie is still working for the president and is some
kind of a liason between the President and the intelligence community. O’Keefe
still continues his rhetoric (which is infuriating but you know he’s not going
to change and he doesn’t do much damage, so let him rant). Max and Carrie cry in
the heartbreaking scene where they look at the photos that Quinn has. There’s a
smiling picture of Carrie in them along with his son’s photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-57-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish they would give him some sort of a prequel episode where he is with the
mother of his son and how they came about to be together and what he did that
separated them. I wish they would bring Rupert Friend back, even if it is just
for a cameo in one episode in season 7. I would say there’s a non-trivial chance
of them doing it because Quinn has quickly risen to become one of the most
beloved characters across the Internet. (Not to mention #EmmyForRupert)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this season has been one of the best TV show renewals. They have
definitely recreated the magic, suspense, the thriller in the plot that was
there in Seasons 1 and 2. At the same time, they have managed to provide the
PERFECT setup for the next season with Keane going all rogue and imprisoning
Saul (Dar was already in prison). HELL YEAH!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 56 - MISSED; Nautilus update is irritating, switching to Dolphin(?)</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/14/day-56"/>
   <updated>2017-04-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/14/day-56</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/writing/ubuntu/installation/2017/03/04/day-15/&quot;&gt;recently updated to Ubuntu
16.04&lt;/a&gt;.
(Not really recently, I updated 41 days ago :O )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongwith the update of the distribution update, I got an update for most of the
native apps. One of them: NAUTILUS. That’s the file manager thing on Ubuntu.
It’s standard, it’s everywhere, I loved it. &lt;em&gt;Used to&lt;/em&gt; love it. Now, they have
done something annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people have many partitions, I have several of them. Some of them are
encrypted, some of them are NTFS to transfer files between Windows and Ubuntu,
etc etc. Earlier, there was just one icon on the left-side task bar. Clicking
once and opening it anywhere would add a window there. And now, things are
different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each partition opens in a new window and all nautilus windows are not grouped
together. Instead, partition windows are grouped together. This is INCREDIBLY
inconvenient. I don’t have any partition up top because that takes up a lot of
icons, and that’s not what I want to waste space on. So they are dumped right at
the bottom of the sidebar, and it’s so HARD to navigate and copy files between
partitions. I have absolutely not clue why or when they decided to go ahead and
do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is so bad that even if you open a new tab in a window and then open
a new partition in that, then the tab appears as a window with some weird stuff
happening. (Like if I have partition 1 open in the first tab and partition 2 in
the second tab, clicking on the partition 2 brings that window into focus
although visibly there’s only one window!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that they have simply removed having a Nautilus window unless it’s in
the Home partition. Everything else is another window. It’s so frustrating, I am
going to be going out there and looking for a saner way to manage my files. (I
am installing Dolphin right now, hopefully Dolphin manages this situation
better)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I promised to write about Homeland’s season 6 finale, but this
particular rant took precendence over that. I have been silently enduring this
for long enough, I figured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting application I just installed was GnuCash. I use
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/terminal-wallet&quot;&gt;terminal-wallet&lt;/a&gt; for my
day-to-day finances and an Excel sheet for a larger picture. GnuCash looks like
the right replacement for the larger picture one, it has a sweet interface that
I already like, but I haven’t tested it out well, and the number and type of
accounts is confusing. I am not surprised by that though, I will crack it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Today was also the day of an Open Mic called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/1855088841395817/&quot;&gt;Live at the Apollo
13&lt;/a&gt;, there were 6 acts and it
was GOOD! I missed the first time that this happened (last year) for some
mundane reason, Yesterday was GOOD!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 55 - BTP final presentation; Metakgp Talks session 2; Watching random Seinfeld episodes</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/13/day-55"/>
   <updated>2017-04-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/13/day-55</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was the day of the BTP presentation! It was FAR BETTER than my
expectations, and the uncertainty has all been over-written for now. In about 2
weeks, I will leave for Chennai and subsequently from there to Bangalore. In
those two weeks, I have to give 5 end-term exams for the 5 subjects that I took,
most probably give a lab test for the Operations Research Lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I was thinking about a &lt;strong&gt;Semester Review&lt;/strong&gt; post on the 30th of April,
which is the first non semester day or something like that in which I go over
what all I think I learnt this semester and is worth mentioning. The more I
thought about it, the more sense it made, it would be like a real timeline of
the things that were done over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This being my 8th semester, I have missed the oppurtunity to right such posts
for my 7 previous semesters, I would have loved to have them for each semester!
Writing them in retrospect is almost definitely not the right way to go, and I
won’t even remember most of the things that must have seemed major a day after
the last end-term exam now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we also had the second Metakgp Talk session with two talks. The second
talk was by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Ashris&quot;&gt;Ashris&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ankita.diwan.98&quot;&gt;Ankita&lt;/a&gt;. It was about the
intersection between Art and Engineers and how most people are on a spectrum
going from Artists to Engineer. It was a GREAT talk and I absolutely loved the
oppurtunities for more thinking that it opened. I definitely intend to look at a
lot more about the artistic expression that must have gone into the tech
products that we all use every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion that followed this was almost an informal Metakgp meetup over
dinner, and interestingly, it brought up &lt;a href=&quot;http://sflc.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SFLC-FINAL-SURVEILLANCE-REPORT.pdf&quot;&gt;this report about Surveillance in
India&lt;/a&gt;,
for the most part the surveillance reporting that I have seen on the internet
has been based on the NSA leaks and mainly US specific intelligence and
journalism. That India has such a huge report about these things and that they
are implementing a scary surveillance program is disturbing and has essentially
made me double down on my own goal of using only products that are end-to-end
encrypted and can be trusted, because of the cryptography that powers them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a completely different note, There is a project by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OrkoHunter&quot;&gt;Himanshu&lt;/a&gt; called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/Muriel&quot;&gt;Muriel&lt;/a&gt; which lets you select a folder
containing a lot of episodes and subsequently just selecting any one show to
play any random episode of that show, ensuring that you are not just repeating
the same episodes that you keep watching and also ensuring that the choice is
independent every single time. I watch and re-watch and re-re-watch Seinfeld
Episodes every single time. I used the following macro to figure out which
episode to watch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;echo ‘SEASON ‘$(($(($RANDOM % 9)) + 1))’ EPISODE ‘$(($(($RANDOM % 24)) + 1))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the episode doesn’t exist, I simply play it again to get another episode that
exists! It worked pretty well and it’s almost no extra load at all (Muriel is an
electron app packaged in a 45 MB zip of some kind. I don’t know anything about
Electron packaging of apps, I believe it is similar to python packaging into Deb
files back in the day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I will probably implement a more generic script that will list all the
folders, choose one randomly, then go into that folder, select a folder / file
there randomly and so on. All Linux and Bash users in general will be able to
use this script and it should do a lot of people a lot of good. I know it will
do me a lot of good! :smile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, @SeinfeldTV on Twitter replied to a tweet of mine! EXCITED OUT OF MY
MIND (It’s not that big a deal, I know, still excited though):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SeinfeldTV/status/852263717588705281&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2017-04-12-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 54 - 80 hour work weeks; 100 hour work weeks(!!); BURN OUT</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/12/day-54"/>
   <updated>2017-04-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/12/day-54</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found myself thinking about how people survive and put in 80-hour work weeks
or 100 hour work weeks. Assuming that you put in 80 hours over the 7 days of a
week, that gives you about 11 hours of work each day. On top of this, there is
the commute time from your home to your office. That will be atleast 30 minutes
for most people anyway. Add 1 more hour for lunch, and that comes to an even 13
hours each day. Say you leave your house at 7:00 AM, you will come back at 8 PM.
Sufficiently exhausted to not be able to do anything except eat and sleep so
that you can get back up the next morning. And I am assuming that people put in
the same amount of time on saturdays and sundays as well, so basically you would
never have any holiday! It’s more likely that you will put in &lt;em&gt;MORE&lt;/em&gt; time on
weekdays and less time on the weekends. Still, WHAT?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100 hour work weeks are even more insane. To put it all in perspective, a week
has 7 days, which is 168 hours. You have just decided to give up 2/3rd of your
whole week to work! With 8 hours of sleep everyday, the total number of hours
that you are literally not working or sleeping every single day reduces to a
meager 3 hours! It is a concept that I couldn’t wrap my brain around. Pop
culture has a plethora of references to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/upshot/how-some-men-fake-an-80-hour-workweek-and-why-it-matters.html&quot;&gt;investment
bankers&lt;/a&gt;
having to put in 80 hour weeks or 100 hour weeks or how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-did-Elon-Musk-work-for-100-hours-a-week-for-more-than-15-years&quot;&gt;Elon Musk did that for
years on
end&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s fascinating to me that someone would actually spend so much time working
and still enjoy it. Burn out seems unavoidable, and I have read several articles
about how it’s going to come and you should embrace it rather than trying to
fight against it happening or making it go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about all of this because for the past 5-6 days I have been
having 16 hour days, I have been awake from 7 AM to literally 1 or 2 AM every
single day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-54-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time that I posted to this blog under #100DaysOfWriting is perhaps the best
metric for when I was just about to go to sleep (on most of these days I didn’t
go to sleep right after, but instead hung out on the internet for still some
more time and then finally slept around 2 am in the morning!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is the BTP Final evaluation. Wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 53 - United Airlines mess, Prep post for the detailed one, Homeland finale (preview)</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/11/day-53"/>
   <updated>2017-04-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/11/day-53</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ah, the United situation is such a total mess. I have been hanging out at Reddit
and learning and absorbing so much information the past whole day (my first
complete day with Reddit since a hiatus, which I am not sure why I took), I hope
to make like a compilation of &lt;em&gt;what to do when asked to leave a plane?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short answer: &lt;strong&gt;Leave the plane.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long answer will have all sorts of links to comment threads that share a lot
of information about what it really means when revenue passengers are asked to
leave the plane, why airlines do it, how they approach it, how systematic it is
(they have software that will pick out people randomly, and it’s not really
truly random in the right sense of that concept, it’s more of a priority based
selection algorithm), and finally, &lt;em&gt;WHY is it necessary?&lt;/em&gt;. Why should people who
have austensibly promised a ticket on that flight be asked to leave a plane?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is all in the context of FAA and flying in the US etc, but I am
sure that airlines all around the world operate more or less the same way
because the airline industry is perhaps one of those industries where standards
are borrowed across countries because that makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A precursor and probably a prep post for my long post on the issue would contain
these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/64jli5/ama_request_the_doctor_dragged_off_the_overbooked/dg2vbjn/&quot;&gt;The dominos must keep falling in
place&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/64jli5/ama_request_the_doctor_dragged_off_the_overbooked/dg2undf/&quot;&gt;They have software to select who gets asked to leave, it’s not
random&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/64jli5/ama_request_the_doctor_dragged_off_the_overbooked/dg3kh1z/&quot;&gt;Checked-in luggage? You &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be
safer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/64lun9/who_gets_booted_first_due_to_airline_overbooking/&quot;&gt;Detailed airline Contract of Carriage review by
u/brndnb08&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/64jli5/ama_request_the_doctor_dragged_off_the_overbooked/dg2wazf/&quot;&gt;More discussion on what is loyalty for airlines and how each one tries to
quantify
it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it has left me with a much greater understanding of what to do in
situations like these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/64jli5/ama_request_the_doctor_dragged_off_the_overbooked/dg2wj4m/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once the police are involved, stay the hell out of it. Take videos, make
complaints, but do it all after the fact.
Same goes for your own interactions with police. When the cop is about to beat
your ass, you shouldn’t start screaming that you know your rights. Save that for
after the beating ends or else the beating may not end as soon as you would
like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those comments was a major hit, my observation that most people who fly
only 10-12 times a year try to get the cheapest flight and the only people who
wouldn’t fall in the category “people who booked the cheapest flight they could
get” would be people travelling for business who are jetting around the world
and the country all the time! (My Reddit comment karma just crossed 600!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think the above list should be enough for me to construct a good post
about this. The fact that complex systems like airlines work, has been a
fascination for me. They have huge machines going around the world, and each of
those machines has millions of small parts any of which could go wrong at any
airport anywhere in the world, and they have to deal with the next 400 people
who are dealing with their own crises and will have a myriad reasons for wanting
to get to their destination in time! It’s incredibly complex, and I am glad they
get it right as much as they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What United did with this particular incident, was HORRIBLE. It was a barbaric
act, they could have done a lot of things differently. I don’t know anything
about how these situations are normally handled, but in any case, there’s &lt;strong&gt;NO
JUSTIFICATION FOR DRAGGING A MAN SCREAMING OUT OF A PLANE&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/64jp6n/dont_forget_united_also_breaks_guitars/dg3fbgq/&quot;&gt;The Internet
agrees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, more has been said and written about r/place. The latest at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://sudoscript.com/reddit-place/&quot;&gt;sudoscript.com&lt;/a&gt;, I haven’t read the
article but I have been told that it’s a great article and I intend to read it
eventually. I need to be done with my Bachelors Thesis final presentation before
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 days to go now. About 33 hours, to be precise. I finally completed the LaTeX
part of the report today. A few final touches will make it print ready. Create a
Presentation after that, prepare for the presentation, and present Thursday
morning! There’s enough time to do all of that, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma is still stalled, right where I left it. I have not been able to read one
more page of it with all this time spent on reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And apart from hogging most of my blog space, my time on Reddit also ensured
that I have also not been able to talk about Homeland! I saw the Season 6 finale
today. IT BLEW MY MIND. I know I have been raving about Homeland a lot lately,
but that’s because this season has been like a home-coming of sorts. The
episodes have been crispier, each character has more depth, every character pops
out of the woods and shows us a side of theirs that no one else knew existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I debated writing spoilers in this post, it’s far too early to be honest and I
don’t want to write anyway. Eventually, I will write a post about the Finale,
one of these days I am going to be struggling for content anyway and then, this
will be an easy one to write about!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to call it there, this post has actually run far longer than I
intended it to. It’s 1:21 AM now.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 52 - A Hexahedral mesh in Ansys; Reddit Android clients comparison</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/10/day-52"/>
   <updated>2017-04-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/10/day-52</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was almost like yesterday, continued. More LaTex editing, more Ansys
simulations inside Static Structural. It’s been so long since I saw YouTube
tutorials for things (I think the last thing I saw them was for figuring out how
Python’s IDLE worked! That was 5 years ago, I guess. I had no clue about what
a Python shell was.) It’s surprising how easy it is to find Ansys tutorials. It
probably tells people that it’s an insanely complex software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure it’s for good reason, but couldn’t it be made just a little bit
easier? All I wanted was a fine hexahedral mesh. I had to watch 3 tutorials to
figure it out, and it was actually a very simply fix. I got pulled into
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MultiZone&lt;/code&gt; meshing, and so on. I was able to figure it out, eventually though.
And once I did, the stress distribution didn’t change as much as I thought it
would. It changed a bit, I guess. I haven’t had the time to even look at the
results properly yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is also the reason I haven’t seen Homeland’s 6.12, Season 6 finale episode
yet! I know it’s out, I don’t follow anyone who might give me spoilers about it,
I read this one tweet that I am sure I will forget by tomorrow. I have stayed
off of Twitter for this reason, I am bound to come up on a Gif made from the
episode sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That also gives me a good chance to get on Reddit, but I didn’t realise that
unlike Twitter which provides a feed that is impossible to get to the bottom of,
Reddit’s feed is static until you refresh it. So, it’s like an article that’s
constantly changing in the background but you can’t feel it at all. There are no
obvious markers anywhere on any subreddit or any reddit android app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried a bunch of those today. I was using the Reddit official Android
application for the past 3 days, and it was &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;. There wasn’t anything crazy
about it, it was definitely not as good as Relay at the speed that it was
loading things at or in the intuitiveness of Reddit’s comment threads. Comment
threads are some of the weirdest and hardest understand features on Reddit with
things like “context”, “show parent” and “mark as read”. Every comment reply
gets added as an unread message, it’s very confusing to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubenmayayo.reddit&quot;&gt;Boost for
Reddit&lt;/a&gt;
which is another Reddit android client. I was liking it until I realised (about
3 minutes in) that when I am looking at reply 3 to my comment, I can’t see reply
1 or reply 2. The only way to do that is to go to the complete comments thread
and then manually scroll down and find my comment somewhere and then dig into
the replies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Relay for Reddit has the nifty “MINE” feature which lets me switch
back and forth between the comments that I posted. This feature is probably the
one that I use the most because always, after understanding a story and reading
all the material, once I start discussing it’s only my comments and the replies
to them and my replies to those replies that matter. Everything else is just
background noise that I will catch up on &lt;strong&gt;later&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a blatant plug for &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=free.reddit.news&quot;&gt;Relay for
Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. I was
around when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&quot;&gt;Reddit &lt;em&gt;official android
app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was
first released and they changed their API and barred everyone else from using
the Reddit icon in their client icons. It was all very aggresive and all, but
Relay is clearly still the better one amongst the two!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 51 - Writing tex, music I heard through the day, r/BigLittleLies and bad critics</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/09/day-51"/>
   <updated>2017-04-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/09/day-51</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent most of today staring at a tex document inside vim. I was listening to
some different kind of music throughout the day actually. I started with RHCP’s
Stadium Arcadium. Specifically, the three songs Stadium Arcadium, Hey and Snow.
I LOVE Hey. “HEY, Oh yeah, How long?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I switched over to The Neighbourhood’s #icanteven, which is a nice upbeat
rap included song. The beat is really good to get you out of sleep and really
concentrate on the text on your screen. Or anything else, really. Now, I am
listening to Arctic Monkeys. I somehow always end up listening to them. Either
AM or Favourite Worst Nightmare or Suck It and See. One of those three albums.
Their whole discography has so much &lt;em&gt;variety&lt;/em&gt; and the song sequences of the
whole album are set in my mind so I know what’s coming before the song plays.
It’s a great feeling, knowing what song is going to play next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While AM and RHCP are pretty popular, I always got the feeling that The
Neighbourhood didn’t get as famous as they should have for all their songs
except the smash hit Sweater Weather. While I love that song, the top 10 songs
on their Spotify page are all good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-51-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweater Weather has an incredible 212 Million plays, but it’s really surprising
that people didn’t click through the artist and come to this page and play their
other songs. One track minds for almost everyone out there, I guess. Anyway, I
am glad I went to their artist page and heard their other songs and one of their
albums. If you are reading this, and haven’t heard the songs in the above
screenshot, go right ahead and listen to them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I contemplated writing a post about the music I like going in a
chronological order, starting somewhere in the 80s but it was too great a
project and I would inevitably miss someone or the other out. Even when I was
trying to make a list in my head for myself, I was missing out on a lot of
artists that I like and listen to very often, like Ed Sheeran, no less!! I will
do it some day soon, maybe after Thursday’s Bachelor’s thesis presentation.
There should be enough time for that and other such ambitious projects then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Little Lies ended last Monday. I was disappointed about the things they
changed from the books, other than that I was glad about the binocular scene at
the end and the zippo closing shut, it was probably the woman detective who was
doing that. I posted a link to r/BigLittleLies about Season 2 and that link
earned me my first Link karma, and about 20 more after that! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/biglittlelies/comments/63yxd4/season_2_might_happen_says_author_witherspoon/dfy2zca/&quot;&gt;I didn’t realise
that I would miss Perry this much
though&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another link that was posted on this subreddit was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/biglittlelies/comments/649kby/why_are_male_critics_so_baffled_by_big_little_lies/&quot;&gt;this thread about how male
reviewers didn’t understand
BLL&lt;/a&gt;.
I read the criticism of the reviews, and then I read the reviews themselves, and
I found them to have grossly overlooked the complete show. In fact, the most
startling comment in the NY Post review was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Instead, we’re subjected to scenes of the S&amp;amp;M sex games played by Celeste and
her husband, Perry (a one-dimensional Alexander Skarsgard)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even the most distracted viewer of ALL 5 episodes of the show, as the author
claims to be, would refer to Perry’s abuse of Celeste as S&amp;amp;M games. To pass
comments on a show without even seeing it properly, when it’s your JOB. How do
these critics get away with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read both reviews through and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/biglittlelies/comments/649kby/why_are_male_critics_so_baffled_by_big_little_lies/dg1fp1n/&quot;&gt;noted down all the gross
mistakes&lt;/a&gt;
in those reviews. I won’t call them mistakes because they weren’t
mis-understandings of the show, they were presumptions from having watched the
show for 5 minutes and then trying to pass judgement on the show. Incredibly
short sighted authors and reviewers: Mike Hale and Robert Rorke. I wish they
would up their game and write a respectable review that actually HIT the things
that were bad with this show, if they could find anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I noticed that many articles were asking for a season 2 just so we could
have another stellar soundtrack. Season 1 had some of the best BGM in the show,
probably after Westworld and Game of Thrones, this is one of the most memorable
soundtracks. Although, most of the songs were not originals composed for this
show, they fit the situation perfectly in every case and that’s what I care
about!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 50 - HALF WAY MARK, tweets_analyzer repository</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/08/day-50"/>
   <updated>2017-04-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/08/day-50</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;HALF WAY THERE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been writing a daily blog post for the past 50 days. A lot happened and
through that time, and I will probably write a summary of all of it once I am
totally done with the #100DaysOfWriting challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/x0rz/tweets_analyzer&quot;&gt;x0rz/tweets_analyser&lt;/a&gt;
repository using a Twitter API key and I must say that the data that it threw
out was very very fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I first analyzed my Twitter account: @_icyflame&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the timings that I have tweeted in most over the past 1000 tweets (in 372
days or there abouts), I have NEVER tweeted between 3 am - 4 am and between 5 am
and 7 am. I would have believed that I would have probably tweeted at all times
of day atleast by now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-50-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The break up for different week days wasn’t interesting. The distribution was
almost uniform throughout the week. I had only one Geotagged tweet and that was
from Kharagpur! So, I think I am doing pretty well there, security wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most used Hashtags was surprising though. I would have definitely thought it
should have been Homeland, but it was GameOfThrones by a narrow single
occurence!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-50-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atleast @SHO_Homeland was my most mentioned user. That amounts to some
redemption. I do love Homeland much much more than I love the 6th season of GoT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, the domains of the URLs that I keep tweeting. Most of them are
goodreads, considering that all of my activity gets mirrored here this is not
surprising. After Goodreads, the common ones are my blog’s domain, Youtube and
github.com. None of that is surprising in the least!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-50-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on to analyse @dhh, @CaseyNeistat, @MKBHD, @eevee. All of these accounts
are very active accounts. Their last 1000 tweets came in at the last 72,
128, 85, and 14 days. There’s a lot of insight to be gained about sleep cycles
and the people they follow and are closely connected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great tool! I have wanted to build something of this sort for git for
so long now. I think I already said this in an earlier post here, but I do
really want to build this. (In one of Linus Torvalds’ interviews, he said that
he ran some analyses and found that most kernel developers now work between
standard times like 9-6. I don’t know how he found that out, but it probably
took him a few minutes to write the whole thing in C or bash(?). I have a
feeling he didn’t use a wrapper like Grub or git-ruby to write that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also stumbled onto &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/63sgik/rplace_and_the_implications_to_sociology/&quot;&gt;this
discussion&lt;/a&gt; 
on r/sociology about the latest r/place
experiment. I think this is the right place to get more insight on what really
happened there and what all people could read from it! I saw the Timelapse
video. It game me some perspective over the HUGENESS of the canvas and there
were so many thing going on at the same time that it was very hard to follow
through manually. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/63sgik/rplace_and_the_implications_to_sociology/dg07d3z/&quot;&gt;wrote
down&lt;/a&gt;
what I thought about some of the major battles that I could notice after
watching the timelapse a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 49 - Western Groups in the wee hours, MFQP PR 30, Homeland finale</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/07/day-49"/>
   <updated>2017-04-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/07/day-49</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is going to be an interesting day. My day isn’t over yet, not in theory
anyway. The Western Groups Interhall event is going to happen in about 4
hours(?) from now. There’s no way to know when it would happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally opened &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/metakgp/mfqp/pull/30&quot;&gt;PR #30: Add ability to pre-fill the search bar from URL
param&lt;/a&gt;. This particular change has been
on my fork of this repository for quite a long time. It should find it’s way
into the repository’s master branch soon. The most important functionality that
it would add to MFQP would be the addition of mfqp as a search engine in Chrome!
So, typing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mfqp TAB query ENTER&lt;/code&gt; should complete the search. Earlier, the
process was to go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://qp.metakgp.org&quot;&gt;https:\/\/qp.metakgp.org&lt;/a&gt; and then
type the query into the search box manually. This would make using MFQP slightly
more pleasant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Homeland season finale is going to drop on Sunday! I am so excited about
that, especially because of all the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; plot points that were introduced in
6.11. Rupert Friend has been doing the rounds on all the morning shows and the
late night shows promoting and answering questions about Homeland and this is
the first time that he has started levitating towards the lead actor Emmy and
&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the supporting actor Emmy which he was nominated for once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other names being thrown up are Sterling Brown’s Chris Darden from People
vs. O J Simpson and Reese Witherspoon’s Madeline from beloved BigLittleLies! All
three played complex characters and unfortunately, I am too biased towards
Claire Danes to support anyone except Rupert Friend, but I think they might all
have a good chance! (And there will obviously be people from TV series that I
haven’t watched, right? RIGHT?) The Emmys are in September this year which is an
incredibly long way off, so everything right now is too early anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I haven’t made any progress with Emma ever since. I have started
working on my final Bachelors thesis report now. It’s a latex document that’s
already been prepared, template / fonts / external packages wise. I just need to
write stuff and then run the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;build.sh&lt;/code&gt; script. I have a similar setup for all
my Latex projects. This script takes care of annoying stuff like the deletion of
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;log&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aux&lt;/code&gt; files that are created when a TEX file is built with
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xelatex&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I removed gnome-keyring yesterday, things are still fine. The password entry
from inside the terminal isn’t too annoying at all! And I use GPG so rarely that
it doesn’t matter anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 48 - Updating my RSA keys to 4096 bit after reading Gert's article</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/06/day-48"/>
   <updated>2017-04-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/06/day-48</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.g3rt.nl/upgrade-your-ssh-keys.html&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;
yesterday, which urges everyone to move from RSA to Ed25519, EC-based public
keys. Totally legit article, and covers all possible corner cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was using 2048 bits RSA keys till now, I have updated them to a 4096 bit key
now. An Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server refuses to accept Ed25519 keys. When specifying
the pubkey protocols that it understands, it says &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rsa, 535, blen&lt;/code&gt; and one other
suite. The OpenSSH version is 6.6, and the post says that anything about 6.5
should support Ed25519 keys. I need to investigate this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a sherr size difference in the RSA keys and the Ed25519 keys. Although
both afford the same amount of security, the Edwards Curve keys are much much
smaller in size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 4096 RSA keypair is 4184 B long. The private key is by far the larger file.
Now, come to the Edwards CUrve and a whopping 10-fold decrease. The keypair is
570 B long, yes, that’s both the public key and the private key!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although support for Ed25519 is patchy right now, I am sure they will take care
of this in the future versions of OpenSSH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One slight issue that I ran into was when I removed the old RSA key from the
server and tried logging in with the brand new 4096 bit RSA key, it said
“sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed: agent refused operation”. This was
because the SSH Agent (which was GNOME Keyring in my case, a default Ubuntu
installation) was refusing to sign this 4096 bit RSA key. A quick &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get
remove --purge gnome-keyring&lt;/code&gt; and system restart removed that completely, and
now the agent is nothing fancy and asks for password from within the terminal
itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am obviously holding on to my old key just yet, it will probably take a long
time before I can delete those files having completely switched to 4096 bit
keys. Probably, not even then, there &lt;em&gt;just might&lt;/em&gt; be an esoteric old and long
forgotten computer with Ubuntu installed on it, where the legacy keys are added.
There’s no harm in keeping the legacy keys as long as you are not going to (even
accidentally) add them to a production server.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 47 - Updated About page after 2 years,  Homeland 6.11 complicates the TV show more</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/05/day-47"/>
   <updated>2017-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/05/day-47</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I updated my About page. I should have done that a long time ago, I last updated
that page on March 31, 2015. That’s two years and 1 week before today! A HUGE
amount of time in which my outlook about a lot of things has changed. I glanced
at the diff again and I noticed the change in the tone of the text in that page.
Having written history to compare yourself to past selves is an interesting
experience, sometimes my past naivete intrigues me in the same way that
understanding &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; learning something, it’s hard to imagine a time when
didn’t know that thing. I am pretty sure that whole situation is called
something, I don’t know what the search term should be though, so I am going to
let it go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AH! I saw Homeland’s 6.11 episode. It created some new troubles for Carrie and Quinn and ended
&lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; with a bang. Apparently, Claire Danes said over the past few days when she’s been doing the
rounds talking about the season finale that the finale will leave the viewers happy. At this stage,
I have absolutely no clue how they can make anything happy, almost everyone is in a bad place except
for Saul and Keane who are slowly understanding the situation that they have landed themselves
in. Max is stuck, Carrie and Quinn are too, O’Keefe has some weird pull over audiences and cleverly
edits sound and video to make it sound like he is being villified. It’s a HUGE MESS, and they need
another season &lt;em&gt;JUST&lt;/em&gt; to explain the stuff that’s been going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/849563532500795393&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2017-04-05-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this season was mostly about Quinn and most importantly, Quinnn’s past.
His staging house for Mid-East operations, Robert Knepper who appeared for only
two scenes in the whole show and has been missing ever since, the whole Dar Adal
play and what that end-game is, there are so many moving parts! The stage for
season 7 is beautifully set, unless they decide to shut everything down in the
finale. That’s probably not going to happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Little Lies finale dropped as well. A one-hour episode to cover all the
ground that was left uncovered till episode 6, this could have easily been a 10
episode mini series. Obviously, I just want to increase the number of episodes
because I really liked the book and would like to see an unhasty conclusion to
the show with Perry and all! (Alexander Skarsgard does such a great job playing
that character, he’s 7 feet tall and his scenes with the twins are the BEST!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t seen the episode yet, I hope they did justice to the explosive finale
that I am looking forward to. Scenes at the end of 1.6 showed that the setup for
the climax is the same as that in the books.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 46 - Re-watching Seinfeld on Amazon Prime - The Stall and The Stake-Out</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/04/day-46"/>
   <updated>2017-04-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/04/day-46</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I set a goal to read 40 books this year on Goodreads at the start of this year.
Last year, I read 30 and I did that pretty peacefully (December was totally free
and I crammed about 5 more to go over the goal to 35). Now, I am “on track”,
which means that if I don’t finish the book this week (week 14 of the year) then
I will be “behind the schedule”. THAT is going to happen. This sounds so much
like the iconic Taken scene:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wcjY-VN8_l4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a completely new take to action cinema, the hero always used to RUN for
the person being kidnapped, reach there on time, or after. Then, fight everyone
there to escape, this was Liam Neeson accepting that she &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be taken and
that he would then go and find her! I was &lt;em&gt;taken&lt;/em&gt; the first time I saw that
scene. ( &lt;em&gt;WINK, WINK&lt;/em&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched the Amazon Prime Comedy specials of Naveen Richards and Varun Thakur,
I am in the trial period though, so this is going to end. A gem that I did find
while browsing Prime Video was Seinfeld with HINDI subtitles! When I turned them
on and followed them along, I realised that they were really accurate! I wonder
who had that job at Amazon: write Hindi subtitles for the greatest comedy show
ever! And Kramer’s dialogues in Hindi? The next thing I am going to do after
writing and posting this post will be to check out the episode “The Stall” with
Hindi subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly, The Stall has an exchange between Kramer and Seinfeld that starts
with Kramer saying “AM I? OR AM I SO …” That scene got overshadowed by the
other main premise of that episode which is the thing between Elaine and Jerry’s
girlfriend and the voice of Erica / Jerry’s girlfriend being tattooed on both
Elaine and Kramer’s brain for radically different reasons. Anyway, it’s a great
episode and worth watching twice or a 100 times if time would allow it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I noticed while watching Episode 1.2 The Stake Out was the
scene in which Elaine’s friend at Pamela’s birthday party, whose law firm George
and Jerry stake-out. When that friend leaves, all the men at the table follow
her along until she reaches the door! On my first time watching this scene, I
was only looking at Jerry and the women going out the door and her boyfriend,
the other men were totally out of focus to me. THIS is the pleasure of
rewatching a great show!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 45 - r/place shuts down after 72 hours, WHY was it created?, Emma is an ENIGMA</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/03/day-45"/>
   <updated>2017-04-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/03/day-45</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t know about &lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/r/place&quot;&gt;r/place&lt;/a&gt;, I will give you
a lowdown on it. It first started as an empty canvas apparently. When I went to
it, there was a lot of pixel art there already. Anyone can place a pixel
anywhere, with one catch: you can only place a pixel once every 10 (later 5)
minutes. &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/2fJ0fQa.png&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is how the canvas looked at the
very end, about a couple hours ago when &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;r/place&lt;/code&gt; crashed and the whole project
was ended. Initially, I thought this was a social experiment to prove that there
are more constructive art-makers on reddit than there are trolls who only want
to destroy everything good and honest. Was it, though? I couldn’t find the first
post on that subreddit, which I am somehow convinced would have consisted of
&lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; rational of building this thing. I will keep trying to find out why this
thing stayed alive for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/6382bb/place_has_ended/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=place&quot;&gt;72
hours&lt;/a&gt;
and then just stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be safe to say that people did indeed come together and made something
great starting from an &lt;a href=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8Q3UXRXYAAF20P.jpg&quot;&gt;empty
canvas&lt;/a&gt; spewed with NSFW
messages to the final form of the canvas which had a lot of flags, the GNU/Linux
penguin, Counter Strike logo, Tesla logo and SO much other art that &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt;
created by one person. This was a fun thing that was around for three days and I
got to experience it in real time! And &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in retrospect. There have been so
many 2-3 day trends that I have missed out on simply because I was tuned out and
doing something else and was late to the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inched a little bit further in Emma, finally she starts to “get” Elton! Harriet
is soooo being taken for a ride! But there is this particularly fascinating and
disturbing paragraph. Emma is daydreaming about Frank Churchill, who is a
mysterious character who’s never been seen by anyone in Hartfield, and herself
being seen as a couple in everyone’s eyes and RIGHT AFTER that, Weston (Miss
Taylor’s husband) calls her up and tells her that he thinks Frank and Harriet
would make a perfect match and she doesn’t bat an eyelid before answering! Not
even in her inner monologue! HOW?! This is disturbing because this is weird
behaviour, if you are daydreaming about someone and their parents want you to
arrange a match for them with a friend of yours, what would your reaction be?
(This is totally only going to happen in a late 18th century book where you call
your father Sir and all the conversation is painfully formal and to the point
and asking after other people obediently because that’s what you do.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma Woodhouse is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma&quot;&gt;ENIGMA&lt;/a&gt;. Frank
Churchill is also an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma&quot;&gt;ENIGMA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 44 - Learning vim, installing plugins and spending time on tooling</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/02/day-44"/>
   <updated>2017-04-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/02/day-44</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, yesterday I wrote a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/blog/commit/1ce1137165731900a75b80545702c5568903efd8#diff-145d68ed88381f394a06584ba0c7522b&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/blog/blob/1ce1137165731900a75b80545702c5568903efd8/next-post.sh&quot;&gt;of
scripts&lt;/a&gt;. These are mainly to make the counting of the posts easier.
Till now, in the month of march the post number was simply the date + 11, but
now and going forward it will be pretty hard to keep track of this number and at
the same time save a few keystrokes in opening the editor and typing the number
in, removing the TODO tags from &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icyflame/blog/1ce1137165731900a75b80545702c5568903efd8/public/templates/100daysofwriting-template.md&quot;&gt;the
template&lt;/a&gt;.
Anyway, the ruby script was fun to implement. It probably doesn’t need to be
this big(?), I just wanted to be sure that I would get the right date for the
post on the first attempt itself and I won’t have to edit the name or something
like that. &lt;strong&gt;You should keep working on tooling, until you feel good about
everything that you have (which will never really happen)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the approach I took to vim, I used to use Sublime Text full time
until I decided to switch to vim. For the longest time (about 3 months), I used
vim with absolutely vanilla settings, I spent &lt;em&gt;no time at all&lt;/em&gt; on setting up my
preferred keyboard shortcuts or installing plugins even though the vim plugin
ecosystem was something everyone raved about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But eventually, I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimawesome.com/&quot;&gt;vimawesome&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very
pretty catalogue of all the plugins that are available for vim. I installed
Vundle, then I installed each of the plugins that I now have. I think
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nerdcommenter&lt;/code&gt; is a plugin that I really needed but couldn’t figure out how to
work for about a month, but then I scoured the readme, tried different key
combinations and &lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt; I finally understood the readme. The fault was all
mine really, I had no clue what the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;leader&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; meant back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some other plugins that came and went away quickly, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NerdFileTree&lt;/code&gt;
was one of them, although I liked that, it couldn’t &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;compete&lt;/strong&gt; with the
convenience and the sheer power of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CtrlP&lt;/code&gt;. CtrlP is my second favourite vim
plugin, and it’s also there everywhere else, any IDE, any text editor. A lot of
people surprisingly don’t know about this particular functionality and spend
quite a bit of time going around in their terminal or &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; time
navigating around Nautilus. &lt;strong&gt;CtrlP exists: USE IT, you will LOVE IT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right after those two plugins, I am going to put
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim-system-copy&lt;/code&gt; which I installed very very recently and
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim-multiple-cursors&lt;/code&gt; which again is a plugin that’s been installed for quite
some time, but I learned to use properly only a few months ago. Both these
plugins have made life even more easy for me! (Especially inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; where
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tmux-yank&lt;/code&gt; plugin has to be used to copy text. Yeah, unnecessary
complexity, I am sure there’s a good reason for that to be the case.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syntax highlighting, vertical and horizontal splitting of the screen into panes
and all that common editor stuff is cool. TL; DR Spend a weekend getting vim to
do what you want an editor to do for you, spend another weekend’s worth of time
doing full time work with vim even if it is slow and painful as hell and
requires a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com&quot;&gt;searches&lt;/a&gt; in the browser, DO IT.
Eventually, it will all be muscle memory and you will have picked up the amazing
skill of being at ease no matter what computer is thrown at you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually wrote a lot of the above paragraphs in a cover letter that I
submitted for an internship position at Basecamp, for Summer 2017. I didn’t get
in, I did get a phone interview with Noah Lorang (who happens to be the Data
team head. WHAT?!) and I wonder if the person who was screening the cover
letters was influenced by the couple sentences I wrote about how vim made me all
powerful when I sat down at a new computer or ssh-ed into a droplet somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also had the pleasure / discomfort of using vanilla vim forcefully, I
always keep a basic vim configuration handy at &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/icyflame/2411178c028a074f47ca6e86623334cf/raw/&quot;&gt;this
gist&lt;/a&gt;,
who’s short URL is stored on my phone as a contact. You are probably thinking
that this is too convoluted, but it’s a really convenient setup. (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wget short-url&lt;/code&gt; when on a new computer)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 43 - MISSED; Clock issues on Windows-Ubuntu Dual Boot</title>
   <link href="/2017/04/01/day-43"/>
   <updated>2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/04/01/day-43</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ah, this is going to be my sixth MISSED post. The irony of it all is that
yesterday, I really had a topic to write about. A topic that a friend asked me
about earlier in the day and one that I have faced many times myself. Uh, irony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing your Clock on Windows-Ubuntu Dual Boot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching over to Windows and seeing the wrong time or switching to Ubuntu and
seeing the wrong time, it’s all pretty irritating. It keeps happening, there’s
no easy way to fix that, this is my recipe. It’s pretty easy, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off the &lt;em&gt;Update time from Internet&lt;/em&gt; option on all your operating systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boot into Windows, and open the registry editor. (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WinKey + R&lt;/code&gt; followed by
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;regedit&lt;/code&gt; in the text box)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edit this key:
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right-click in the right-side panel and select New &amp;gt; DWORD Value. Create the 
 key named &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RealTimeIsUniversal&lt;/code&gt; and give it a value of 1.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now, restart your computer and boot into Ubuntu. We will set the Hardware
clock to UTC time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open a terminal, &lt;strong&gt;you need root privileges on your machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let’s start with the basics. Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo hwclock --show&lt;/code&gt;, this should show you
the current time that’s stored in your hardware clock&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set this to the current UTC which should be available to you through your
phone or the Internet. (Read further to see how to do this from a great GUI)
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hwclock&lt;/code&gt; supports the GREAT feature of copying over time from the system&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;So, open the calendar / date-time GUI application and set the proper time
there.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure automatic updation of the time from the internet is turned off&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Once you have set the proper time for your timezone in the window, you can
run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo hwclock --systohc&lt;/code&gt;. This will copy over the current system time
to the hardware clock.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You should also probably run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo hwclock --utc&lt;/code&gt; to make sure that the
hardware clock is kept in UTC&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the file &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/default/rcS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UTC=yes&lt;/code&gt; to that file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are SET now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide serves as an enhancement to the two pages that I have in my bookmarks
bar under the folder &lt;em&gt;Clock issues&lt;/em&gt; (Yeah, right, that’s how big a problem this
was)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mikebeach.org/2011/04/10/windows-linux-dual-boot-system-time-issues/&quot;&gt;Windows-Linux Dual Boot System Issues on mikebeach.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/08/hwclock-examples/&quot;&gt;Examples of using hwclock on thegeekstuff.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the end of my tutorial for the most part, a couple of quick points about
this setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem here is that Linux interprets the Hardware clock to be set in
UTC whereas Windows assumes it to be in Local time by default, this creates the
initial inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automatica time updation from the internet probably changes the hardware clock
right after startup and right before shutdown instead of changing it once? I
don’t know anything about this, but I have a feeling that this also works
differently in both operating systems. Simply turning it off and adjusting for
the drift of the hardware clock every year or something as infrequent as that
will ensure that the setup is simple! (This also enables freely changing the
timezone on whichever operating system, that should not affect the hardware
clock at all)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 42 - Taping your webcam, open ports, the WHY of it all</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/31/day-42"/>
   <updated>2017-03-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/31/day-42</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have thought long and hard about the topic that I plan to write on today,
Privacy. I taped my laptop’s webcam about 2 weeks ago, it afforded a renewed
notion of &lt;em&gt;security&lt;/em&gt;, for the past 2 years, I have had it obscured because the
lid of my laptop is mostly closed. But now, I am all in. When I think about the
&lt;em&gt;doors&lt;/em&gt; that I have left open for attackers, I want to be sure that there’s
nothing obviously wrong that I am doing. Before my &lt;a href=&quot;https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/writing/ubuntu/installation/2017/03/04/day-15/&quot;&gt;recent Ubuntu
re-install&lt;/a&gt;,
I had the package &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openssh-server&lt;/code&gt; installed on my primary computer! YEAH. Port
22 was open, it was behind a router and I used it to connect to my computer
through my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me say that again: I had an RSA private key on my phone
that could be used to get into my computer. Obviously, I didn’t know how
insanely dangerous and stupid of my it was to have this kind of a setup, but I
used to have that, and now I don’t. That’s partly because of all the articles
that I read online about privacy and &lt;em&gt;really important&lt;/em&gt; people’s email getting
leaked or copied or hacked into or stolen, and partly because I finally
understand how &lt;strong&gt;easy&lt;/strong&gt; it is for someone to mount an attack, all it takes is a
bit of social engineering (talk to the victim, get some details out of them,
have access to their phone in an &lt;em&gt;unlocked&lt;/em&gt; state for a short period of time)
and the determination to want to get in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I think I should mention Robert Heaton’s post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://robertheaton.com/2014/12/08/fun-with-your-friends-facebook-and-tinder-session-tokens/&quot;&gt;cloning
Facebook sessions using the Chrome extension
EditThisCookie&lt;/a&gt;,
which I tried myself with an incognito browser and my &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; session and IT
WORKED! A running ratchet that would change the session key for encryption every
few minutes sounds like something that Facebook should have implemented? It all
sounds really shady to me, because there were literally two steps to the whole
process: 1. Install the extension 2. Copy the cookies and send them to yourself.
The whole process would take about 5-9 minutes on a decent Internet connection
with a good mouse and keyboard, assuming a logged in email account which is
totally legit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the Snowden leaks, NSA &lt;em&gt;apparently&lt;/em&gt; being able to switch on webcams
without turning on the indicator lights on many versions and the Black Mirror
S03E03 were all powerful contributing factors. (Mr. Robot didn’t have any
privacy specific implications yet, but the next season might? should? We will
see!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. See that black mirror episode if you haven’t already! The show was taken
over by Netflix for the third season, and the production has changed and the
difference between British production and Netflix production is rather visible!
Nonetheless, all seasons of that show are GREAT.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 41 - MISSED; Progress with Emma; Comparison with Aisha;</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/30/day-41"/>
   <updated>2017-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/30/day-41</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ah, finally, I made some &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; progress with Emma (Austen). The characters
are realy panning out, this book is far easier to read than I would have thought
of, she writes in a simple style, and there are a few complex sentences here and
there, but most of them are conversational and easy to understand!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learnt some archaic spellings that I believed were typos, hilariously. &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt;
was spelled &lt;em&gt;chuse&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; was spelled &lt;em&gt;shew&lt;/em&gt;. Very very surprising!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am almost immediately reminded of this movie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1509732/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-41-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2010 Hindi movie with Sonam Kapoor as Aisha and Abhay Deol and some other good
actors. Aisha is definitely inspired from Emma, she’s rich, good looking,
doesn’t want to get married and has a father who indulges every one of her
insane plans about the new girl that she befriends and is determined to match
with a friend of hers from her own social circle, while that girl is in love
with some other boy from her &lt;em&gt;life before Aisha&lt;/em&gt;. It’s an &lt;em&gt;OKAY&lt;/em&gt; movie, one of
the songs is really good, and it’s an over-all not too heavy, chilled out
account of a rich, young girl’s life. I wonder if this novel was credited in
that movie. Although this kind of a story is quite common and it doesn’t need an
Austen to tell us about it, the specific circumstances are too similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ages of most characters have been revealed now. Knightley is 37-38, Elton is
27 and Harriet is not even 18 yet. Emma’s age hasn’t come up just yet, but I
guess she would be in her twenties because she is definitely older than Harriet
and Elton’s admiration (love?) for her suggests that she might be his
contemporary. Knightley is the voice of reason in the book, that’s Abhay Deol
character’s in the movie. At the end movie-Aisha and movie-Abhay Deol get
toether and get married or something, I wonder if that’s even &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; with
this book. Just have to wait and see what is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also watched the finale of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6205862/?ref_=nv_sr_1&quot;&gt;People v. O J
Simpson&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t know the
outcome, I don’t want to spill any spoilers for the people who haven’t seen the
live news coverage or the show yet. I can’t say anything about it because like
one masterful scene in the show where detective Mark Fuhrman is asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cochran: Did you falsify any evidence in this case?
Fuhrman: I assert my Fifth Amendment privilege&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a masterful stroke from Shapiro and Cochran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some more TV news, an Emmy for Rupert Friend is in the air? He had one
nomination in 2013, probably for the first season as Quinn where he was &lt;strong&gt;THE
BADASS TO BE&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, he has a much deeper role and is pulling it off INCREDIBLY
well! I wish he gets an Emmy! #EmmyForRupert&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started reading Emma (Austen) today! The comforts of a story being linearly
narrated are manifold, I missed that! (Both my previous books were confused
narrations which switched here and there and totally left me in
reading-epilepsy, I liked that too, it’s good to be back nonetheless) This story
is also written in late-18th century English with the whole flourish and the
Keira Knightley and Rosamund Pike-esque characters. Emma Woodhouse’ introduction
was solid, Mr. Knightley just entered the scene!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SsmVgoXDq2w&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(That applies to Tuesdays this semester)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, fun fact, &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of my previous posts have been really late, about 30
minutes before midnight or hours after midnight. I love Git for this extent of
statistics reporting that’s built into it. For the longest time I have wanted to
build some kind of analyser or a gem of some sort which will use a ruby wrapper
for the Git binary and show some kind of “cool” statistics about projects.
Specifically, I wanted to use it to find out how “active” an open source project
was: how many new people contribute each week, how many contributors &lt;em&gt;return&lt;/em&gt;
and contribute regularly, what kind of times do they work in between. I think
the last metric is especially important in finding out if a project is something
that the contributors do for work or pursue as personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could also be done for Github users on their public repositories to see
what type of code they are writing and what time they are writing it in. All of
this is great talk, but&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Talk is cheap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this still remains in the “ideation” phase and never made it into the real
world. I found this repository through &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.0day.rocks/you-will-be-surprised-by-what-your-tweets-may-reveal-about-you-and-your-habits-3bc907688bc8&quot;&gt;this
article&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/x0rz/tweets_analyzer&quot;&gt;x0rz/tweets_analyzer&lt;/a&gt;. Given a
username, it tries to find some stuff about the user, specifically it uses the
timezone, the times that the user often tweets in, the users that are most
interacted with and retweeted: this probably shows people that the user has
turned on notifications for (?) because it’s next to impossible to continuously
retweet someone unless you are pinged each time they tweet something. Twitter is
an incredibly hard platform to just stay focused on one thing, if you follow a
few 100 people and then you scroll down for about 2 minutes, your feed updates
with 4-5 tweets and the blue dot next to the “HOME” icon is hard to ignore and
just keep browsing. This is how FOMO works, yes? (Note to myself: I should add
FOMO to the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/awesome-social-science&quot;&gt;awesome-social-science&lt;/a&gt;
list that I maintain)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 39 - 8 BILLION passengers are carried every year by the Indian Railway. WHOA!</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/28/day-39"/>
   <updated>2017-03-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/28/day-39</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Okay, I can feel this being a short post. It’s just that I am in the phase
between two books where I haven’t committed to anything just yet. Emma (Austen)
is waiting to be picked up. That book is in the public domain, and the people at
Amazon are really nice to put it up on the Kindle store and save everyone the
trouble of having to download it and copy it over to the Kindle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting thing that I discovered today was the total number of passengers
that use the Indian Railway system each year. The number is HUGE. It’s HUGE,
it’s like nothing I would have imagined. Before seeing the figures, I made a
&lt;em&gt;rough&lt;/em&gt; estimate of maybe half the population of India which is about 600
million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual number was &lt;strong&gt;8 BILLION&lt;/strong&gt; passengers, per annum. Yeah, that’s 500
million more than the TOTAL POPULATION OF THE EARTH. It’s a NUMBER that I can
barely even make sense of, 8 times the population of India! (That number is the
number of passengers carried in rail transport in 1 year)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_rail_usage#Passengers_carried_in_rail_transport_per_year&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-39-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, two things come up here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan has 9 BILLION PASSENGERS carried each year. HUH? The population of
Japan is about 120 million. That’s 10 times less than India’s population.
Also, the total area of India is about 9-10 times more than Japan’s area. How
can the passengers carried be more? It’s extremely intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China has ONLY 1 Billion passengers each year. That’s barely more than their
own population, do the Chinese travel less? Or do they travel more by flights
and less by trains? In either case, this is surprising. I expected this trend
to directly reflect the population, I mean in absolute terms the population
would be expected to be the defining metric here!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite this, China happens to have the most passenger-kilometers product at
1196 billion. India follows at 1147 billion and then a STEEP drop to 260 billion
in Japan. So, every year Japan, more people are travelling but they are
travelling for shorter distances. Whereas in India a similar number of people
are travelling each year, but travelling GREAT distances. Whereas in China, very
few people are travelling by trains but they are travelling a GREAT amount of
distance. Naively, dividing these two numbers gives us an average of 1000 km
travelled by each passenger, assuming that every person in China travels a
similar amount of distance each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That number happens to be pretty close to the 770 passenger-km per capita that
India has. So, for every person in India, an Indian Railway passenger can travel
770 km. That metric doesn’t make sense to me, but it could be an interpretation
issue. (I am thinking of it as “man-hour” which might not be the right way to
think about things like this)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 38 - Completed Handmaid's Tale - A dystopia with great writing</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/27/day-38"/>
   <updated>2017-03-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/27/day-38</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finally, I got the 1 hour I needed to finish Handmaid’s Tale. A detailed review
is up on Goodreads:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1936753272&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing this, I got to thinking about whether I should compare this with
the other dystopias that I have read. The most influential of these was 1984
(Orwell). A
surveillance state with some horrible restrictions on everything and horrible
food for everyone who was not a proper Inner Government official. Gilead is a
different world, of course. There are stricter observations, but almost no
surveillance. Instead this is replaced by a complex heirarchial system among
women that ends up in all of them keeping a wary eye on each other for possible
signs of betrayal, laziness, non-adherance to the routine preset by the Wife of
the household, etc. There are many quote worthy lines in this book, mostly
platitudes but some really profound lines about life and controlling people and
keeping people in check by not letting them think, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I didn’t talk about on the review on GR was that the writing
in this book is good! Much much better than you would expect from a
plot-oriented dystopia. The author has gone out of her way to include lines like
these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yet it isn’t waiting, exactly. It’s more like a form of suspension. Without
suspense. At last there is no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or ones like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fatigue is here, in my body, in my legs and eyes. That is what gets you in the
end. Faith is only a word, embroidered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or this last quote from the early few chapters in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tell rather than write, because I ahve nothing to write with and writing is in
any case forbidden. But if it’s a story, even in my head, I must be telling it
to someone. You don’t tell a story only to yourself. There’s always someone
else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this book is a dystopia with some great writing! It’s the first book
that I have read that fits that particular description. I will definitely not be
reading another dystopia right on the back of this one because of some
unpleasant experiences in the past when I read two Orwell dystopian novels
&lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; back to back and had to stay away from Dystopia for almost a year
before I could start reading Brave New World (Huxley) which is not even a proper
dystopia, but it’s an undesirable world in any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up: Emma by Jane Austen. I was absolutely not joking when &lt;a href=&quot;https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/2017/03/09/day-20/&quot;&gt;I
said&lt;/a&gt; that
I would like to know why Amy Dunne thought that reading Austen makes for better
men that would be compatible with her. I aim to find out! Emma is a 470 page
book! It’s one of the longer ones and it is definitely not a wise move to pick
this up right now when there are so many things coming up (Western Groups,
Bachelors Thesis Project Presentation, End Term Exams etc) but I am going to try
to start reading anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say “try to start reading” because I tried to read Sense and Sensibility and I
couldn’t. Reviews on SnS (Austen) said that Emma was the &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; book to read if
you are just getting started with Austen! That sounded right to me, and I have
the habit of trusting online reviewers. No apparent reason. They took time to
write a reply to my comment or to write the review that they did on GR, there’s
no conceivable reason for them to lie about it unless they are just some
insginificant trolls or people who spam sites like GR for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 37 - A brief history of my blogging past and the tools I used</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/26/day-37"/>
   <updated>2017-03-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/26/day-37</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There were some serious &lt;em&gt;production issues&lt;/em&gt; in the past couple of posts. The
images were not properly downloaded (I downloaded them using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; and that
didn’t work out), titles were not right, categories weren’t added. I have fixed
all of that now, there was even a spelling mistake, a hilarious one too. I had
mis-spelled &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;synced&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sinked&lt;/code&gt;, I didn’t even notice it when I was typing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the quality of everything should improve from here on out, I am going to
visit the post and skim it right after posting. I think I should talk about why
I am using Jekyll for this whole series and also as my primary blog when there
are much simpler alternatives like Medium out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to blog for a while now. I first had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mylifeatiitkgp.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Wordpress
blog&lt;/a&gt; on Wordpress.com. (I logged into it
after 3 years with just one password attempt.  MEMORY GOING STRONG.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have just been seeing my posts, and there is a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of text on that
blog. I used to write quite a bit about TV series and things that happen inside
IIT Kharagpur. This was about 4 years ago when I had a slower laptop. It was a
Toshiba and it choked on running Google Chrome and EiskaltDC++ together. That
laptop was the reason that I was using the terminal for almost everything from
launching videos in VLC to editing with vim instead of Sublime Text because it
was too slow. (It had a Pentium processor, I think with 2 GB RAM. OLD!) Back
then, jekyll was just becoming popular with the whole Github pages thing being
rather new. So, I found a good theme and got started with publishing on GitHub.
There was maybe a 2 year hiatus after which I started this particular series and
started posting regularly. In the time in between, I posted semi-regularly,
about once in every 3 or 4 months. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mylifeatiitkgp.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Wordpress
archives&lt;/a&gt; [I can’t seem to get a list of
all my posts on wordpress, only monthly archives]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between this, I also used &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-shorter-posts.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;. I
really wanted to like it. It looked good on browsers and on mobile, I could
repost stuff from blogs I follow and post them there. This blog was mostly
quotes from the ASOIAF book series which I was reading for most of 2015 and the
early part of 2016. I also posted some normal write-ups about the status of my
life. I never used the mobile app for posting anything, only for browsing other
blogs that I followed, but the interest faded away soon and I stopped posting. I
wrote about 40 posts over a period of 10 months from November 2015 to August 2016. 
The most number of posts were in the first month, and then it came down
exponentially. &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-shorter-posts.tumblr.com/archive/&quot;&gt;Archive of Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, now I am back here since August 2016, I had not written anything before I
started this series. I felt really bad about not writing. In March 2016, right
before starting my internship, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@icyflame/i-am-going-to-start-writing-ceac3e108c28#.i543sko4h&quot;&gt;promised on
Medium&lt;/a&gt; 
that I am going to start writing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-mission/why-i-don-t-read-100-books-a-year-70452d5373d4#.pyl5m35ag&quot;&gt;this essay on medium&lt;/a&gt;, 
and realized that it applied to me. Not the
not reading 100 books a year part, I absolutely love reading and will continue
to read a lot, but I should start writing, despite not being good at it and all
that, one thing that made absolute sense was that I should start writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure it was just laziness that caused me to not go through with this
particular plan of mine. But I would say that I still had the last laugh, even
if it was 9 months later than I had said I would start, I started and now I am
37 days in! GREAT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL; DR&lt;/strong&gt; I used Wordpress, then I used Jekyll for some time before switching to
Tumblr for 9 months and then not writing anything for 4 months and finally
starting this series on Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A brief history of my &lt;em&gt;half-assed&lt;/em&gt; past attempts at blogging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 36 - Finding a solution to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS' "mouse not working" problem</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/25/day-36"/>
   <updated>2017-03-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/25/day-36</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://chomsky.info/199107__/&quot;&gt;Force and Opinion&lt;/a&gt;, an essay that
was posted on Metakgp Slack, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://metakgp.slack.com/archives/C0AHUL0JE/p1490285875717038&quot;&gt;I
posted&lt;/a&gt; my
surprise at having found the Internet Shutdowns in India. I am still reading it,
but it sounds like a solid thing to talk about in another post. I should
maintain a TODO list of topics that I want to talk about. (I am now switching to
Trello to create that list)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mouse thing happened again. This Ubuntu was started only about 3 hours ago.
This is extremely frustrating, I don’t want to go through the pain of
re-installing Ubuntu all over again with the right configuration and I don’t
want to have to keep restarting the PC. That would defeat the whole purpose of
having a GOOD COMPUTER! I need to find a solution to this problem, RIGHT NOW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AND FOUND IT!  &lt;a href=&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/178054/laptop-usb-ports-stop-working-how-to-restart-them-without-restarting-the-pc&quot;&gt;Restarting Laptop’s USB PORTS WITHOUT restarting
computers&lt;/a&gt;
Yet another lesson in effective searching of the internet! I went through the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dmesg -w&lt;/code&gt; output right before the mouse stopped functioning and it didn’t tell
me anything more than I already knew. Does it ring a bell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point 6937.288 is where the USB stopped functioning. See how the existing
mouse (connected as device 6) was disconnected and then reconnected as device
number 8. This lead me to think that &lt;em&gt;if only&lt;/em&gt; I could restart the USB module in
the kernel, it would detach and reattach ALL the USB devices. That would be the
best! I have my keyboard and the mouse connected on USB ports. A quick look at
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://askubuntu.com/a/178061/143446&quot;&gt;AskUbuntu answer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;modprobe&lt;/code&gt;
man page increased my confidence in the command posted there! So, this was the
solution I was looking for! This will go right next to my existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/dotfiles/blob/3a7d96774d5995e80771c5f6d0f7cb61fccfd468/zsh/system_aliases.zsh#L1-L2&quot;&gt;restart
network
manager&lt;/a&gt;
alias in my dotfiles. GREAT, this solves a huge inconvenience. This happened
yesterday while I was watching a movie and wanted to download the subtitles for
that movie. It was an incredibly high and unexpected amount of pain. I didn’t
anticipate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that has itself become a long post (probably because of the dmesg output
that I posted but it was totally necessary!) While I was writing that sentence,
it happened again (weirdly, the frequency seems to increase after fixing it
once. But frankly, I don’t care now, I will just continue to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;modprobe&lt;/code&gt;
while researching the problems that this could have. I can’t think of any
really, adding and removing modules from the kernel is NOT that catastrophic
really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I am really calling it here now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POST #36 is OVER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 35 - MISSED; Internet Shutdowns in India</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/24/day-35"/>
   <updated>2017-03-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/24/day-35</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I missed it. But this is fine, I don’t blame anyone for this. I slept and
woke up knowing exactly what I had done. I think the repenting part is more
important than just missing it. (It also means I can sit down for 1 hour and
write continuously about something that I haven’t decided yet!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was the Eastern Groups performance for the Social-Cultural General
Championship in IIT Kharagpur. These are inter-hostel competitions which are
elaborately arranged, practiced for and performed. It’s kind of a big deal for
everyone involved. I have done it since my second year. (Our hostel’s
performance was around 2330-2355 last night. I now know that we won the Gold
medal for our performance!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL5iG2ljuT4ph8rRR4R2RIejBPY2KX0HRy&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LISTEN TO THE LAST SONG!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after this I got back and didn’t write, even though I planned to. The
topic that I planned to write about was Internet Shutdowns. A little bit of
backstory on how I got to know about this particular topic was this &lt;a href=&quot;www.hotstar.com/tv/on-air-with-aib/6200/broad-bandh/1000170155&quot;&gt;On Air With
AIB - Broad
Bandh&lt;/a&gt; episode.
They talk about how the Internet was shutdown in India by state governments at
different points in time for absolutely arbitrary reasons. That they did was a
surprise to me because I have never been in a state where the government shut
down the internet, and these things also don’t happen to make it to Popular
media (or print media), both of which are SURPRISING AS HELL. Internet shutdowns
are a big deal and I would like to know that state governments can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing this, I was interested in how exactly they do it. Asking ISPs to
switch off their routers is one extremely simple way to do this, whether they
would or not, if they have legal recourse, etc etc are topics that I don’t know
much about and won’t speak because I think that ISPs would rather stay in the
good books of the state government considering that they need the state
government’s cooperation for licenses, laying infrastructure and while autonomy
and independence are great ideals; to imaging that ISPs have it would be too
idealistic a scenario. I can’t believe they do, they might simply just switch
their routers off. (Also, from a market point of view, if the government forces
&lt;em&gt;ALL&lt;/em&gt; ISPs to switch off their routers, they are not going to lose customers
because no one was able to provide internet anyway. That is an INCREDIBLY crude
estimation using my limited 2nd year HS20001 Economics course and what I learnt
there on Supply and Demand and how the ideal rational consumer would behave)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/03/21/india-had-the-highest-number-of-internet-shut-downs-in-2016_a_21903918/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-35-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph curiously shows that there were a negligible number of Fixed-Line
internet shutdowns. Very interesting! In a primarily mobile user (78%) market
like India, this is exactly the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet/india&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-35-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A
&lt;a href=&quot;http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/internet-access-government-restriction-shutdown-3102734/&quot;&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medianama.com/2016/05/223-internet-shut-down-azamgarh/&quot;&gt;has
been&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2016/08/month-since-indian-government-shut-internet-access-jammu-kashmir/&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt;
about this before the AIB episode. It’s an epidemic, and clearly the state
governments are using at the earliest sign of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the chaos that the lack of Internet propagates is much much larger
than the rumour spreading nonsense that happens on WhatsApp, primarily because
people forwarding messages that are cleverly constructed don’t stop when they
can clearly see that the authenticity can’t be verified. Beyond that, in most
cases the origin of these “forwarded messages” isn’t even clear. It goes through
many people before landing in some group of people who went to the same
school decades ago. Are these groups required? Maybe. Should you forward
&lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to this group? HELL NO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I will stop before this becomes a rant on forwarded messages in WhatsApp and
why I think the fact that the most time that you can snooze someone on WhatsApp
is 1 year is a cute effort on WhatsApp part to let people redeem themselves)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/bangalore-police-turn-to-whatsapp-to-improve-beat-system/&quot;&gt;the Bangalore
story&lt;/a&gt;
has really shown the &lt;em&gt;right way&lt;/em&gt; to use services like WhatsApp in an IM
friendly, always online world. If everyone takes this up, and squashes rumours
as they are created, there’s clearly no real way for rumour-mongers to get their
feet into the ground and gain traction. The authenticity of a message is easily
checked by &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; hosting the SAME message on a state government held HTTPS
domain. (Phishing these domains and creating other domains with almost identical
names with an e substituted for an a, etc is extremely simple. So, you should
always check HTTPS certificates and read out the name’s spelling so that your
brain doesn’t trick you into believing that they are the same word, JUST
mis-spelled)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the update system is solid enough to squash rumours and rather spread
messages (&lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; hosted on HTTPS government held domains), information will no
longer be a commodity that needs to come from unverified sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This topic is much more vast than I previously estimated. And as a matter of
fact, this is the first time that I have &lt;em&gt;MORE&lt;/em&gt; content for this blog than I
really intend to write. The remaining part of this will be about how an entire
country can be taken off the Internet. Something that Saudi Arabia does often
and Egypt did once. Egypt’s shutdown was particularly well documented with
some articles offering a lot of technical details. I will read all of that,
including the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and one day soon write a post about
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some helpful links if you are in India and would like to know more about the
internet shutdowns:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 34 - Prelude to Internet shutdowns in India; Surprise documented!</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/23/day-34"/>
   <updated>2017-03-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Content is needed. … The beast has to be fed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;a href=&quot;http://hcut.to/p/xZwxhve&quot;&gt;excerpt&lt;/a&gt; is from On Air with AIB, 
the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuWpO066gyg&quot;&gt;off script segment&lt;/a&gt; in
season 2. It’s completely true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the happy side, I am 78% through with Handmaid’s Tale! The story has spiraled
completely off the charts. The backstory is finally pieced together now, and the
present has taken center stage with some INCREDIBLE stuff happening. The
commander’s character had a surprising amount of depth, and when they finally
revealed (was it obvious?) that he was in one of the top positions because of
which all these privileges were accorded to him, I was rather surprised that he
was so different about something that he worked actively for. In fact, he even
defends it at one point in time. As if he meant to say that the old times were
not better but in fact worse than the present. Offred doesn’t buy it, I am sure
of that, she’s so clever. Also, the daughter’s name hasn’t yet come up and the
daughter is … Okay, that would be a spoiler. I don’t want to tag this. It’s
fine, that’s a minor detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram’s stories has this feature where once you post something to your
story, you can actually see who all viewed your story! The last time I posted
something, I didn’t notice that, but yesterday I did. It’s rather radical! (I
wish it had the selfie-and-respond property that was there in the Beme app.
Typing something in between a story was clunky, unnecessary and completely
restrictive while watching a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DDWKuo3gXMQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An old song that was overshadowed by Hello when it released. It also happens to
take some more space on the vlog. You should probably play that song, no matter
if you have heard it before or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other surprising thing that I saw / read / understood today was that
&lt;em&gt;Governments can shut down Internet for all the people in the whole country, or
in specific parts of the country at will&lt;/em&gt;. Apparently, state governments in
India often do this. This again was featured in the On Air with AIB season 2
episode “Broad Bandh”. I was surprised because I have never been in a place,
somewhere in India where this happened. There were a lot of things that happened
in Tamil Nadu in December 2016. A lot of it was rather sensitive and there were
plenty of rumours making the rounds. I would have thought at the peak of all
this activity, the government must ATLEAST have tried to get it done. I didn’t
hear about it at all, so it is safe to assume that this measure wasn’t
considered by the TN State Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there have already been incidents in Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/8288163/How-Egypt-shut-down-the-internet.html&quot;&gt;How they do
it&lt;/a&gt;
is an interesting networking problem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gigaom.com/2011/01/28/how-egypt-switched-off-the-internet/&quot;&gt;This
Gigaom article&lt;/a&gt; 
has a great explanation about what it means to “shut down” the Internet and how
countries typically do it. (Note that Satellite Internet survices should still
work even if Broadband (wired) and Mobile networks don’t work. Maybe you should
all get a satellite internet WiFi Router, my bet is that they are incredibly
costly and extremely slow. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/843639100771045377&quot;&gt;Is Slow Internet worse than no
Internet?&lt;/a&gt;: I happen to
disagree. Even if connectivity is slow, you can only go to TXT file websites and
atleast read at length. (Also, Amazon purchases are synchronised over Wifi and those
files are very very small. For reference, a 300 page book took about 1-1.4 MB of
data to download everything for me to get started reading the book. (It’s the
last part: the convenience of having your book and not having to 1. go to a
store, explain everything to a myrid number of attendants, and them having to
tell you that they have everything in the world BUT the 10 books that you are
looking for. 2. Not having to wait for the book to be delivered somewhere in
Rural India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are LOTS and LOTS of … I lost my train of thought. I am very very tired
from today. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 33 - Arduino LED Blinked for the first time;</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/22/day-33"/>
   <updated>2017-03-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/22/day-33</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;iframe width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XFNSKAs_ZTs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YES! I think that everyone reading this is going to think 1 of 2 things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(a) A
fourth year engineering student is getting so excited about getting an LED to
blink on an Arduino? Are you kidding me? AMATEUR!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(b) What is the big deal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, a back story is in order. I have been a part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://auviitkgp.github.io&quot;&gt;Autonomous Underwater
Vehicle&lt;/a&gt; since February 2014. That was the second
semester of my first year, since then I have seen people around me in the
Embedded and Electronics teams of this research group do &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; with Arduino,
other micro controllers, small computers like Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone Black
or Intel Galileo. I never &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; meddled with any of these and stayed within
the confines of larger computers whose motherboards were out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, through the years I have had the chance to look at others writing
code for an Arduino and the whole process of reset-burn-start for “sketches”
written for it. So, I am familiar with the process, but I hadn’t done it myself
till today. And that is why this is so important to me. To finally understand
the final part in most software-hardware interactions. The micro-controller is
as close to the actual circuitry as I can get for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I didn’t do this LED blinking thing simply because I wanted to. It
is part of the process of running a stepper motor (which DID work!) using an
Arduino and a Rhino Stepper Motor Driver. The connections were actually rather
easy to understand, and alongwith a couple of other Masters students, we were
able to get it to work today itself! It was pretty satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still inching ahead with Handmaid’s Tale, and the book has become rather
easy to read and understand because finally the dust is settling and we are
getting more information per page! I would be lying if I said that I didn’t have
fun reading the first obscure and opaque part of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow will be some more working with the Arduino and other hardware to get
&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; machine ready to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I got to thinking about 360 cameras! What a GREAT thing, essentially,
once they become the norm instead of a novelty (think: Digital Cameras in 2001)
there would literally be no requirement of a person to photograph or videotape
small family events like birthdays. There would be no Camera to “look into” and
say “cheese”. Everything around the camera upto a particular distance IS the
frame of the camera! No one is out of frame, you don’t have to squeeze anymore,
In fact, a circular group photo around the camera would make a lot more sense
because it could then be flattened and posted anywhere! So, they are very very
exciting for the casual video taping of events. Also, it makes the experience
easier because there is no longer someone who needs to monitor the camera. I
feel like I already said that and simply rephrased and wrote it again. Ah,
whatever. This series is not about quality writing (GOD NO!), it’s about
process. (And I am starting to enjoy it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Today is the 1/3rd milestone. Slightly less than that. (33.33333333…)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 32 - Game of Thrones Questionnaire; Bias for our solutions; awesome-social-science</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/21/day-32"/>
   <updated>2017-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/21/day-32</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRh23jHPxd8&quot;&gt;this
video&lt;/a&gt;. That video linked to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.questeros.org/About.cshtml&quot;&gt;The
Game of Thrones Research Project&lt;/a&gt; which
is a group of people who have put out a public questinnaire and are keeping the
responses open for a period of time. They plan to do something with the results
and entries that they are going to get from it. Apparently, this kind of thing
falls into the genre of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Audience Projects&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a longer explanation of what they plan to do with the data, and what
they hope to learn from it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.questeros.org/About.cshtml&quot;&gt;on this
page&lt;/a&gt;, and theses goals are mentioned
there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(1) To capture the range of responses that people have to the series, overall –
why and how it matters to people to follow the story, and see how it unfolds,
but also to understand why and how some people have been upset by particular
elements.  (2) To see how, for different people, this series finds its place
among other modern fantasy stories.  (3) To understand how people are bonding
with the very different kinds of characters that GoT offers us, and who so
often have awful fates ahead of them – and what sorts of pleasure you get from
this. (4) To find out how people relate to the big controversies that have
accompanied GoT – for example, the controversies around the changes from books
to TV, the altered fates of various characters, and the series’ portrayals of
sex, and sexual violence.  (5) And to have a go at thinking how this ‘fantasy’
world of Westeros and beyond is seen to relate to our world, our mucky,
violent, troubled world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the third point above about the characters is especially interesting to me!
I would absolutely &lt;strong&gt;LOVE&lt;/strong&gt; to know who the most liked character is (among the
show fans, this might unequivocally be Tyrion Lannister, but among book
audiences, I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to believe that Jaime has &lt;em&gt;a chance&lt;/em&gt;. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I also worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/metakgp/mfqp/issues/27&quot;&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt;.
The main goal of this issue is to create a “search” URL parameter which can be
pre-filled into the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; search bar on the MFQP frontpage. This would allow
for linking directly when sharing with other people or when adding to course
pages on the Wiki itself. (That way whenever new papers are added, they will
automatically show up in the MFQP link that is available on each course page)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some back and forth about the approach to solve this problem. The
contributor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/punit1108&quot;&gt;Punit&lt;/a&gt; implemented this by entering
into the message passing part of the code and editing it. Thinking about it at
first, I believed that it would be a really small change, and a bit more
investigation led me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/mfqp/commit/700b2aad09ac54f6baaf74e108fd43c854afd0a9&quot;&gt;this
patch&lt;/a&gt;,
which uses the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jquery-url&lt;/code&gt; library and fills the search box and then calls the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;search()&lt;/code&gt; function which will read the query, call the fuzzy search library
that is integrated into MFQP and finally show the results. This works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main arguments for my way of solving this problem are 1. the size of the
patch is way smaller and 2. it re-uses all the existing code and simply adds
some basic JS to use that code instead of delving into the message passing
mechanism. Also, my first impressions on seeing the old code (which I was doing
to get context on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/metakgp/mfqp/pull/29&quot;&gt;Punit’s pull
request&lt;/a&gt;) was that the message passing
was being used for the sole purpose of communicating that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;data.json&lt;/code&gt;
Network request has been completed and if there is any query that needs to be
made, it should be made &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the discussion wasn’t going anywhere with just the two of us, I called for
some more eyes on the code. The bias that we have for our own method of solving
a problem and believing that it is the most elegant and pretty way to solve a
problem often gets in the way and it’s best to get a second or third opinion
instead of trying to re-introduce objectivity to the discussion. How emotional
we are about a few lines of text that we write? :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this hilarious tweet series went out from me when I saw the first PR to my
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/awesome-social-science&quot;&gt;awesome-social-science&lt;/a&gt; list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/843464616223039492&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2017-03-21-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was yesterday, or the day before. Dhruv Apte
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/the-ethan-hunt&quot;&gt;@the-ethan-hunt&lt;/a&gt;) was kind enough to work
on it again and submit &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/awesome-social-science/pull/9&quot;&gt;another pull
request&lt;/a&gt;, this time
for the Golem Effect. I added the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/awesome-social-science#pygmalion-effect&quot;&gt;Pygmalion
Effect&lt;/a&gt;
entry some time ago, and it was a very very interesting read. I still remember
the lighting conditions changing for factory workers and the external
supervision by higher management, and how these two affected workers
performance. TL; DR Higher management presence even with bad lighting yielded
good performance from all the factory workers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to reviewing that pull request and probably making some changes
and merging it into the repository! One of his references came from the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm&quot;&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt;, which
surprisingly lets it’s users download full text PDFs of ALL the articles that
are on the website. I was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; surprised that they let people do that. Being
inside IIT Kharagpur, I have access to some of the popular services like
Elsevier, IEEE, ASME standards, but there are still a myriad other publications
out there which charge a whopping $20-$30 for every research paper! (For
comparison, 300-page Handmaid’s Tale cost me slightly less than $4.00)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the APA website looks good and hopefully I will be able to find some
time to read through some of the interesting articles. Also, it looks like a lot
of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/DNewsChannel&quot;&gt;D-News&lt;/a&gt; were sourced and
fact-checked here. It would make sense too, the issues look long and can be a
day job!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have rambled on for long enough.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 31 - Handmaid's Tale story revelation at 55%; GC Score visualization prototype</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/20/day-31"/>
   <updated>2017-03-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/20/day-31</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ah, finally! FINALLY! 55% into the book, Margaret Atwood thought it appropriate
to reveal the circumstances that lead to the world that Offred and Ofglen and
Of* live in. It was terrifying! I think I can now see where the comparison to
1984 comes from. I can’t really talk about it here without marking it as a
spoiler for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; who plans to read this book, so I would much rather talk
about it once I have read the whole book and this particular event has more
context around it. That said, this is a great book, I can make that judgement on
the basis of whatever I have read till now. It has been amazing! Sure, the
author took a lot of time to get to the backstory, but the story that she &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;
spend her time on was also interesting and worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I like books that keep the readers on their toes all the time by
changing the setting, going into long monologues that compare a small feature of
the present situation from something in the character’s backstory, essentially
introducing the backstory and &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt; showing the readers what the
character is thinking about, and what her mindset is. These books are pretty
challenging and fun to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing that I worked on today was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/gc-viz&quot;&gt;GC Visualization
prototype&lt;/a&gt;. The status quo looks something
like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://awaaziitkgp.org/GC201617.php?page=gc&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-31-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://awaaziitkgp.org/GC201617.php?page=gc&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-31-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://awaaziitkgp.org/GC201617.php?page=gc&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-31-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white space on the right side of the webpage in the above screenshot is
where the stacked bar graph &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prototype that I built looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://icyflame.github.io/gc-viz/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-31-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://icyflame.github.io/gc-viz/sports&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-31-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some major improvements over the previous page. One word: &lt;strong&gt;SPEED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been about 2 minutes since I opened the Awaaz IIT KGP page, and the Google
Visualization graph hasn’t yet loaded on Chrome 56 Linux x64. In fact, I think
it is never going to load now. There are quite a few errors in the JS console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: The chart loaded &lt;em&gt;mysteriously&lt;/em&gt; when I opened it about 15 minutes after.
That’s where the third screenshot above is from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D3.js is all about speed! It’s an incredibly small library and there are a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/&quot;&gt;LOT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/2/&quot;&gt;of
tutorials&lt;/a&gt; related to every single topic in
D3. In fact, the code that I have used in the second stacked bar graph above has
been directly copied from a bl.ocks.org created by the author of the linked
tutorials. He has &lt;a href=&quot;https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock&quot;&gt;a lot of other&lt;/a&gt; samples that he
has put up on BLOCKS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D3.js also offers two modes, HTML and SVG. The HTML mode is plain HTML made to
look like Graphs! SVGs are of course related to more complex charts, but for the
simple bar chart shown in the first screenshot above, I have simply used the
HTML bar chart! It’s FAST!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another logistical improvement for whoever is adding data to the website is that
the data is stored in CSV files, which can be directly exported from an existing
Excel sheet. Right now, the data is stored inside javascript lists like this
one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    var halls =
    [
      [&quot;hall&quot;,&quot;Athletics&quot;,&quot;Cricket&quot;,&quot;Chess&quot;,&quot;Squash&quot;,&quot;Football&quot;,
      &quot;Weightlifting&quot;,&quot;{role: &apos;annotation&apos;}&quot;],
      [&quot;MS&quot;,20,10,5,0,0,0,35],
      [&quot;RP&quot;,8,6,3,6,2,0,25],
      [&quot;Azad&quot;,0,0,1,2,10,10,23],
      [&quot;RK&quot;,0,4,0,0,4,6,14],
      [&quot;LBS&quot;,12,0,0,0,0,0,12],
      [&quot;HJB&quot;,0,0,0,10,0,0,10],
      [&quot;Nehru&quot;,4,0,2,0,0,2,8],
      [&quot;JCB&quot;,0,0,0,0,6,0,6],
      [&quot;Patel&quot;,0,2,0,0,0,4,6],
      [&quot;MMM&quot;,0,0,0,4,0,0,4]
    ];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas a CSV file is far easier to handle. Adding a new event here would
require adding a column at the second last place (unless this has been exported
from some CSV file using another script, which is TOTALLY possible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I have sent the prototypes out to some people. Hopefully, I can
get this on the Awaaz Website as an alternative way to view the General
Championship scores. This kind of a visualization improvement would make score
tracking and following developments very very easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This being a prototype, there are definitely improvements that can be made in
this. Most importantly, the colors. Right now, I have just used the six colors
obtained from combinating &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ff&lt;/code&gt; around the 3 places that are available. And then
using it twice. The colors are easily recognizable, but they are still really
bright and that’s probably not the best way to do this. (I wish I would
understand how to pick the right colors!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to the book, I hope that I can complete reading this book this week.
After this, I plan to read a book by Jane Austen (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/2017/03/09/day-20/&quot;&gt;Day 20: … Jane Austen
plans …&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 30 - Metakgp meetup to meet the candidates for Maintainer Election March 2017</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/19/day-30"/>
   <updated>2017-03-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/19/day-30</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, we had a Metakgp meetup to meet all the candidates in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Metakgp:Governance/Election_March_2017&quot;&gt;upcoming
maintainer
election&lt;/a&gt;.
So, to be clear, we are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; looking for a maintainer for one of our projects,
rather we are looking for a maintainer for Metakgp. Their roles are diverse but
would include day-to-day management, resolving conflicts between members, making
the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; decisions with inputs from everyone in the community and pushing the
community towards a consensus if the community can’t find it on it’s own, and
finally fascilitating an environment where new people would feel comfortable
joining and contributing. This
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Metakgp:Governance#Role_of_maintainers&quot;&gt;role&lt;/a&gt; is
much better described at the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Metakgp:Governance&quot;&gt;Metakgp:Governance&lt;/a&gt; wiki page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of candidates this year. And the process is proceeding pretty
smoothly. Everyone who has made a few contributions on the Wiki and atleast one
commit on one of the repositories in the Github organisation is eligible to vote
in this election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s meetup was about meeting the candidates, getting to know them, and
seeing them and talking to them about their &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;proposals&lt;/em&gt; for metakgp
and how they plan to move the community forward during their tenure as a
maintainer. Personally, I just wanted to meet all these people who are probably
going to be making some major decisions in the next 4-12 months. It was a great
meeting, and it ran for about 3-4 hours and we talked about all kinds stuff with
each candidate in turn. (It was structured too!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of points discussed, I would like to touch on a few of them
here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Involvement of a professor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At metakgp, we have been discussing getting a professor who can be “in-charge”
of the group for a long time. Almost ever since it was formed. The main idea for
this is so that we can have someone whom we can get to sign the documents that
need a professor’s signature (mainly, room booking forms) with far less friction
than right now. We have been dancing around the idea for almost 2 years now, and
it has never materialised until now, when we truly discussed this rather
seriously, probably because we are a student run organisation right now. We
don’t have any funds or anything. We contribute for server costs, we use the
free plans of most of the services out there. And not having any oversight
ensures that we can do whatever we want, without the fear of offending someone
in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Although, logistics does become harder with the lack of a professor and ends up
being prohibitive when trying to organise talks or movie screenings. (Last year,
Harsh Gupta and Vikrant Varma collaborated to organise a screening of the Aaron
Swartz documentary)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction seminar / Workshop / Hack days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In Kharagpur, each year 1400 starry eyed 17 year olds enter the campus as first
year students. They are waiting to be poached by societies around the campus. To
fascilitate this, Technology Students Gymkhana organises introductory seminars
for all of the popular socieites like Robotics research groups, Technology
Literary Society, Technology Dance Society, etc. Initially, I really liked this
idea. It seemed like a great way to spread the word among a huge amount of
people right when they enter KGP, and get them to start using metakgp from the
get go. But a point that Sayan Sinha (@americast on Metakgp Slack) brought up
was that people don’t get to learn anything at an Introductory seminar and thus
it’s more or less a waste of people’s time and a lot of people might not even
remember what was said there.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This got me thinking about whether this is a good idea or a bad one. There is
some kind of a compromise to be made here. Clearly, there need to be a few
improvements to the basic intro seminar idea (bad) to add a few ingredients from
the Hack days (good) to make the final result good.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I feel that talks are a great way to spread knowledge, talk to
people, and really get into the habit of sharing your experience and the things
that you have learnt with others, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; because they will not make the same
mistakes, but because when they do, &lt;em&gt;atleast&lt;/em&gt; they will know how to make it
right!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core groups inside Open Source projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is something that one of the people mentioned. I am not going to talk about
it in today’s write up, I need to make sure that there’s no issue that they have
with me talking about this. SO, I am going to leave it here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting people to contribute (and more specifically, getting more female
 contributors in KGP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This has been something that was recently brought up on the Metakgp Slack
#random channel. It is &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uAM0yE83xUu_Pwrc4HOZVNR2wqVd1USMUHzVyv6z2CI/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;summarized
here&lt;/a&gt;
by Naresh R (one of the candidates in this election).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Plainly speaking, to get more people interested in a project that you are wildly
interested in, but they feel &lt;em&gt;lukewarm&lt;/em&gt; about is an uphill task. There have been
a lot of magical ways to do this that have been suggested in the past, but I am
pretty sure none of these really worked.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To make this happen in an environment where money is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; one of the
motivations to contribute and spend your time on a project is probably twice as
hard (if not more). From the closely knit open source communities around
prominent projects like Git, the Linux kernel, Ruby, Python, Rails, etc it is
clear that even they are not able to “retain” people beyond an off hand patch
that people send now and then to really understand how an organisation works (I
sent one to GIT, too!)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are also probably some specific reasons why women don’t feel comfortable
working on Metakgp even though most of our work and discussion is done online on
Slack and Github, both of which are open to everyone. And the meet-ups that we
have happen at neutral places where both genders can roam around freely. These
are justifications as to why we are not biased, but there are some other things, 
like a low female participation &lt;em&gt;causing&lt;/em&gt; fewer new female members to join,
which I don’t know how to solve. Most maintainers have this on their agenda for
their tenure, so I hope to be able to work with them and everyone else active
right now to make this happen. Progress will probably be slow, but we MUST make
what little headway we can.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have made very very less progress with Handmaid’s tale. It’s not that the book
is not good, it is Good, but it’s confusing and highly taxing to read. The story
keeps shifting into either a flashback, or an abstract comparison with something
from Offred’s previous life, and it gets rather hard to keep track if you are
travelling or something. I hope to make a lot more progress in the next few
hours. I am going to install Abaqus (Ansys is installed, but Abaqus apparently
is something that people are more familiar with), so that should give me a few
hours of solid reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post was again missed, I keep thinking about whether I should start using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beeminder.com&quot;&gt;beeminder.com&lt;/a&gt; just to ensure that I have a stronger
motivation to wake up and write! As a matter of fact, I slept early last night
with intentions of getting back up again and writing (NEVER works out) and the
first thing that I thought of the moment I woke up this morning was that I had
missed posting last night! That shows motivation right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Besides all that, there’s been the huge new Wild Cards deal, the Wild Cards
reread, lots of stuff with HBO that I cannot talk about yet, and of course –
always, always – WINDS OF WINTER.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So much to do. And the days go by so quickly. I love my work, all my work, all
my projects, all my children, but sometimes it seems as if the harder I work,
the further behind I get.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Maybe things will calm down soon. But I am not holding my breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From GRRM’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://grrm.livejournal.com/527454.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The Winds of
Winter has been due ever since last March. I completed reading the 5th book,
A Dance with Dragons in December 2015. It was the completion of a series of book
in which each book had about 1000 pages. There have been rumours ever since that
the 6th book will be released within the next three months. Yeah, constantly.
There were a few rumours about it coming out before Season 6, then the book
coming out in December 2016, and now, this. There’s almost no hope that the book
might come out this year (?). The most pessimistic predictions for TWoW were
that it would come out in 2019, these predictions were from people who had
waited for the fourth book for 5 years (from August 2000 to October 2005) and
then 6 years for the fifth book (July 2011). 8 more years for the 6th book?
Frankly, I don’t know who could have predicted that. It’s been 5.5 years
already, anything before 2019 would be a good thing, I guess from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did most of the work for an assignment that is due next week. That was a lot
of C and a lot of matrix copying / extending / re-computing. Rather fun!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t really know what to write about. It’s been about 15 minutes since I
opened this file and edited the header. No idea has really occurred to me, yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next issue on Github that I am going to target is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subjects.json&lt;/code&gt;
inconsistency that is bound to happen between all Metakgp repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subjects.json&lt;/code&gt; is meant to be a JSON file that maps subject courses
offered in IIT Kharagpur to the name of the subject. Right now, there’s a JSON
file that’s used. I can’t be sure that the same version of the file is used in
these projects: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/metakgp/mfqp-source&quot;&gt;mfqp-source&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/metakgp/gyft&quot;&gt;gyft&lt;/a&gt;. These are the only two projects I can
find which use this file, I was convinced before that more projects used it!
Probably because people have often asked me for that file, and used it to some
other end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, submodules would solve this problem entirely. Must work on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still struggling to find something to write words about&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

shortest post till now. I will strive to do better tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 27 - MISSED; Some python and regex written for Gyft</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/16/day-27"/>
   <updated>2017-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/16/day-27</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;ARGH! I missed yesterday. It wasn’t even too tiring a day or anything, anyway, I
am going to make the best of this. I am about 8 hours later than when the usual
post should have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not been writing a lot of code, and I hadn’t submitted a pull request in
almost 20 days! &lt;em&gt;That’s unacceptable, Jimmy, UNACCEPTABLE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-27-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to remedy that situation today. Gyft is a set of python scripts which
lets you login into your IIT Kharagpur ERP account, get your timetable for the
semester from there. Before my patch, the only option was to put this timetable
into your Google Calendar. You generate a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client_secret&lt;/code&gt; file and give the
python script access to add recurring events to your calendar. It didn’t sound
right to me, and it was pretty cumbersome to use as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I wanted to enable exporting the calendar to ICS files. ICS files are
amazing! Every major calendar application supports them, they are apt for static
calendars like a Semester timetable. I had this idea in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/gyft/commit/4bf76fd2633870f274a1b952ea66abac63339fb9&quot;&gt;August
2016&lt;/a&gt;,
I opened &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/metakgp/gyft/issues/24&quot;&gt;the issue&lt;/a&gt; in December 2016. 
Since, it has just been vegetating because I wasn’t working on it, and the
whole Gyft repository has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/metakgp/gyft/graphs/commit-activity&quot;&gt;rather
inactive&lt;/a&gt; since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the patch that I had implemented already was the relatively
time-consuming part. It had a function which would build an event given the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/gyft/commit/4bf76fd2633870f274a1b952ea66abac63339fb9#diff-b284a28710cce90d9d9be3a7f4cabc8eR9&quot;&gt;appropriate
parameters&lt;/a&gt;
like start time, end time, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of this patch was to merge this with the parsing code that is
there inside the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;add_events.py&lt;/code&gt; script. It takes the data from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;data.txt&lt;/code&gt;
file (which is taken from the ERP) and parses that into event information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here comes the Regular Expressions part. The old parsing was done with
a complicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/metakgp/gyft/blob/bf3c2614d8508706f30bedca9419b6bf3dac2e33/add_events.py#L88-L129&quot;&gt;string parsing mechanism&lt;/a&gt;.
Frankly, I couldn’t understand what was being done, and I took a step back and
analysed the string that we do want to parse. It looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;10:0:AM-10:55:AM
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised that this was the best place to use Regular Expressions! A couple of
minutes in the Python shell led me to this regular expression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;TIMETABLE_DICT_RE &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;([0-9]{1,2}):([0-9]{1,2}):([AP])M-([0-9]{1,2}):([0-9]{1,2}):([AP])M&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Regex is clearly not optimal, there is no need to repeat the same Regular
Expression twice. Having it only once, should be enough. I should implement
that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But barring that, it worked out pretty well. The new parsing code which is part
of the new &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;generate_ics.py&lt;/code&gt; script was
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/gyft/blob/3e761cd3e2017ee2d876819df401df9dc791b24d/generate_ics.py#L89-L95&quot;&gt;smaller&lt;/a&gt;
and also returned a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; object instead of trying to write the complete
iCalendar event as per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545&quot;&gt;RFC (IETF RFC 5545)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/metakgp/gyft/pull/32&quot;&gt;this pull request&lt;/a&gt;
came out of my work today! I am awaiting reviews
on the pull request, and it should get merged soon. I have already generated an
ICS and added it to my Google Calendar! It looks good!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 26 - Communication on Slack;</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/15/day-26"/>
   <updated>2017-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/15/day-26</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I wrote
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/User:Icyflame/Unsolicited_advice_to_future_maintainers&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;START REPOST&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-important-things-i-learnt-along-the-way&quot;&gt;Other &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; things I learnt along the way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to others, think before you start typing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack and IM make communication easy … and complicated. Let me explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication is easy&lt;/strong&gt; if the parties communicating have a common goal,
and are putting in a non-trivial amount of effort into keeping the
conversation sane, unblocking themselves and getting to that common goal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication is easy&lt;/strong&gt; if the parties communicating have conflicting
goals, but listen to the other party and are willing to change their stance
if reasonable, technically sound arguments are posed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication is easy&lt;/strong&gt; if the parties communicating have opposite goals,
are unwilling to change their stance, but would still comply with someone
else’s opinion because of their inherent belief that the other person is
more experienced than them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication is complicated&lt;/strong&gt; if one of the parties communicating is
responding without reading and understanding the points being made in a
discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication is complicated&lt;/strong&gt; if one of the parties doesn’t know enough
to comment about something but still chooses to do so. See &lt;a href=&quot;.
  https://github.com/icyflame/awesome-social-science#dunning-kruger-effect-dke&quot;&gt;Dunning Kruger
Effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication is complicated&lt;/strong&gt; if an inexperienced party pretends to know
&lt;em&gt;how often something might happen&lt;/em&gt;, despite the experienced party clearly
explaining the reasons for their claim. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/awesome-social-science#dunning-kruger-effect-dke&quot;&gt;Dunning Kruger Effect&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication is complicated&lt;/strong&gt; if one of the parties is not interested in
reading the points that are being made or have been made in the past by the
other parties and their only interest is to propagate their own point of
view, because of reasons such as: ease, naivete, lack of the required
experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a solution approach seems complicated, Don’t shy away from it. Embrace
it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does a proposed solution to a given problem sound very complex and extremely
time-consuming? Don’t shy away from it. Try to get it done. Really try, spend
your time (and money) doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the times, you will solve the problem. Or you will come really close to
it! That’s good enough for the first time you do something complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a few of the times, things won’t work out. You ended up totally wasting your
time. But is it really a waste of time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just discovered a very complex solution to a problem. If it is a common
problem, why isn’t there an easier solution? Investigate, solve, spread the
word. You just made life easier for a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in all the other cases, you just learned that something was very
complicated. So complicated that you can probably share your experience about
doing it, once you manage to crack it. &lt;em&gt;That’s one hell of a story to tell
everyone!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;END REPOST&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, story time! About the second part. I can speak about it confidently
because I have had it happen to me once, and I chose to embrace the approach and
everything worked out fine in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was this one time, where I wrote a Rails application. It was called the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/mentorship-rails&quot;&gt;mentorship portal&lt;/a&gt;. It is a
portal to facilitate communication between Students and Alumni through the
Student Alumni Mentorship Programme. I chose to write it in Ruby on Rails with
help from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/light94&quot;&gt;Rahul Mishra&lt;/a&gt;. It was a pretty big Rails
application and I was soon losing track of how the development was going, I
learnt a lot more about Rails. But alas, deployment is where it really takes the
centre stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most famous method of deploying Rails on a LAMP stack seemed to be with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phusionpassenger.com/&quot;&gt;Phusion Passenger&lt;/a&gt;. And thus, it began. You
might want to let this song play in the background while you read the account. I
have found that this song makes a lot of accounts a lot more fun to read because
it is fast paced, and nostalgia wells up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;854&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGz6fQYskjY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I installed Ruby and Rails on the server. Apache was already installed, I knew
nothing about reverse proxying or apache configuration files till now. I knew
that you had to define the root of your websites in the apache configuration
files. That was the extent of my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was following a much older (and uglier) version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/walkthroughs/deploy/ruby/ownserver/apache/oss/install_language_runtime.html&quot;&gt;this
doc&lt;/a&gt;
on their website. The present documentation of this process seems to be really
nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation went through smoothly. Though there are two challenges here that I
would like to mention: The server didn’t have “full” internet, it is behind a
HTTP proxy server. The server doesn’t have any mailing access, there are no
other mail relays which have been configured to be used by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important step till now, is the addition of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VirtualHost&lt;/code&gt; tag to
the appropriate configuration file. There was a bit of a struggle trying to find
out exactly which one I wanted to add the code to. And I struggled a little bit
more to understand what exactly would be the “replacements” that I would have to
make to make the piece of code that’s there on their website to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with replacements is that they don’t cover corner cases, like ours.
We had a subdomain which had to be prefixed with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; to be access from outside
the institute network, and not prefixed with it to work from inside the campus.
I see that the documentation still doesn’t cover the case on what to do for
subdomains. I think we finally solved by adding a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServerAlias&lt;/code&gt; attribute inside
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VirtualHost&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this must have taken about a week’s worth of 4 hours a day
scratching my head about what to do, searching and going through a LOT of
StackOverflow answers and reading the documentation again and again to try to
find some hidden insight into what might be the problem: A did-you-know box that
would magically tell me what I had missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I realise now that I have made it sound a little bit too easy, perhaps! But
considering that I am writing this 2 years after the fact, I am happy with the
detail I could get.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I forgot to mention that there &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; a blog post that I wrote then.
Presenting &lt;a href=&quot;https://icyflame.github.io/blog/web-development/2015/05/01/deploying-on-an-inhouse-server/&quot;&gt;Deploying on an in-house server
(RANT)&lt;/a&gt;
dated 1st May, 2015. I have really invested myself in ranting about deploying on
in-house servers!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 25 - Quarter of the way there!</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/14/day-25"/>
   <updated>2017-03-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/14/day-25</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am 25% there. That’s one part in four, I just need to do the thing that I have
already done, 3 times over. Sounds doable, from here on atleast! I just wish I
don’t miss a day in between. I missed one day in between till now, and that was
not even the day I was &lt;em&gt;most tired&lt;/em&gt; on. In fact, the days that I was most tired
on, turned out to be the challenging ones when I struggled to write the 500
words and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git add&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to talk a little bit about the encrypted FS setup that I have got
going on, in my computer right now. It’s been about a week (or two?) since I
installed Ubuntu 16.04, and I setup two encrypted partitions when I was
installing it. Now, the dust has settled for the most part, and it is looking
&lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; now! This post is a continuation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/writing/ubuntu/installation/2017/03/04/day-15/&quot;&gt;the post on day
15&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added these two volumes to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/crypttab&lt;/code&gt; and to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/etc/crypttab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;partname UUID=... none luks,nofail
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;luks&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nofail&lt;/code&gt; in the last argument are VERY IMPORTANT. Without
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nofail&lt;/code&gt; flag set in that argument, the boot fails because it couldn’t find
the right password for that block device. Also, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;none&lt;/code&gt; must be spelled out
so that Ubuntu will interactively ask you for your password. This is only one
part of the setup though, only adding this will also lead to boot failure. More
on how to recover from there later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev/mapper/partname /media/username/mountpt ext4 defaults 0 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;partname&lt;/code&gt; is automatically referred once the block device has been unlocked
using LUKS and there are two parts of the partition now (the decrypted one is
mounted at the provided mountpoint).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not doing any of the above steps properly, will lead to a failure in the boot
process. What this means, is that the boot will simply fail and bring you to a
black screen (sometimes the screen also has text, I was a little bit panicked
to check what was going on on that screen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple way to get out of this is to boot into Ubuntu in the recovery mode, and
from there get a root shell. This root shell only has read-only access to the
disk. So, from here, you should run something like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reboot&lt;/code&gt; which will restart
your computer. There is a sequence of commands that can be run here to get you
to a root shell &lt;strong&gt;with&lt;/strong&gt; write access to the disk. I used this sequence to reset
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fstab&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;crypttab&lt;/code&gt; files to their default values when I ran into
trouble. Unfortunately, I can’t remember what that sequence is. I am sorry if
this part is so unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only say that rebooting was definitely part of the process, and then
something like “continue boot” in the recovery mode list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once on this write-access enabled root shell, you can do one of two things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rollback all changes to these two files, and restart. This will definitely
work all the time. You can simply make the right changes and then restart to
get it to work properly again&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are feeling adventurous, then you could change the files in this root
shell and reboot. If you have made the right set of changes, the interactive
password prompt will come up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t enter anything in the interactive password prompt for a long time,
then it goes to a blank screen. There’s absolutely nothing on that screen. I
had to pull the plug and restart both times that I ran into this problem. No
clue whether there is a better way to pull the computer out of this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I have not yet tested is what happens when you enter the wrong
password in the interactive prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POST #25 is OVER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I didn’t watch Revenant, actually. In the day 21 post, I said I would watch it,
but I couldn’t watch it. I started watching it, but they weren’t getting to the
point. I had a similar reaction to Avatar when I saw it for the first time, I
loved it afterwards. So, I will try again some time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started the day with this tweet which I thought indicated the end of my troubles with the left
click on the mouse not working with a new Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installation on a Dell laptop. It was
not, I faced the problem again about 12 hours after the tweet, and I tried this but the problem
didn’t fix itself. Interestingly, on disabling the ID that the DLL device shows, it simply
re-appears with a new ID. This happened earlier also, but I thought this was somehow the fix. I
tried disabling the complete pointer and that didn’t work either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bug has been reported before with Ubuntu 9.10 (yeah, that’s about 8 years
ago) on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/flashplugin-nonfree/+bug/410407&quot;&gt;Launchpad&lt;/a&gt;.
The only way to reproduce this bug that is mentioned on this bug page is to
“Click inside a Flash screen”. From the lengthy discussion on the bug there, it
is clear that this is most probably a window manager issue. Changing window
managers is rather easy on Ubuntu, you install something and it shows up in the
sessions and you change, it’s not that big a deal, to be honest. I would change
as soon I find something that I like. I have tried Tiling WMs like i3 in the
past, and they didn’t work out for me. They were just too weird and completely
radical compared to everything that I have become used to. Maybe some other
window manager! I have found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xwinman.org/intro.php&quot;&gt;this webpage&lt;/a&gt;
dedicated to offering users choice! Just what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read quite a bit of Handmaid’s Tale yesterday. I am about 1/3rd of my way
through that book, it is disturbing. &lt;strong&gt;Deeply disturbing.&lt;/strong&gt; I would not compare
it to 1984, because 1984 was about setting the scene as soon as possible and
explaining the character’s dilemmas in that strict system. This book is more
about a character who has accepted her situation, and slowly revealing the
situation that she is in, and the life that she had before she walked into this
one. I have read the synopsis so I know a little bit too much, I wonder how it
must have felt to have read the book &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; reading the synopsis, which
decidedly gives away a lot. (It would have taken atleast 45 pages for a reader
who hasn’t read the synopsis to understand what was going on with all the women
wearing red, whose names all start with “Of” WHY?)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 23 - Indian Railways DOS based systems (?); A great trip to Calcutta</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/12/day-23"/>
   <updated>2017-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/12/day-23</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was a trip to Kolkata for Biswa Mast Aadmi. It was a a GREAT SHOW! And it
was a wildly succesfuly trip also. Generally, my plans are foiled because of one
thing or the other, today everything worked well. There’s a first!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my way to Howrah, I had the chance to look at the screen on which the people
behind the ticketing counters in the KGP Station find ticket availability
between different stations, at different dates and different ticket classes
(Sleeper, 3AC, 2AC, etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ticketing is done on Text User Interfaces. Which apparently run using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT220&quot;&gt;VT220
Terminal&lt;/a&gt;. I discovered this from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Indian-Railways-upgrade-its-PRS-reservation-software-infrastructure-from-MS-DOS-like-terminals-to-any-contemporary-platform&quot;&gt;this
incredibly unhelpful answer on
Quora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-23-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things to note here. The IRCTC apparently has a huge Database
which is geographically separated, etc etc. That’s the backend part, that
doesn’t matter for the present discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VT220 terminal itself was introduced in 1983. Yeah, 1983. That is about 8
years before &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20100104211620/http://www.linux.org/people/linus_post.html&quot;&gt;Linus Torvalds started working on
Linux&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s also 34 years old now. Using a 34 year old frontend for ticketing? I can’t
see any real reason for that to be an intelligent choice. Isn’t it just better
to update atleast to a latest Linux version?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That aside, let’s look at how the DB is queried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entering the date, origin
station and destination station, and the ticket class: leads to a table that has trains running on that
between the two stations and the availability for each of the trains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost immediately, if there are no tickets, or even if there are tickets,
people want to try higher classes. This requires a change in one of the
parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If higher classes are not available for that date, people who are willing to
be flexible (which is almost everyone) want to know the availability of the
earlier day, the next couple days, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving all of this in a crowded station, where noise levels are pretty high
already leads to people having to shout to make themselves heard. It leads to
chaos. There are 2 ways out of this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A kiosk at the station: People should ideally use the IRCTC website for
checking availability. Or use the IRCTC mobile application. If they can’t,
there should be GOOD kiosks (for some reason, all kiosks have very very bad
touch screens and response times that range between 10s of seconds to 100s of
seconds. Why not just use a keyboard and a mouse? Why this obsession with
touch screens?)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Sidenote:
The IRCTC mobile
app is the WORST MOBILE APP that has ever been written. When you have clicked
on “Book Ticket” and gone through the payment and are waiting for your PNR,
the application starts showing you a non-cancelable Android notification. The
infinitely spinning ring. There’s no progress notification, you can know
nothing. When you are on something like LTE (which I was once on, That’s
where all this ranting is coming from), this takes forever. You can keep
waiting, and it will eventually show you a message that’s a rough equivalent
to “We couldn’t book the ticket. Money will be refunded in a few days. Try to
book your ticket again”. Now, there are plenty of mobile applications out
there with payment SDKs which are way way faster than whatever these people
are using. I am sure that any company would be happy to provide their
services to IRCTC atleast at a lower cost, not that cost would ever be a
prohibiting factor for the leading long-distance transport provider in a
country of 1.2 billion people. But seriously, GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text interfaces are incredibly powerful.&lt;/strong&gt; The terminal is one of the biggest
examples of this. Skilled users can use text interfaces much faster than
anything that requires touching or clicking on buttons with a mouse. That
said, the data that comes back from the commands should also make sense. Take
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; for example. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; is great, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ls -ls&lt;/code&gt; is better when you want to find out
the permissions of all the files, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ls -lsh&lt;/code&gt; when you want to include hidden
files, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ls -lg&lt;/code&gt; when you want to see the group that owns the files and
directories and so on. Basically, command line arguments. Would it be so hard
to design a system that parsed something like:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;GET KGP CST 26 +-1 032
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# GET trains from KGP to CST for the 26th of the present month.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# show availability for the next day and the previous day.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# show availability for ticket classes 2nd Sleeper (0), 3AC (3) and 2AC (2)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;GET KGP CST 4n +3 32
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# KGP to CST on the 4th of the next month. Show avail for the next three days&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# as well. Show only for 3AC and 2AC&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Given enough time, writing a fast parser (preferably in C, coming from the
benchmarks discussion in yesterday’s post) for these kinds of commands will
not be hard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some major caveats to this post. Not in the proposals that I have
made, I beleive they are fine, definitely not rock solid because I know very
little about ticketing except from whenever I have booked tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know if the TUI that they use is the VT220. That was from a Quora
answer dated December 2014. Things shouldn’t have changed in this short a
time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The backend that Indian Railways uses. It’s so hard to figure out what
exactly they are using. There’s the website of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cris.org.in/CRIS/Home/Home&quot;&gt;Centre for Railway
Information Systems&lt;/a&gt;, there is a dedicated
page to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cris.org.in/CRIS/Projects/PRS&quot;&gt;Passenger Reservation
System&lt;/a&gt; with a “Technology” page. It
doesn’t mention if this is a project that’s being developed for later
installment, or it’s already being used everywhere. It’s all a bit shady.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have seen Indigo (the airlines) use a similar TUI interface. They use
it for the generation of boarding passes and baggage tags at the check-in
counter. The people working on them are highly skilled at using these terminals.
So, clearly TUI has some advantage, whether IRCTC is tapping into all of it or
not is questionable to me. I will continue to try to dig up data about this, but
I get the feeling that that is going to be tough.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 22 - Thoughts on Programming Language design</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/11/day-22"/>
   <updated>2017-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/11/day-22</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was discussing Cloudbleed with my friend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SemiColonComma&quot;&gt;Kalyan
Kumar&lt;/a&gt;. He had this to say about it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And then … The final problem was that the generated C code didn’t have
proper checking for the pointer that breaks the code. Now this kind of stuff
are the biggest problems with C.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Secondly, most of the code currently at the core of the system is C. Take
anything, finally it will be converted to C, or uses some code that is C.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I don’t understand one thing. People keep blaming C for how it manages most
stuff. But when any kind new programming languages, structures that people
make, they use C at their heart to work. The new things are simply wrappers
around C.  If people are going to keep blaming C, they should invent something
that can replace C more fundamentally, at their core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last message is very interesting. In the past few weeks, and even in the
last semester, I have been writing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of C. About 3500 lines of C, since
the first week of January. About 2000 lines in the previous semester. All this
code is pretty heavy with data structures(&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;): Float matrices, A
collection of Float matrices in a 3D Float array, integer arrays, transforms on
the whole table, etc etc. All of this has to be dynamically allocated on the
basis of whatever input the user enters. So, that’s a lot of memory being
allocated and freed in the heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when people blame C for managing pointers and memory in general, it’s about
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SEGFAULT&lt;/code&gt;s that people talk about. C trying to access memory that’s not
it’s own, that hasn’t been declared by it, but just happens to be lying around
some other memory that &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C does pointers well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you have to think a lot about the sizes that are being allocated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you learn a lot more about design and literally how arrays of higher
dimensions work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you also happen to learn about how to decide what arguments should be passed
by value, passed by reference, which ones should be pointers etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is invaluable. So, we have established that it’s a great language to
“LEARN”. A great Academic tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you have to use it somewhere in the real world, that’s when things
become irritating. I think that languages need to be designed so that the
details are abstracted out but we can still hang on to some performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-21-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ideal language would have a design where&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is hard to make mistakes inadvertently&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The tooling around the language enforces this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java, inside Android Studio, comes pretty close to this ideal. There are
caveats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java does a good job of this by actively discouraging that you change anything
passed as an argument, by passing everything by reference. Obviously, that isn’t
ideal because then you have to return values and re-assign stuff and so on and
so forth. In applications like Android, this is really annoying. Other
approaches that the language takes towards types, object oriented design makes
the language very very &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt;. Lots of characters even for the simplest stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this piece of code that calls some functions whenever a timer runs out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mTimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;schedule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TimerTask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cancel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;everything&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;here&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mTimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;cancel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mTimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;purge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Helpers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;timeout&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Time up for this question! MOVE ON!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mAllottedTime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case, the operation inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;run()&lt;/code&gt; had to be done on the main thread, then it
would be some more lines of code where you would call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;runOnUiThread()&lt;/code&gt; and pass
it a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Runnable()&lt;/code&gt; with some initialisation, etc etc. Incredibly verbose. And all
we are trying to do is schedule some task. (An example of this would be having
to touch a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TextView&lt;/code&gt; or any UI element and change one of it’s fields:
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mMessageForUser.setText(&quot;YOUR TIME IS UP!&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the point about making it hard for people to make mistakes,  Java
tried to avoid inadvertent exceptions by forcing people to wrap blocks that might
throw exceptions in try-catch so that no exception ever goes unhandled. This
immediately stops all crashes. Java also forces everything to be strongly typed.
That’s a pain every single time because APIs change, and when they do you have
to re-think a lot of the downstream code, or you should have had the insight to
design it in an extensible manner in the beginning itself. In either case, it’s
time spent improving old code that was working perfectly well, when you could
have spent that time writing new code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, another thing that’s probably useful when dealing with things like Android
applications where the user might know about interruptions: All interruptions
are handled seamlessly. The user doesn’t need to know that an app malfunctioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App crashed? Just restart the application and show them the first screen. People
understand, you need not go out of your way to show them that the app was not
designed properly and an obscure test that missed their test case nets happened
and the app crashed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR When writing code in IDEAL, it’s incredibly hard for programmers to make
mistakes that could lead to crashes or catastrophic stuff like SEGFAULTS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In IDEAL, it will be painfully obvious what arguments are passed by reference
and what arguments are simply passed by values in IDEAL. Memory leaks would be
avoided in IDEAL by having a good garbage collector, which will keep RAM usage
to the minimum. The GC part is definitely harder than it sounds, and definitely
a part of the responsibility lies with the developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDEAL Is a hypothetical language that doesn’t exist as yet. (Or maybe it does,
and I am too daft to have not tried it out yet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Kotlin sounds like Java minus all the stuff that makes it so verbose. I
haven’t tried it, but I would like to. It looks good!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 21 - S3 Outage and Cloudbleed post mortems are out; Revenant!</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/10/day-21"/>
   <updated>2017-03-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/10/day-21</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am happy to report that the MP3 files not being recognised by Rhythmbox was
solved after &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras&lt;/code&gt;. I wonder what “extra”
packages that package contains that need to be restricted. It definitely
installed &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; which is a great CLI utility to cut videos. Anyways, that
problem is solved. I am still holding off on installing gnome-shell and trying
that out because the mouse thing seems to have sorted itself out (?). It
happened only once today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/amazon-web-services-data-center/423147/?utm_source=mitfb&quot;&gt;This great article about Amazon Data
Centers&lt;/a&gt;
is right on point! This comes in the wake of that great S3 outage a few days
back. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/&quot;&gt;post mortem for that outage&lt;/a&gt;
is out, and it was a mistake in passing an argument to an &lt;em&gt;established
playbook&lt;/em&gt;. Which is incredibly basic and could literally happen to any one. It’s
like meaning to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rm -rf ../basic&lt;/code&gt; and then typing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TAB&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rm -rf ../b&lt;/code&gt;
and pressing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ENTER&lt;/code&gt; without checking if the basic was autocompleted or not.
It’s so simple! It still happened, and that post mortem is definitely worth
checking out if ever you write a script which has two conflicting, really close
arguments, one of which might create some major problems. This is also a great
lesson on designing parameter names in such a way as to make the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; commands
(like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ps ax&lt;/code&gt;) small, intuitive and incredibly fast but the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt;-like
commands like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deluser&lt;/code&gt; long and cumbersome (maybe not too much, but still
something more than &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt;). I would definitely type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;trash&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt; if
that meant I will one day save myself from deleting an important directory.
(This is like Minority Report!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about post-mortems, lets talk about Cloudbleed. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/&quot;&gt;incident
report&lt;/a&gt;
came in very soon, and it was a terrible leak. A memory leak that just kept
reading from memory because the HTML wasn’t formatted properly? COMMON! Who is
going to be able to protect against stuff like that. More importantly, the bug
itself aside, let’s talk about the steps that CF took to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An additional problem was that Google (and other search engines) had cached some
of the leaked memory through their normal crawling and caching processes. We
wanted to ensure that this memory was scrubbed from search engine caches before
the public disclosure of the problem so that third-parties would not be able to
go hunting for sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, this insight into search engine caching and reducing the impact
by directly talking to multiple search engines and getting these caches purged
seemed like something that CF thought of on the fly and managed to nail! This is
some great engineering stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We also undertook other search expeditions looking for potentially leaked
information on sites like Pastebin and did not find anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AH HELL! They are so thorough. &lt;strong&gt;Incredible detail!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Revenant is on the watchlist. It’s a 2.5 hour movie, that’s some commitment
right there. Gear up, get started!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 20 - Handmaid's Tale; Jane Austen plans; Office Space (1999)</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/09/day-20"/>
   <updated>2017-03-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/09/day-20</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I waited patiently - years - for the pendulum to swing the other way, for men
to start &lt;em&gt;reading Jane Austen&lt;/em&gt;, learn how to knit, pretend to love cosmos,
organize scrapbook parties, and make out with each other while we leer. And
then we’d say, Yeah, he’s a Cool Guy.” ― Amy Dunne, Gone Girl (Gillian Flynn)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those inner monologues that Amy has. The Jane Austen reference in
this line was incredibly interesting to me. Amy was such a great character! How
could you not be curious about what she really meant and what she really wanted
Nick to be like? Why did she settle for Nick?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question that I had when I watched the movie (which was answered in the
book): &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Why did she move to Missouri with Nick if she wasn&apos;t into it?&lt;/code&gt;. It was
like some sort of “complicated pay back” for her giving away most of her trust
fund money to her parents when their publisher drops them. That’s what the move
was about. The reference to her being jettisoned, and her being unwanted luggage
and all that is an addition in the movie. The book takes a much subtler route to
show her disgruntlement with Nick over the move to Missouri and the reduction of
his involvement in the marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/news&quot;&gt;HackerNews&lt;/a&gt; is a facinating place. It’s like
Reddit but filled with a lot more articles, and much much more passionate
people, if you go by the comments. There is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of disgust thrown at it,
though. I have seen HN being made fun of whenever the discussion takes a turn
for the worse and stops making sense. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/awesome-social-science#godwins-law&quot;&gt;Godwin’s
Law&lt;/a&gt; seems like
a really good analogy to use here. (It has happened even in conversations where
there were enough paths to choose from for further discussion but people
inevitably chose to go ahead with the Nazi reference!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38447.The_Handmaid_s_Tale?from_search=true&quot;&gt;Handmaid’s Tale - Margaret
Atwood&lt;/a&gt;,
while a quick look at the synopsis pointed at something like a social commentary
(?), the reviews seem to compare it to 1984 (Orwell), which is terrifying to say
the least. I had to read P G Wodehouse and stay off of Dystopian books for
almost 4 months ever since I read 1984. I read Brave New World (Huxley) about 8
months after I completed reading 1984. Hmm, that’s a long long time. Catch 22
was crazy too, but nowhere close to as impactful as 1984.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fresh Rhythmbox on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS refuses to recognise MP3 files because it
needs to install “extra software”, and that doesn’t work because the “Main
Server for India” which is the default setting as the source for Software
Packages. I have just started installing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ubuntu-restricted-extras&lt;/code&gt; from the
main Canonical server and it seems to be working fine. I hope it does though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all of this, what really blows my mind is VLC. VLC somehow just works. I
ran &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get install -y vlc&lt;/code&gt; and once VLC was installed, I can play any
normal format with it: MKV, MP4. The file could have any of the available video
and audio codecs, and it would work just fine. It’s too bad VLC doesn’t have a
counterpart that would maintain music libraries like Rhythmbox does. That would
be such a hit, it would be exactly like iTunes, but a whole lot faster!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 19 - NPM woes; KGP Internet woes; Ubuntu 16.04 woes;</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/08/day-19"/>
   <updated>2017-03-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/08/day-19</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had a weird experience with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;, it’s absolutely weird. I wrote a
series of tweets about it. Hear me out again anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/839529290760757249&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2017-03-09-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the proxy for Kharagpur’s network on my computer and in all my setups.
NPM typically reads them, or so they say, it didn’t when I first tried &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm
install&lt;/code&gt;, sure, no problem. I do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm config edit&lt;/code&gt; it should start working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over the past few days, the internet in IIT Kharagpur (more on this soon)
has gone from okay to bad to absolutely worse. Right now, it’s probably at it’s
worst point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; editing the config file. It doesn’t work because the
network is too slow, and the connection gets reset by the peer. I was done with
this, a 4G hotspot should solve my woes. This is where it gets weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After connecting to the hotspot, I removed proxy declarations from my Ubuntu
system settings. The Env variables are still there, but from step 1 it is clear
that NPM doesn’t regard them, so I let them stay and ran &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; again. It
didn’t work. It said that it couldn’t connect to the proxy. How weird is it that
the proxy doesn’t work when you want it to work, and when you don’t want it to
work, npm magically decides to take the env variables into account?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have all four versions of the variables set up correctly. Namely:
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https_proxy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http_proxy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HTTP_PROXY&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HTTPS_PROXY&lt;/code&gt;. It’s not about
that. It’s just some quirky behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet in Kharagpur is through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://workshop.nkn.in/2012/Document/slides/NKN%20Overview.pdf&quot;&gt;National Knowledge
Network&lt;/a&gt;.
Articles have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scholarsavenue.org/ga/internet-in-kgp-a-recent-take/&quot;&gt;written about the internet
speeds&lt;/a&gt;. As
this article says, Youtube is literally the only site which can be used with the
least amount of pain. Other sites just keep dropping, it’s highly irritating. To
say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodreads is perhaps one of the worst hit sites ever. I use Goodreads quite a
bit, and it never seems to be able to load at all! Other CMS sites like
TheAtlantic, Guardian, NDTV.com and all these news websites have also been hit.
They tend to load their page at the second try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to the command line, pip, npm, git clone from Github or Gitlab seems to
hang up in the middle and just say &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Connection reset by peer&lt;/code&gt;. PIP has the
caching ability with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo -EH&lt;/code&gt; flag, so that’s still manageable. NPM is
just completely hopeless (so much so that it can’t even make the first &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt;
request to the registry! Some really dark times, if it has come down to a GET
request to a registry). git reports the same connection reset error. Pushing
through ssh seems to have been barely affected, that I am grateful for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this post seems to be filled with rants about things that don’t work on my
computer which has a BRAND NEW Ubuntu 16.04, I will also add this for good
measure. 16.04 has given me a really really bad time, till now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mouse stops working for no reason at all. It is still pointing, but I
can’t do anything else with it: no scroll, no clicking, etc. I have to
restart the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I restart the computer and then play a song, it doesn’t play on the
speakers connected to the headphone jack. I have to disconnect and reconnect
them, for them to start working again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Internet is connected in a DHCP setting with an IP in the range 10.&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;,
but weirdly, in between the IP changes to 192.168.&lt;/em&gt;.* and stays there.
Internet obviously doesn’t work because the other things like the Router IP
have also changed. This needs the disconnection and reconnection of the
Ethernet cable&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, this new Operating System isn’t playing well with my 2 year old
Dell computer, and a 6 month old HP mouse. I am going to give this another shot,
or just install Arch and be done with it. Maybe I will have better luck there!
(Or something like Gnome or KDE or XFCE, which &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; solve the problems that I
am having with the combination of compiz, X and Unity. &lt;em&gt;HUGE might&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two posts were about Big Little Lies, the book, the TV series, the
work. It would be remiss of me to not mention that I have now caught up with the
TV series, and am eagerly waiting for the next episodes of both Homeland and Big
Little Lies.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 18 - A little bit more Big Little Lies; Vault 7 (?)</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/07/day-18"/>
   <updated>2017-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/07/day-18</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I kept thinking about Big Little Lies, I completed reading it yesterday and I
fell for Celeste White (who is called Celeste Wright in the TV series). Madeline
is of course a different kind of a person, the exact opposite of Celeste in a
lot of ways, but they are friends still because Celeste doesn’t talk too much,
stays silent most of the time, disoriented and always late. Whereas Madeline is
talks all the time, takes on people and causes. What a character!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entry scene for Celeste (Nicole Kidman) in the show, glorious with her
forehead frills and lost expression, is good! But it isn’t in slow motion! I was
SO eager to see that scene in slow motion. This is generally what happens
whenever you read a book, and have a scene in your mind and then, the movie or
the TV series doesn’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; show exactly what you had in mind.
Disappointment. (Case in point: Dark Places, the scene where the girls and the
mom realize that their brother and son (Ben Day) has colored his hair black
where the common thread in all of them is their red hair. This scene is
incredibly emotional and chaotic, even in the book. And in the movie, it’s
literally a breeze. Not even a big deal.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other episode I managed to watch today was Homeland’s 6.7. It was one hell
of an episode, with some major betrayals! The turn that the show has taken from
characters not liking each other to characters &lt;em&gt;actively&lt;/em&gt; plotting against each
other is incredibly disturbing. Twisting facts, pointing and aiming people at
each other like countries do with their missiles, it’s incredibly dark! Homeland
has been dark before, but it was always about the situation, the characters were
never in conflict with each other for imaginary stuff. This time, they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The
CIA/Wikileaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the
exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Open
Whisper Systems (@whispersystems) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/whispersystems/status/839204754718932992&quot;&gt;March 7,
2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is millions of lines of code and emails that WikiLeaks &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/&quot;&gt;has
said&lt;/a&gt; under a project called Vault 7. This
apparently has some documents that talk about targetted attacks on iOS and
Android. Curiously, there isn’t anything about Blackberry or BBM. BBM uses a
proprietary protocol owned by RIM, and of course, the userbase for Blackberry is
so low now that they probably didn’t want to spend any time on a dying platform,
still. Blackberry is still (probably) safe because attacks haven’t been designed
against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, all these attacks require the smart TV, phone, computer to be
connected to the internet. The easiest way perhaps then, is to disconnect as
much as possible. Use a VPN whenever connected, and constantly keep checking
that the wrong ports aren’t open on your machine. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nmap -Pn localhost&lt;/code&gt; should
always say &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;All 1000 scanned ports on localhost are closed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, please &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get remove openssh-server&lt;/code&gt;. Such an annoying package to
accidentally install.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 17 - Big Little Lies closing remarks; Homeland new episode anticipation</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/06/day-17"/>
   <updated>2017-03-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/06/day-17</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;97% done, I can’t really start writing the review for Big Little Lies on
Goodreads, but I can definitely say one thing about this book: IT HAD AN
EXPLOSIVE ENDING. COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED, and it’s not unexpected in the old
fashioned new-character-arrives-and-then-wtf? way, but in a
this-ending-ties-up-loose-ends-all-over-the-book way! It would, of course be a
HUGE spoiler, so I can’t really talk about it. Which isn’t ideal, but I can bear
that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, this book is now a HBO TV Series: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Little_Lies_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Big Little
Lies&lt;/a&gt;. For this TV
Series, I made some predictions for who would be cast as which character when I
had just started reading that book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For now, I think Kidman is Celeste (from Jane’s description of Celeste when
she first sees her), and Reese is probably Jane (?). I still haven’t seen the
trailer or anything, so this is rather exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atleast one of my predictions turns out be true! Apart from this, in the TV
series, I am glad to see how they plan to show a single plot point that’s easy
on paper, but much harder in TV without making the right connections in the plot
and also keeping the realization scene on trivia night make sense. This show
goes right on to my to-watch list!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the ending, the characters that I fell in love with even more than before
was Celeste! Her off-hand way of analysing her wealth, and how she &lt;strong&gt;married
up&lt;/strong&gt;, in her own words, is a refreshing take on wealth and how the wealthy
really feel delicate and subtle around everyone else. Especially, her internal
monologue about how she could easily solve most of Maddie’s or Jane’s problems
with money, but Maddie wouldn’t really accept her gifts and that was the basic
problem with her approach!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another telling line that happens with Perry is when &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; happens and
Celeste thinks to herself &lt;strong&gt;Perry wouldn’t like being embarassed in front of Ed
and Madeline, both of whom he admired&lt;/strong&gt;. Of course, this line … That would be
a spoiler. I decided to drop that line from here. God, it’s so hard to talk
about this book in a clean manner!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another episode that’s also on my watchlist if Homeland’s 6.7. Already, Twitter
has gone crazy over it with the connection between Quinn and Carrie becoming
even more pronounced! It would be so anti-climactic if they don’t get together
by the end of this season. There are 6 episodes left, so there’s a lot that can
still happen. I am frankly rather shocked with how GOOOOOD this season is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other TV series that I have seen, that have gone upto season 6, were Grey’s
Anatomy, The Vampire Diaries, both of them went downhill from their season 4.
Both those series are still going on, probably (?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, something major seems to have gone down in this Homeland episode! The
photo that came out of Franny, Quinn and the stuffed-rabbit Hop has gone
absolutely viral (?) in the Homeland fan handles atleast. Saul is at this point
in the season hopelessly sidelined. Keane has also been &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; equally
sidelined by Dar (whose power is worthy of admiration!). Hopefully, this
situation will resolve and Keane will talk to Carrie about the Seku Bah
situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t believe it’s been only 17 days since I started doing this. It seems like
an eternity! I guess when you have to write atleast 400 words each day, days
seem to go by slower than they would otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 16 - zsh, color schemes and auto-mounting partitions with an elegant password prompt</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/05/day-16"/>
   <updated>2017-03-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/05/day-16</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is part 2 of the installation diary. While the backing up and install
process was done, an installation is only complete &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; everything goes back
to normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; shell, aliases, functions. I maintain a &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; dotfiles
repository, which I have improved over time. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/dotfiles/blob/master/bootstrap.sh&quot;&gt;bootstrap
script&lt;/a&gt; is a
shell script that does a lot of stuff. I use it in my default User data on
Digital Ocean droplets, when I create one, and it works really well! This will
install my shell of choice: zsh, and will also install all the other basic
things that are definitely required: ruby, node, vim. This gives a great point
to start at for other packages that you also need but can do without for some
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a slight hiccup in the zsh installation, probably because something
has changed in the zsh readme or setup (?), but I didn’t care to spend any more
time there, so I quickly ran the script that was there on the readme, and zsh
was installed with my favourite oh-my-zsh theme: ys. It’s a theme that uses only
basic ASCII characters that ensures that it will work on all machines! I hate
seeing boxes where tick marks should have been. The way &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ys&lt;/code&gt; shows an updated
git tree with a green &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;. And un-updated trees are shown with a red &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. Both
of those choices are great, and completely compatible! So great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; After this, comes the all important color scheme setup. The color scheme
&lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be Solarized Dark. (Not really, I just love it a lot more than any
other scheme. To each, their own!) I use base16 because there is a regression
in the earlier one I used
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Anthony25/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized/issues/32&quot;&gt;gnome-terminal-solarized issue #32&lt;/a&gt;)
There has been extensive discussion on this issue and a related issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/altercation/solarized/issues/220&quot;&gt;solarized
issue #220&lt;/a&gt;. I first encountered
this issue when I was switching to gnome-terminal-solarized from the default
solarize option that is available in the preferences menu. Clearly, nothing has
been fixed or updated since then! I couldn’t understand a lot of the discussion
on that issue unfortunately. Anyway, base 16 provides a good dark 256 base which
works pretty well! The solarized dark 16 color scheme doesn’t work because the
color of the bold text used for listing executable files is almost the same as
the background color and completely invisible. Examples ahead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-16-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 1: see the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;a.out&lt;/code&gt; file’s color. It’s hardly visible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-16-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 2: ah, much better!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I zoomed into the terminal for taking those screenshots, and did that look
gorgeous! :D And I am &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; on a 1080p ancient Samsung Matt finish monitor. I
think it’s the Matt finish of the display that makes this look so great! If you
have matt finish, then you probably know what I am talking about out. If not,
well!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Partitions: Mounting the un-encrypted partitions AND the encrypted
partitions, all at startup in a proper fail safe manner. No one should be able
to read anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happened in two iterations because I made a mistake the first time around.
I added this line to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/crypttab&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code UUID=...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restarted the computer. The boot failed. Booting from recovery and trying to get
in dropped me into a root shell which thankfully had write-access to the disk. I
removed the offending lines from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;crypttab&lt;/code&gt; and restarted, and things were
fine once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second time, I did it right: Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://evilshit.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/how-to-mount-a-luks-encrypted-partition-on-boot/&quot;&gt;this
tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.
I was a bit doubtful about this because it didn’t have a picture of how the
interactive password prompt looked like (it actually looks really good!) and
it’s 5 years old. Anyway, I took the plunge and it worked. On to the
un-encrypted NTFS and FAT32 partitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6LFBteVAAEaTF_.jpg:large&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were much simpler. I used &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;udisks&lt;/code&gt; in Ubuntu 14.04. Now, that command has
changed to a simple &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;udisksctl -b /dev/sda3&lt;/code&gt; etc. Add this to the Startup
Programs list that comes up when you search on the Dash, and you are done! Much
easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, thus, I am more or less done with my installation. It was a pleasant process
except for the backing up part which was a bit problematic because of the sheer
lack of space! More stories tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 15 - Brand new Ubuntu 16.04 LTS</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/04/day-15"/>
   <updated>2017-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/04/day-15</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;YAY! Brand new Ubuntu! The installation took a LOT of time. Most of which was
spent in partitioning the drive properly. I had a good plan for how to do it,
but the encryption thing really got in my way, and took up a lot of time. So,
here’s the long and short of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I didn’t really know whether the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;) partition can be
encrypted or not. While encrypting that would have been good, I didn’t mind &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;
being unencrypted because it mostly just had installation files and config files
and not any personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;a tutorial on the internet&lt;/a&gt;, told me that I could
actually have encrypted root partitions. I just had to give a few 100 MB to the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/boot&lt;/code&gt; partition which would have all the files in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; that are absolutely
required just for booting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I followed that guide. It &lt;strong&gt;didn’t&lt;/strong&gt; work. In the guide’s defense, it is
almost 5 years old. I hoped that it would work, but after a few attempts which
took up almost 2 hours, I had resigned to my fate and accepted that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; couldn’t
be encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; of course could be encrypted, and in fact, there’s an option right after
the partition table screen, so just create an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ext4&lt;/code&gt; partition, choose the right
mount point and tick the encryption option on the next screen. A breeze!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining two partitions that I wanted, LUKS + ext4 partitions were a bit
tricky. Basically, if I selected an encrypted &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; partition in the partition
table screen itself, it wouldn’t let me proceed with an unencrypted &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt;
partition. This is not &lt;em&gt;totally bonkers&lt;/em&gt;, but is &lt;em&gt;slightly bonkers&lt;/em&gt;. Swap is
highly volatile, has some process information and keeps changing, it’s
unreasonable to believe that I want an unencrypted swap. Weirdly enough, if you
encrypt &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; from the screen where you have to enter your username and
password, it won’t bother you about the encrypted &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; partition. So, maybe it
is tied to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; partition’s encryption? I don’t really know exactly how
that screen works, and I would love for it to be a little bit more presentable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about the partition table screen, it’s horrible. I can’t maximize it for
some reason. You have to “scroll” horizontally to see the partitions, and the
partitions &lt;em&gt;crazily enough&lt;/em&gt; have colours in the main timeline like diagram, and
there is an index below them that is NOT EVEN aligned! My god, it was such a
terrible screen. Why don’t they take pointers from gparted’s beautiful way of
showing partitions? Even Windows’ Disk Manager (run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;diskmgmt.msc&lt;/code&gt; after
pressing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WinKey+R&lt;/code&gt;) shows partitions in a very sane fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the partition step, you select the timezone, enter your username password, and finally, it
starts installing. The downloading packages step took a long time, almost 2 hours, the rest of the
part was fairly fast even on a two year old Intel i5 processor with a Hard Disk Drive (the one with
Spindles and Sectors and moving parts! I feel like these things have become so slow these days!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/837946185528684544&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2017-03-04-twitter-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One slight scare was when I restarted the computer while it was running from the
Live USB after having touched the GPT of the Hard Drive. This led to Grub (of
course) not finding the operating systems, and dropping me to a Grub2 shell
where the Flash Drive, which should have shown up as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hd1&lt;/code&gt; was not showing up.
Thankfully, I was able to get back into Bios using the designated key for my
laptop, and boot back up using the Flash Drive, if that had not been possible, I
don’t know what my way out would have been!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am yet to write the appropriate lines inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/crypttab&lt;/code&gt; to make sure that
the protected ext4 LUKS partitions are mounted at startup. That seems like an
easy process, atleast now that I have seen one SO question on it and done
nothing about it at all. I am pretty sure it’s not as easy as I think right now.
More on the tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Little Lies had some major progress today. I actually ended up getting
through 56% of the book! So, I am pretty into the story now. If you read
yesterday’s post, know that Celeste had a reason. I don’t want to spoil the
story again today by revealing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I hate Renata and Harper. Bonnie and her yogi thing and her vegan thing
that she’s converting Abigal into is also rather irritating. There’s an Orwell
line in one of his essays that fits perfectly for the present situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One may feel, as I do, a sort of aesthetic distaste for Bonnie, noe may reject
the claims of sainthood made on her behalf (she never made any such claim,
herself) by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Reflections on Gandhi (The name “Gandhi” replaced with “Bonnie”!)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 14 - MISSED; Age of Adaline, Backing up and nautilus ETAs</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/03/day-14"/>
   <updated>2017-03-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/03/day-14</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;ARGH! I succumbed to it. But now I am twice as determined as before to not miss
another day. (Technically, I am not missing yesterday because I am going to
write two posts at 2017-03-04 23:20 UTC+5.5. But I definitely missed posting
yesterday, and I am going to refuse to let that happen!) Also, this post is
going to be as if I wrote it last night, that’s the only sane way to write this
so that the series will make sense at a later time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the D-Day for the upgraded installation of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Atleast,
it should have been. But it didn’t work out! I couldn’t get the backups on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to copy about 27 GB + 1.5 GB data to different partitions on the main hard drive and an
external hard drive. I posted this series of tweets and pictures about my experience with the
copying thing. Basically, the estimates that Nautilus gave me were just plain wrong. &lt;em&gt;LIES, Jimmy,
LIES!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/837702801178271745&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2017-03-04-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I was watching Age of Adaline. It was such a great movie! The trailer
is pretty shady, with her not aging and all that, the beginning is a bit weird
considering the amount of story that is conveyed in voice-over. But as the movie
goes on and we get to know Adaline / Jenny well, and Harrison Ford comes into
the picture, their flashback etc, the movie gets really good! It’s one of those
movies that redeems itself as time goes on! I definitely wish I could have seen
that in a movie theater, I don’t know why, there weren’t a lot of &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; or
&lt;em&gt;theater screen&lt;/em&gt; worthy scenes or anything, but it just felt like the kind of
movie that would stick with you forever if you had seen it in a theatre. Like
Titanic. (Titanic stuck with everyone no matter where they saw it. Well, so much
for finding a good analogy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this backing up process was going on, I also managed to make significant
progress in Big Little Lies. I also saw that the episodes are literally being
released this week, there have been 2 or 3 already released and the remaining
will be released in the next few weeks! Now, I &lt;strong&gt;absolutely must&lt;/strong&gt; complete the
book this weekend and catch up on the series. Reese Witherspoon is absolutely
stunning in the first episode’s thumbnail (is she Celeste? God, that suspense is
different and almost equal to the suspense of who was murdered! That information
has been carefully hidden till now.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the Celeste thing in the book is so surprising! I never pegged her for the
kind of person who would plan years and years into the future. You know what I
am talking about, I bet there has to be a reason for that, right! A reason there
almost certainly has to be for her line “Once the boys have given their last
high-school exam, …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIG LITTLE LIES SPOILERS: YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celeste says that she will leave her husband Perry as soon as Max and Josh (her
twin sons) are done with high school! Why? No clue, I will wait for the reason
to be revealed!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 13 - Using Ansys Workbench, Tigo and Yelle</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/02/day-13"/>
   <updated>2017-03-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/02/day-13</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Very few times have I said that learning a new project has been fun! Today
definitely qualifies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to learn Ansys for something that I need to do for my bachelor’s and
master’s theses. Some simulations of loading conditions, and find out the
values of stress, where the values are maximum etc. There are two software
packages to do this: Abaqus and Ansys. Abaqus wouldn’t install, so I tried
Ansys, the instalation was a breeze! IIT Kharagpur has a License Server running
on the internal network, so there are no file installation keys etc. The
license is on the network, that’s GREAT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, switch to Windows 8, a 45 minute or so installation, 5 more minutes to
reboot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start Ansys Workbench, wander around it aimlessly for 30 minutes, accept that
you need help, go to Youtube and search “Ansys Workbench Tensile Test
Tutorial”, search for the right tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnpq5zzOS48&quot;&gt;this really really good
tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for Ansys Workbench
which is absolutely lucid, and doesn’t have one step that was skipped. And
there’s a voiceover guiding you what to do! These are the best tutorials!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, finally, after all that effort, I ended up being able to simulate a tensile
test on a Steel specimen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The animation feature is pretty nice to look at, and serves really well to put
here as my first real attempt at using Ansys:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-13-1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;131&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloudfare came out with their &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/quantifying-the-impact-of-cloudbleed&quot;&gt;official partial
post-mortem&lt;/a&gt;
of the Cloudbleed bug that affected them on 18th February, 2017. They were down
for a bit, their parser was broken. It’s a good read, and it’s pretty technical
heavy also, which I greatly appreciate. They are a great company, and I have
used their web dashboard for &lt;a href=&quot;https://metakgp.org&quot;&gt;metakgp.org&lt;/a&gt; where we use
Cloudfare to provide HTTPS to the users of our website, without having an SSL
certificate for our domain on the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two artists mentioned in the title are the people who’s songs that I will
share here today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TYfAWC-CDk8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still making insignificant progress in Big Little Liars, the three main
characters are now introduced and ready to get started with. By the way, it’s
not clear who has been murdered, Bonnie is alive. I hope it’s not one of these
three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: I know that Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon are in the TV
Adaptation of this book, and I tried to figure out who would be what character.
For now, I think Kidman is Celeste (from Jane’s description of Celeste when she
first sees her), and Reese is probably Jane (?). I still haven’t seen the
trailer or anything, so this is rather exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 12 - Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installation fails</title>
   <link href="/2017/03/01/day-12"/>
   <updated>2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/03/01/day-12</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I run an &lt;em&gt;ancient&lt;/em&gt; Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installation. I installed it in December
2014, and I have faced problems in between but I have almost always tried to fix
them without having to re-install the whole operating system because frankly,
re-installing an operating system is an unbelievably pain. These are the steps
that I can think of off-hand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accept the fact that you have to re-install your OS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start preparing for the re-install, search all the directories like
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Downloads&lt;/code&gt; for files that you can’t afford to delete&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out what files you want to Back-up depending on how much extra storage
you have. Almost everyone I know has exactly as much storage as they use. I
am included in that list, I have very less crawl space&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Back-up the files that you intended to back-up, make sure you don’t miss
anything. Doing it now, I have found that using a paper for this step greatly
eases the pain because then you don’t have to stare at your screen, strangely
comforting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the whole file-system once more, and take the plunge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WHOA WAIT! If you lose a file, it might be nice to know what you lost
atleast. So, let’s store the output to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tree /driveD&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tree /home/&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tree /driveO&lt;/code&gt; etc to a text file and back that up as well. This
unfortunately takes a &lt;em&gt;LOT LONGER&lt;/em&gt; then one would expect. I ran &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tree &amp;gt;
/dev/null&lt;/code&gt; on a 350 GB NTFS partition, and it took 25 minutes for that
command to complete executing. &lt;em&gt;Yup&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take the plunge. Forget everything that’s on the partitions you are going to
delete and over-write now, and create the Bootable USB&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restart to Windows and use Rufus or something to create the USB (because
nothing exists to create a Ubuntu Live USB that works with UEFI on Ubuntu,
how ironic)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restart, go to the Live USB. &lt;em&gt;START INSTALLATION&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s 9 steps to start the installation, partitioning etc are things to be
dealt with after. RIGHT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I come to the conclusion that a reinstall is long overdue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started Google Chrome and VLC after a routine restart. It didn’t work. It said
this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;VLC media player 2.2.4 Weatherwax &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;revision 2.2.3-37-g888b7e89&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;0000000000e241e8] core libvlc: Running vlc with the default interface. Use &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;cvlc&apos;&lt;/span&gt; to use vlc without interface.

&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;process:11885&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;: Gtk-WARNING &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;: Locale not supported by C library.
        Using the fallback &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;C&apos;&lt;/span&gt; locale.
vlc: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gtk-2.0/modules/liboverlay-scrollbar.so: undefined symbol: ubuntu_gtk_set_use_overlay_scrollbar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same with Google Chrome Stable. I wasn’t really shocked or anything to see this
error, I thought I could fix it. How naive I was, because this is not a common
error that has been faced by a lot of people before. This is an error few people
run into, and those who do, they never do fix it! A quick search proved that to
me. More digging solidifed the point, and made a reinstall inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the normal steps anyway: Removed the vlc, google-chrome-stable packages.
Did a complete &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get upgrade&lt;/code&gt; which downloaded about 380 MB of packages
and installed them. I then installed &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vlc&lt;/code&gt; and hoped it would work, it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now use Firefox for browsing. Youtube doesn’t work Firefox. I am really not in
any mood to debug that or figure it out. In my opinion, Youtube should just
work. There used to be an option at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://youtube.com/html5&lt;/code&gt; where you could
choose if you would prefer to use the Flash player or the HTML5 player, now they
have removed it and it automatically tries to use the HTML5 player. I don’t know
what’s going on here, and it’s extremely irritating that a basic website doesn’t
work on the default browser that’s shipped with Ubuntu. Distributions are
probably the reason Linux never made it big in the desktop market, it’s a sad
state of affairs. But anyway, I have decided to take the plunge, and the only
thing that remains now is the hope that somehow magically, the reinstall will go
through smoothly and my computer will emerge from the ashes (ah, such BS) with
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS being it’s new power horse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseNotes/&quot;&gt;Release Notes for Ubuntu 16.04
LTS&lt;/a&gt;, and I am surprised at
the amount of changes that have happened in this release. Now, I do feel as if I
should stay off the LTS versions, and instead go onto the 16.10 version and then
re-install every year. That would be a major pain, but if I could figure out
partitioning properly, and only have to over-write the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; (root) partition,
then this should be worth it. Probably not now, because I have to keep my
machine in Dual Boot despite not using Windows at all for other reasons (read
“National Instruments Drivers are only available for Windows”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently have the 3.13 kernel. That’s about 2 years old. I am pretty sure
that there were a lot of security issues and bugs that were patched in these two
years. There is most certainly a way to get the latest kernel without changing
your distribution. There has to be, right? Okay. Mental note: find out that
method and keep the kernel atleast on the latest stable build of the same major
version.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Information overload. There’s been a lot going on on the Internet today. (This
is just the last 1 hour of my time spent on Twitter reading up about “important
things”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This just broke, the color constancy thing. (This resurrects &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RoFlo/status/571130225884409856&quot;&gt;The
Dress&lt;/a&gt;. I saw Blue and
Black, re-tweeted this picture, and then I came back to copy the link, and I
saw White and Gold. OH GOD.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Color constancy came back exactly 1 year after The Dress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AkiyoshiKitaoka/status/836382313160171521&quot;&gt;The
Strawberries&lt;/a&gt;
have come to haunt us. Not a single Red pixel in this picture, and yet
everyone sees Red strawberries.

decided to write a great article on this! This is a great article.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You brain says, ‘the light source that I’m viewing these strawberries under
has some blue component to it, so I’m going to subtract that automatically
from every pixel.’ And when you take grey pixels and subtract out this blue
bias, you end up with red&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heroku is DOWN:&lt;/strong&gt; WHOA. I just found this when I ran a mundane &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku logs
--tail&lt;/code&gt; and realised that Heroku was down for the first time in my life. I
have never seen a major service Outage at Heroku. I have seen many at Github,
because they seem to go down so often ( :-( ) A few photos to commemorate
this momentous occasion (Not really.) From &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.heroku.com/incidents/1059&quot;&gt;Incident
1059&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-11-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;111&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-11-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;112&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://public-inbox.org/git/1488007487-12965-1-git-send-email-kannan.siddharth12@gmail.com/&quot;&gt;patch series to
git&lt;/a&gt;
which implements the “hyphen means previous branch” shorthand in log, and a
bunch of other commands is now in “Needs review”, as per this week’s “What’s
cooking in git.git” post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-11-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;113&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, patches that are in “Needs review” are reviewed by other maintainers
who track the “What’s cooking” messages and assign work to themselves! So, I can
expect to be waiting for review on my patch for the next couple weeks or so, and
also make changes to it and re-roll the patches in case someone feels that is
required. This is most certainly the easier part. Once this gets merged into
“next”, I would definitely like to post an “archive” of sorts of the way I took
to tackle this feature addition, and how I finally came down to the code that
got accepted into atleast “Needs review” status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. I realise that each day these posts are getting shorter and shorter. And
everyday, I hope, in vain, that the next day something incredibly interesting
would happen and I can write about it here at length. Not to be, not yet
atleast.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 10 - Tartt and Flynn - Some background, and their inspirations</title>
   <link href="/2017/02/27/day-10"/>
   <updated>2017-02-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/02/27/day-10</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ah, I am done with All the Missing Girls now! The ending was &lt;strong&gt;unexpected&lt;/strong&gt;. I
can’t really say anything else about it here without spoiling the book, so
that’s about everything that I can say of the book now. READ IT! The mystery is
too good, and understanding the whole thing is satisfying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I did some research about two authors that I have absolutely fallen
in love with after reading their first novel: Donna Tartt and Gillian Flynn. I
saw their interviews, read about what they had to say about their respective
books (Secret History and Gone Girl). I found this amazing
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a14563/inside-gone-girls-gillian-flynn/&quot;&gt;elle.com&lt;/a&gt;
article which is an interview with Flynn about her book, and this article is so
tastefully written. Nothing like the normal drab style in which most interviews
are written (Most of them are just Q and A type, with Q: … A: … without any
comments from the author at all, which make them feel like the transcript to a
video and hardly qualify as an article)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna Tartt worked for almost 8 years on Secret History, and that book was so
good. It was about 600 pages long (or longer) and her other two books are
actually longer. Goldfinch being about 770 pages long. I would love to read
these two and complete my Tartt experience, but frankly, it’s too big of a
commitment for now, and I can’t really make it. (Surprisingly, Tana French, who
writes books that have an eerie similarity to Tartt’s books, also writes books
that are large ~ about 400-430 pages.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tartt also said that she loved poetry and wanted to be a poet in a 1992
interview of her. She also mentioned Dickens as someone who’s writing influenced
her!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flynn’s background though is a bit more interesting. She worked for almost 10
years in Entertainment Weekly, writing God knows what (I couldn’t find her
articles with a cursory search, could dig more for sure), she then started
working on Sharp Objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At EW she could be up to her eyeballs in kiss kiss bang bang, but kiss kiss
bang bang at a remove, safely confined to the screen, dissipating once the
credits rolled and the lights came up. She stayed on staff for 10 years, writing
about movies and TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she was inspired to do so by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21671.Mystic_River&quot;&gt;Dennis Lehane’s Mystic
River&lt;/a&gt;. Yup, that is
certainly on my reading list now! While Sharp Objects was a fine book, it had a
good character list, the revelation at the end is ominous and I felt like it had
been looming over everyone for almost the whole book now, with how creepy that
particular character is, Dark Places was the REAL DEAL! In some ways, the
dysfunctional female lead in Dark Places was even more shocking and full of
promise compared to Amy Dunne, the psychopath from heaven. (That phrase should
mean something special).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking for the next book to read. I am going to go search for that now!
That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 9 - More thoughts about All the Missing Girls again.</title>
   <link href="/2017/02/26/day-9"/>
   <updated>2017-02-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/02/26/day-9</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ah, another slow day. Most of the time today I spent doing nothing or reading
All the Missing Girls. I am of course going to write atleast a paragraph about
the progress I have made in the book, because I went from Day 13 or something,
to the last three days: Day 3, 2 and 1, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book has really opened up. While in the beginning I thought that the writing
was so cliched with a lot of metaphors and sentences like “She was like that”,
“I was the monster”, etc, I am finally understanding what Nicolette really
feels like. One particular paragraph which I think is incredibly revealing for
her character is this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Change your hair, leave everyone behind. Go someplace new and never look back.
You can do it. We can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She thinks of this when she is talking with Everett about his life, and how he
is a lawyer but he might not really want to be. Nicolette did it once, she went
to a new place, she didn’t really look back until now when she is really
spending a lot more time here, and this has clearly destroyed her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her relationship with Corinne is also explored further in the part of the book
that I read today. Corinne is Alison, no doubt about that. She’s unapolegetic,
she believes she can have the world, she is mean and has a disturbed life at
home, she has a boyfriend who can barely keep up with her betrayals and
breaking-up and getting-back-together routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many key facts about their whole thing that is laid out in front of
the reader. So, if you are reading this book and are feeling disoriented after
about 100-130 pages into the book, know that it gets better and the story gets
easier to understand and put together. Sidenote: It’s one hell of a confusing
book, the reverse chronological narration totally disorients even people who
have read non-linear story lines like Catch-22. So, brace yourselves. This book
requires a lot of attention. From the Elle review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are you paying attention? You’ll need to be; this thriller will test your
brain with its reverse chronological structure, and it’s a page-turner to boot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elle.com/culture/books/news/g28322/9-best-books-to-read-in-june/&quot;&gt;this
article&lt;/a&gt;,
which I had to use Google to find. Sometimes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ddg.gg&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; just
can’t. They get A for effort, and a HUGE HUGE A+ shoutout for dropping my use of
Google so much. I appreciate the fact that they are working on this, and I hope
I can donate to them soon. If you don’t already use
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ddg.gg&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;, you should start right away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm, that seems like it. I have been thinking about what to write for a few
minutes now, and there’s nothing, so that’s it. Tomorrow might be better!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 8 - mfqp, mfqp-source, Alison from Pretty Little Liars</title>
   <link href="/2017/02/25/day-8-mfqp-mfqp-source-alison-PLL"/>
   <updated>2017-02-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/02/25/day-8-mfqp-mfqp-source-alison-PLL</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;SATURDAY! Ah, the weekend is here. I am not terribly excited &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the
weekend, as much as I am about the fact that it is FINALLY here. The last week
was mid-terms, and then three days of project work and classes and the routine
sinking back in. So, a bit hectic, huh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I will talk about this project that I have been working on for about 10
months now. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/metakgp/mfqp-source&quot;&gt;mfqp-source&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/metakgp/mfqp&quot;&gt;mfqp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, mfqp is a previous year question paper search platform. It was built by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amrav&quot;&gt;@amrav&lt;/a&gt;. mfqp-source is a way to crowd source
question papers from the students who are giving exams in IIT Kharagpur, and get
it online, so that people in the future can look at those papers and prepare a
little bit better then they actually would have in case they didn’t have the
papers. Also, it’s just easier to prepare for an exam here, if you know what
&lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of questions are asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mfqp-source was started by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nuwandavek&quot;&gt;Vivek Aithal&lt;/a&gt;, and I
took it up as a pet project of mine because I loved the idea and wanted to work
with something like this: It’s challenging because people don’t behave like you
want them to, it required structure because that’s the only way we could sift
through the hundreds of email we were sure to recieve, and it would involve
writing scripts that would work with Gmail and some cloud hosting platform to
host the crowd-sourced papers. So, I took it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working on it for the past two semesters, and we have gotten a lot
of papers on mfqp. It’s being used by a lot of people on campus as the way to
get the question papers! That’s great! In the 2 weeks leading up to the past mid
term exam session, there were a total of about 6500 sessions, by about 2700
users. (6583 sessions and 2787 users) I just looked up the figures as I was
writing this post, so it’s a surprise for me too, and these figures are pretty
good! (on a campus with a total of about 10,000 people which includes
technicians, professors, Research Scholars, masters students &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bachelors
students)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that was about the project and the reach. The idea for this project, atleast
in the beginning was to provide a live view of the papers that have been
contributed by everyone and build some kind of a goal and then work towards
that. That became pretty hard, pretty fast. We tried to keep up, but it was just
too much work and no one could keep up, so that was eventually dropped, and it
just became a project to parse everything that was sent to us, create pdfs,
rename it properly and then upload it to drive, and add the link of the file
alongwith it’s particulars to MFQP. That was a lot easier to do and I have been
keeping up with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm, so that was some free material to write about. I read a bit more of All the
Missing Girls today. Finally, a little bit more was revealed about Corinne.
She’s definitely the alpha-female, loyalty-hungry character that Alison is in
Pretty Little Liars (I endured the show for 4 seasons until I got really really
really bored with it, I wish I had read the books first though). I don’t know
what it is with characters like Alison and books like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books like Girls on Fire (Wasserman), The Girls (Cline), Dark Places (Flynn),
all of these books have a similar character, but not exactly her. The main
difference being that Corinne and Alison are the leaders of their posse, and
they are not charming or charismatic, what they are is irritating. They listen
to their (generally not good looking or somehow inferior) friends and rack up
the secrets that they have to tell them, and then use those secrets against the
very girls that treated them like living Gods. It’s the last part that really
pisses me off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it’s rather premature to pass a judgement on Corinne I think. The quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You had to keep proving your loyalty to her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that Nicolette says makes it clear that she wasn’t an easy person to be friends
with, but I still guess there’s a wee bit of leeway for Corinne to be something
like Diondra and less like Alison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Sasha Pieterse does an incredible job playing this stupidly irritating
character, so maybe the show Alison is as irritating and hateful as she is
simply because Pieterse played her so well! I SOOOOO wonder what my thoughts
about Alison would have been if only I had read the books first.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 7 - Veep, Different ways to narrate a story in books</title>
   <link href="/2017/02/24/day-7-veep-narration-techniques-books"/>
   <updated>2017-02-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/02/24/day-7-veep-narration-techniques-books</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Um, 7 days and already I don’t have anything to talk about from today. I didn’t
do a lot today, worked on my bachelor’s project for about 3 hours in the
afternoon, a 2 hour class before that, and nothing before that really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched the fourth season of Veep, hence reaching the point where the race is
literally tied between Selina and O’Brien. Which means season 5 should be pretty
good fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 9th episode which was the one with only the hearings in it, well, that was
perhaps the best episode in the TV series! There were so many jokes in it, with
Jonah and Richard Splett and the whole hearing with Amy’s dress and the
Congresswoman. It was absolutely hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have said a few things about that, I need to talk about something
else again. I started reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23212667-all-the-missing-girls&quot;&gt;All the Missing Girls - Megan
Miranda&lt;/a&gt;
yesterday, and I am about 60 pages into that book, and it is okay till now.
Nothing major happened yet, or maybe it did, I didn’t feel like anything major
happened yet. There are a few things about narration of stories in books that I
have learned over the past year that I have been continously reading books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some books which are narrated linearly, in the forward direction.
There are no shenanigans here, the book starts on day 1 of the story, the
premise is set, the story happens, and there’s a climax (well, usually there is
a climax). There are a lot of good examples of this. Personally, I love books
that create characters that are bigger than the story. It doesn’t matter where
in the story the characters fit, but what the characters are and how they are
going to propel the story forward. The seminal book in this matter is most
certainly Secret History by Donna Tartt. Funnily enough, I finished reading this
book on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1470325810&quot;&gt;December 24, 2015&lt;/a&gt;,
exactly one year and two months ago. I still remember it. I have remembered it
throughout the year, I have raved about it to a lot of people at a lot of times,
I have also talked about Henry and Camille (who is one of my favourite book
characters) to everyone I know. That’s the kind of book and character that I
want to read when I am reading a linear book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other good examples in the Psychothriller genre are Gone Girl and A Girl On
The Train, both books were properly narrated in the normal fashion. No
shenanigans, and no weird cannons on the narrating technique. I would say both
of them turned out fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other way to tell a story is to tell it non-linearly, forward or backward,
it doesn’t matter. You jump from places and points in time to other places at
other points in time. It’s incredibly disconcerting, and generally, it’s not
worth the effort of keeping up unless it’s 1. really well written or 2. the
story or characters or both have gotten you absolutely hooked. Catch-22 is a
good example. I will be being rather honest when I say that I didn’t really
enjoy that book because it was full of crazy people, people who had gone
bat-shit crazy from having been at war for too long. There was not one sane
person in the whole book by the end of the book. That’s not something that I
like to read about, I read it anyway, because I had to read a book that was so
popular and lauded by everyone. It’s narration was non-linear. Things happened,
the first 200 pages hardly have made sense to anyone. Eventually, the loops
start closing and the story starts to make sense, but then the craziness getst o
you. Read at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present book All the Missing Girls is actually neither of these.
Theoretically, (atleast from my knowledge of math), it is a linear book. It goes
1 day at a time, but in the backward direction. Essentially, it is something
like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144&quot;&gt;Memento&lt;/a&gt;. I want to say Fight Club,
but I am not really sure I should because that was not really backwards, that
was definitely more on the non-linear side. She has gone through the events of
Day 1. Something happens on the night of Day 1 and the lead player, Nicolette,
which is a fantastic character name by the way, loses it. Then, we are shown Day
15, then Day 14, and so on, until we wind back down to the night of Day 1 and
what happened which triggered it all off. I am curious to see how she is going
to manage to hide as much as she can about the events of that first day. It will
be interesting to see!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(P.S. I don’t know anything about books or literature or anything of that sort
except for what I learned from reading a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/44525691-siddharth?shelf=read&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;few&lt;/em&gt;
books&lt;/a&gt;. So,
you should probably not take into account any of that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1470325810&quot;&gt;I do
hope&lt;/a&gt; that you had fun reading
about it and were inspired into reading Secret History as I was by this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/369399784&quot;&gt;amazing
review&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um, so that’s about 800 words. I can’t really muster up anything else from
today, because honestly I didn’t do anything worthy of writing about at all! I
guess I should try to put more effort into this. Perhaps, I should end with 2
scenic photos of this new lab that I am going to be working at for my bachelor’s
thesis, and the road that leads to this lab:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 6 - SHA-1 broken, TRAPPIST-1 has planets, Homeland 6.5 - EPIC EPISODE!</title>
   <link href="/2017/02/23/day-6-sha1-collision-homeland-6-5-trappist-1-system"/>
   <updated>2017-02-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/02/23/day-6-sha1-collision-homeland-6-5-trappist-1-system</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well well well. That was an eventful day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just learned from an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0xabad1dea/status/834802038303236097&quot;&gt;@eevee tweet&lt;/a&gt; that
SHA-1 collision was generated. That was about 40 minutes ago. Before that, another tweet told me
showed me the cute gif that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GoogleDoodles/status/834574707915644929&quot;&gt;Google
made&lt;/a&gt; for the TRAPPIST-1 discovery. All
of this was right after I had just seen Homeland S06E05. I love the episode. I raved about it on
Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/834802184462098432&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2017-02-23-twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-6-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;day61&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHA-1 collision was on it’s way, I guess? Chrome had already almost deprecated
SHA-1 certificates, and apparently Root CAs were no longer allowed to issue
SHA-1 only certificates. So, this should probably not affect stuff as much. Git
should definitely be affected. I have read Linus say that even if there was ever
a SHA-1 collision that happened, then Git would handle it just fine. Discussion
about this has &lt;a href=&quot;https://public-inbox.org/git/CA+55aFxjY7mv7YPLZwit7bEhC3VqpEDk1YSRFwSGOEKVw13x4w@mail.gmail.com/T/#me181023a3dfe30d4b76880f0c883c4f90a5a879d&quot;&gt;already
started&lt;/a&gt;
on the git mailing list, which I am following closely because I am trying to get
&lt;a href=&quot;https://public-inbox.org/git/1486299439-2859-1-git-send-email-kannan.siddharth12@gmail.com/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://public-inbox.org/git/1486752926-12020-1-git-send-email-kannan.siddharth12@gmail.com/&quot;&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://public-inbox.org/git/1487258054-32292-1-git-send-email-kannan.siddharth12@gmail.com/&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;
merged in! This is the first time that I am working with the Git community, and
they are really good! I have had email exchanges with Junio (who is the
maintainer) and also with Matthieu Moy who commented on almost all of my
patches! I am glad that I am able to contribute to something that I use daily,
and make some kind of a significant and meaningful contribution to (g)it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have studied (in a course last semester: Cryptography and Network Security)
about the internals of DES, AES, SPN Networks (which form the basics of modern
Block Ciphers). I know about TLS and HTTPS because I obsessed over it. I would
like to mention Robert Heaton’s brilliant &lt;a href=&quot;http://robertheaton.com/2014/03/27/how-does-https-actually-work/&quot;&gt;blog
post&lt;/a&gt; on the
matter. (Also see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0opakLwtPWk&quot;&gt;@filippo’s talk about TLS
1.3&lt;/a&gt; and why it is awesome. This is
apparently pretty close to being a RFC and eventually being implemented on
servers). I am also studying about more security proof stuff: IND-CPA, IND-CCA,
etc this semester in another course: Foundations of Cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing that’s missing from my arsenal is knowledge about the contruction
of 1-way hash functions. I have tried reading the RFC for SHA-1, and although I
kind-of understood it, I still need to understand it more completely. There’s
one more thing added to my “read up about” list. (Kidding, I don’t have any such
list, creating one should make sense though)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing: TRAPPIST-1. I don’t know much about this, except for the
distance that really registered in my head: 40 light years. That’s huge, and
basically, what we are seeing now was happening at these planets 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-6-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;day62&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, that’s one generation of life! Imagine if someone could see (but not
change) what we were doing 40 years ago, and think about how they would have
felt about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or better still, what if someone watched what we are doing right now, 40 years
from now. For simiplicity, you should probably assume that it is human beings
who don’t have any clue about anything, but somehow live 40 light-years from
Earth) Yeah, it is all pretty weird and intriguing and scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing that I really wanted to talk about was Homeland 6.5. It is
seriously the best episode that I have seen them make in a long long time. The
last time I felt this way was in Season 1 or Season 2. When Carrie and Brody and
Quinn and Saul and Dar were at the top of their games. Now, only Dar seems to be
at the top of his game, because Saul just confided in Dar. And from the trailer
scene of Dar going into the room for a meeting and saying “No Saul?” and someone
replying “No Saul”, it seems like he’s going to do something to get him out of
his way so that Keane can’t be around any sane person except for Carrie and Rob
(who seems really weird for a Chief of Staff, he never seems to be around any of
the staff that he’s supposed to chief of! So unlike Amy from Veep)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feeling that you get from Franny and Quinn’s first interaction scene
together is soooo good! And the irony of it all is that Quinn wasn’t doing
anything bad at all, he was doing exactly what Carrie would have done in a
similar situation. Would Carrie have shot that guy on her front porch? Probably
not. She would have certainly gone out and rationally convinced everyone there
that they were being class A A-holes, and they should stop doing whatever they
were upto. (which was intimidating a women in a house alone with a daughter for
saving a guy who is now a suspect. Oh.  Okay, maybe the intimidating thing isn’t
right)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I am watching Veep too. Mainly for Julia Louis-Dreyfus whom I love because
of Seinfeld.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 5 - Linux, Pendrives and Encryption!</title>
   <link href="/2017/02/22/day-5-linux-pendrives-encryption"/>
   <updated>2017-02-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/02/22/day-5-linux-pendrives-encryption</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The paranoia of having your hard drive crash on you is devastating, once it
bites you. It’s the fatality and the irreversibility of it. Once a hard drive
has crashed on you, the only thing that you can do, is take the computer to some
repair place, and have the hard drive changed (or if you are sure it’s the hard
drive, order a new one online and replace it yourself). Nonetheless, the data
that you had is gone. Generally, people say &lt;strong&gt;Backup your data and keep it in a
safe place&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that for most people, the hard drives that you do have just do
the job. There’s never enough to have 2 copies of anything. If you had that much
space, you probably would have a hard drive that’s more reliable and you would
not have to be as paranoid. Anyway, I think you see where I am heading with
this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few files on your system that are absolutely important. Files which
when lost will wreak havoc in your life for a brief period of time, and when
stolen will cause a lot more problems in a lot of other people’s lives too. I
can only think of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RSA keys inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.ssh&lt;/code&gt;: Added in Github, Gitlab, the like. Also on servers
  that you might want to SSH into. If these servers host a website, well.
  There’s a lot of trouble that a non-sudo user can create. (Fork Bomb)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PGP keys inside the keyring, accessed through &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gpg&lt;/code&gt; Android signing keystores,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.jks&lt;/code&gt; files. Losing these will mean that you can’t
  upload APKs to your Google Playstore app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you use something like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mutt&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;msmtp&lt;/code&gt;, then the Gmail App Passwords are
  stored in plaintext as 600 files. No one else can read them, but if they are
  stolen, that user can certainly read them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the list might be a bit longer. But the above should be enough to
demonstrate my previous paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the simplest way to get around all of this, is to use Github / Gitlab
extensively. They provide a lot of free space, and can be used to host code,
small files, folders that have project work, etc etc. But what about the private
stuff? The private keys, the keystores?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where a flash drive comes in. A flash drive that has everything stored on
it. But wait a minute: creating this small device that has all these files that
you don’t want to be stolen on it? you MUST encrypt it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had not done that till now. I was lucky enough for significantly bad things to
not happen to me because of this flash drive being stolen. (I even took it once
to a shop to print something out! Unbelievably stupidity!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu makes creating encrypted flash drives incredibly simple. You can use a
GUI for the most part!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concise version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sh apt-fast install gparted gparted /dev/sdb # create two partitions. FAT32
in the beginning of the space, # ext4 at the end of the space&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, open the Disks Utility, and format and create a LUKS + EXT4 system on the
last partition. This will prompt you for a password, and that’s it! That was 2
steps! Incredibly easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, the pen drive works on Linux, as well as on Windows! (Because most of
the world uses Windows, and more often than not, you are going to have to
transfer files from Linux to Windows.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows throws an ugly error when it realises that the pendrive has an Ext4
healthy partition that it can’t read, and says you must “Install software that
can do that”, and I think there are Ext4 partition readers for Windows. I have
no intention to install or use them. I went into Windows only to test that FAT32
works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part was easy. This is how it looked inside Nautilus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-5-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;day-5-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that LUKS + EXT4 will natively work only on Linux based
systems. LUKS stands for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup&quot;&gt;Linux Unified Key
Setup&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t know what
kind of encryption it uses, I intend to find out. Also,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup&quot;&gt;PBKDF2&lt;/a&gt;, this is the
function that is used everywhere. It’s used in LibreOffice documents, it’s used
in LastPass, it looks simple, but reading up on it’s security and any analysis
of that should be interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second project for the day that I had ambitiously decided to take up was to
create a bootable pendrive with persistent storage. Because honestly, Live CDs
without persistent storage are so useless! I am not going to have internet all
the time, and I am not going to have time to install vim, and my dotfiles, and
all that each time I login at a new computer, where I probably want to quickly
get something done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the surface, this seemed like a really simple thing. I would simply get a
pocket Linux distribution of my liking. Damn Small Linux, PocketLinux, Pen Drive
Linux, Slax there were a few options to choose from. I chose DSL. It didn’t
work. I did go through a set of absurd and comic situations to figure that out
though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the instructions on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/wiki/installing_to_a_usb_flash_drive.html&quot;&gt;DSL Wiki page for
installation&lt;/a&gt;.
It was a detailed instruction set, that repeatedly told me that if I didn’t use
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fdisk&lt;/code&gt; correctly, I would be in a big mess. Thanks for telling me that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, soon I found out that the USB had a GNU Partition Table, SysLinux was
the bootloader, and it apparently didn’t support EFI. Because the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/efi&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/boot/efi&lt;/code&gt; directory, one of those, was simply missing! My computer is also
GPT, has a Grub bootloader, and UEFI boot. (UEFI is like BIOS, but better. A lot
more robust, can handle more number of operating systems, and some such!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me about 2 hours to realise that this was not going to work. Apart from
SysLinux, Grub was the other choice that was mentioned on the wiki, and there
were “notes” in that section saying “It doesn’t work in some cases”. So, clearly
that wasn’t going to work for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I had to dump all of this and get back to Elementary OS Freya. It’s
a great distribution which I used without Persistent storage on a pendrive for
some time whenever I went out. I stopped taking my laptop everywhere, and it
made a lot of sense. Until I was fed up of installing everything again and
again, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, Ubuntu doesn’t have one single reliable UEFI + FAT32 Live USB
creator for Linux. That, for some reason, is incredibly amusing to me! I finally
had to go back to Windows, and use Rufus, which worked perfectly! How weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My forward plan is simple: I am going to find a small Linux distribution that
supports UEFI, I am going to create a Live USB of it. I want a protected setup,
so I will either have to use a LUKS + EXT4 partition for persistent data
(because Live USBs don’t have accounts or protection of that sort).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is somewhere between a bad tutorial on creating encrypted partitions
on pendrives and a rant about Ubuntu not having a good UEFI startup disk
creator. (The inbuilt one doesn’t work, I choose the ISO and it doesn’t do
anything after that. Tuxboot live creator is another program which I hoped would
work, but it doesn’t work even with distributions that support UEFI, like
Elementary)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 4 - Books made into Movies</title>
   <link href="/2017/02/21/day-4-books-made-into-movies"/>
   <updated>2017-02-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/02/21/day-4-books-made-into-movies</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I didn’t do anything today. I woke up, ate breakfast, prepared for the exam I
had, gave the exam from 2 pm - 4 pm, then came back and watched Veep for about 2
hours (time that I should probably have used to read this new book that I got.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23212667-all-the-missing-girls&quot;&gt;All the Missing Girls by Megan
Miranda&lt;/a&gt;.
This book is supposed to be a mix of The Girl On The Train (Hawkins) which is
now also a movie. The movie was great, although the narration could have been a
little bit less book-like. They literally copied the chapter names over, put
them on the screen, showed us their perspective. The movie was underwhelming in
general, I don’t know why I kept expecting more. OH!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, I was struggling to find something to write about today. This was
precisely why I started this, to force myself to think for about 30 minutes each
day. And I hit on this! “Books made into Movies”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental problem/gift (depending on how you look at it) with this kind of
an approach is that a non-creative rendition of my thoughts and aspirations and
what-not can only be kept up for so long. Definitely a lot less than 100 days,
so eventually I am going to have to come up with some creative thing that I can
talk about. Or, take the easier way out, and &lt;em&gt;do something&lt;/em&gt; that I can talk
about! Both these outcomes are totally agreeable for me, and that’s what my aim
with this thing is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, to the topic at hand. &lt;em&gt;Books made into movies&lt;/em&gt;. I have two specific
experiences that are very different and worth talking about. A disclaimer here
is that I loved all the books that I am going to talk about. So there might be a
slight bias where I support the book and the author a lot more than I do the
script-writer and the director and the producer of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common theme in all these books is that they are of the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/44525691-siddharth?shelf=psycho-thriller&quot;&gt;psychological-thriller&lt;/a&gt;
variety.  I like this genre a lot and have read a few books that fall inside
this genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gone-girl&quot;&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the movie first, and then, recently, last December or thereabouts, I read
the bo.  I like this genre a lot and have read a few books that fall inside this
genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gone-girl-1&quot;&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the movie first, and then, recently, last December or thereabouts, I read
the book. Definitely, I like the book a lot better. But I will also proudly
claim that throughout the book, Ben Affleck was the book Nick Dunne as well for
me. His casting was perfect: handsome, can pull off a writer (Affleck can
probably pull off any character though!), and tall. Rosamund Pike was the cold
and calculating book Amy Dunne for me too. Her casting again was so to-the-point
and expected: pretty, shady enough to rouse suspicion, NYC enough to pull off
the cocky attitutde once she moves back to Nick’s hometown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the book just because it was so much more intimate. I really got to know
the characters. Characters that I had loved from watching and re-watching the
Gone Girl movie, after absolutely falling in love with it since the first time I
watched it when I was holding my breath until the revelation is made! I
understood why Amy didn’t like coming back, I understood why Nick is definitely
not as good as he is portrayed in the book, in fact, I actually felt that he
isn’t all good, it was a feeling I had when I was reading the book. I don’t know
why I had it, and I don’t what to pin-point it on now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1458734842?book_show_action=false&amp;amp;from_review_page=1&quot;&gt;my
review&lt;/a&gt;
although enlightening, doesn’t talk about Nick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, intimacy with the characters. That’s the thing that did it for me. If I can
really get to know Amy and Nick and Go, then I can understand why it happened
and I can understand whether they will ever be able to come out of it. (which I
don’t think is possible)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last quote from Gone Girl, this was also in the movies and is insane:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What are you thinking, Amy? How are you feeling? Who are you? What havbe we
done to each other? What will we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dark-places&quot;&gt;Dark Places&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Gillian Flynn book. I read the book way before I even knew a movie
existed. When I finally saw the movie, it was a major disappointment. There is
one scene in my head, that was stuck there ever since I read about it in the
book. It’s the scene in which Ben colors his hair black and comes to the
breakfast table, and his mom tells him to remove his hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone at the table is a red-head except for Ben. Libby is the only one who
doesn’t freak out and thinks it looks good on Ben, the others completely freak
out! The elder two are screaming and crying and hysteric, almost. The mother is
almost close to tears, she questions her own behaviour over the past few days
and blames herself for this &lt;em&gt;ghastly&lt;/em&gt; thing that Ben has done to himself. All of
this is from reading a book. The movie, what can I say, either they didn’t want
to play this up or just plain missed it. The movie scene was so sober, it was a
big build-up that I hoped would be amazing. It was not. If you have read the
book, get this movie and watch this scene, you will understand what &lt;em&gt;true
disappointment&lt;/em&gt; is. (Kidding, it’s bad, but not as bad as I make it sound in the
last paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from this, Trey is an Indian dude who is extremely shady, hangs out with
Diondra and Ben, and also happens to be rich enough to be eccentric and crazy.
His casting was okay, I guess (?), because I was expecting him to be a humongous
tall fit man, around whom, Ben would be considered nothing more than a teenage
boy. He’s not that huge, and doesn’t really appear much in the movie at all,
except for a few scenes with Diondra and Ben.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie was a major disappointment, and it was mainly because except for
Diondra and Krissi Cates, every other character’s role seemed to be diminished
and not as much as I hoped it would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This could also all be explained by saying that I got too carried away by the
book and had really high expectations. Not sure if that is legit though.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that’s all I am going to talk about today. When doing something like
“100DaysOfWriting”, it’s all about pace. If I spend too much time on today’s
post, it will become a habit and the cost of doing this will increase and I
don’t intend for that to happen. So, talking about “The Girl On The Train” is
going to have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 3 - Rachmaninoff; "Someday" lists on your iPhone</title>
   <link href="/2017/02/20/day-3-rachmaninoff-someday-lists"/>
   <updated>2017-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/02/20/day-3-rachmaninoff-someday-lists</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The two topics for today’s post are completely unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write this to the background music of the second movement of Piano Concerto
no. 2 by Sergei Rachmaninoff, played by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRi1smZ9Il8&quot;&gt;Alexandre
Tharaud&lt;/a&gt;. This is such an amazing
piece of classical music. I play the piano, I am rather an amateur at it under
Classical Piano playing skills and standards, but I have atleast heard Classical
music to some extent, and this particular concerto (much like Mozart’s Early
Symphonies, which I will eventually have to talk about because I am running out
of things to write about. This exercise will certainly end up making me creative
at the very least, I hope) is by far Rachmaninoff’s most famous work. I saw this
lecture on this piano concerto by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPETreJpx2o&quot;&gt;Paul
Davies&lt;/a&gt; and it was so enlightening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a piece of classical music, which means that it has an inherent
structure (I learned from this lecture) that was considered to be appropriate
for concertos in the time that this piece was composed. And Rachmaninoff tried
to deviate from it a bit in the first movement by accompanying the orchestra
himself, instead of playing the major parts himself. AMAZING!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite parts of this piece are in decreasing order the subtle piano at the
beginning of the second movement, the ill-fate-predicting chords at the very
beginning of the first movement and the flute (?) part that plays on top of the
piano in the second movement starting at around 1:10 in the version played by
Tharaud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, why am I talking about all of this? Because I wanted to understand
classical piano music. It doesn’t have lyrics, it doesn’t have a &lt;em&gt;music video&lt;/em&gt;,
but it is music nonetheless and certainly wants to convey some meaning. The
change in tempo in each of the movements, the very separation of the piece into
movements, and the interaction between the pianist (the main act) and the
orchestra (the accompanying, sometimes main, act), all of this perhaps holds a
deeper meaning. I wish to someday understand what that means, I wish to someday
listen to Piano Concerto no. 2 or one of Mozart’s symphonies or the Hungarian
Rhapsody and understand the pain / jubilation / conflict that the composer felt
when he was composing that piece!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that leads me nicely into the next thing that I intend to talk about in this
post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-3-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;day-3-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Someday&lt;/strong&gt; list on all TODO List managing applications. A lot of people
have this kind of a list somewhere: Trello, Evernote, iOS Notes, Google Docs, or
a diary in which they have written down a bucket list that is a list of the
things that they want to do &lt;em&gt;someday&lt;/em&gt;. When will this someday come? No clue.
Will you know that this someday has come and gone if it does present itself?
Doubtful. Why did you file something inside &lt;em&gt;Someday&lt;/em&gt;? Oh, now, that’s easy. I
filed it there &lt;em&gt;because I can’t do it now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you can’t do it now, why do you happen to think that you might be able to
do it someday? Um. Oh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the fictional conversation that I had with myself when I realised that
I was going to add a card inside this Someday list. And that was exactly what
stopped me from adding a card there. If I obsess over something because I want
to do it and I haven’t written it down anywhere, I haven’t put it anywhere for
safekeeping, I feel that there is a larger chance of my going out there and
doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare that to the secure feeling I have when I file something I want to do in
the Someday list and forget all about it until I finally decide, one fine
afternoon when I am incredibly bored, to scroll over to that list and the flame
is re-kindled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, I came up with the counter argument to this too! What about when
people say that the best way to do something is to get started. Write stuff
down, start planning, start marking out dates on the calender, start counting
down to the D-Day. Well, then, put that in the &lt;em&gt;DO IN THE NEXT MONTH&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;DO
IN THE NEXT 6 MONTHS&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;DO THIS YEAR&lt;/em&gt; lists. NOT in the Someday list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is indeed something that I want to do. There are many loose ends whcih are
slightly related to the this thing right now, and I want to tie them all up
before I start planning this. I am pretty sure that this is a great way to
procrastinate. Because I am excited and nervous and scared and a little bit more
scared to start planning it and take concrete steps towards doing it. Once I
take those steps, I would have reached the:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 2 - A book and a movie</title>
   <link href="/2017/02/19/day-2-books-and-a-movie"/>
   <updated>2017-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/02/19/day-2-books-and-a-movie</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I completed reading Down and Out in Paris and London today. It’s a book by
George Orwell. I am yet to write a review on Goodreads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a good book, I plan to give it a 5/5. Mainly because it had some really
profound lessons on poverty, not &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; poverty, but on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; poor people get by,
and why the motivations behind why people continue to remain poor and how
society treats poor people, and how poor people treat each other. It’s like the
unwritten rule book of poverty in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-2-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;day-2-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a lot of time for me to finish this book. It was a 200 page book and the
primary reason I read it was that it was from Orwell and I wanted to read a book
of his that isn’t a dystopia because I find his dystopias to be extremely
depressing (the two of them: 1984 and Animal Farm, seminal dystopias!) The
secondary reason was that it was only 200 pages and although I like long books
that build up the characters to the point of loving him/her a lot, they are
involved and require a significant amount of commitment over a few weeks, if you
are in the middle of a crowded semester. And it was totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s in Paris for half the book and England for the rest of the book and it’s
not the late 20th century Europe where Paris is the capital of ramance and
London is the capital of … Um, capital of politeness or something? I don’t
really know how exactly London is shown in today’s books and TV shows but it’s
definitely polite and the British accent makes concentrating on the rest of the
frame hard. It is rather the Paris as inhabited by the poorest of the poor.
Living on a pound for a week, lodging houses instead of hotels,
tea-and-two-slices instead of elaborate English breakfasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a good book, read it if you have a week or two to spare. Or just a long
flight (&lt;strong&gt;Trivia:&lt;/strong&gt; I think I can read about 30 pages in one hour. I am not sure
if that’s exactly my reading speed, and I don’t want to be sure about it either,
I know there might probably be a test out there to check that. I have seen
Goodreads reviews of people saying that they completed a 250 page book in 3
hours. To read that fast must be amazing!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading that book, I prepared for the exam I have tomorrow. It’s my fourth
mid-term exam, the previous three were &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;. I hope tomorrow’s one goes fine
as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after dinner, I watched the movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2053463/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot;&gt;Side Effects
(2013)&lt;/a&gt;. Jude Law’s
character is great. About 1 hour into the movie, the story is almost at an end,
and Dr. Banks (Jude Law’s character) is grappling with his own life, ironically
he is a psychiatrist, and is almost coming apart trying to figure out whether he
engineered or played a part in the play that was just enacted out. And then, the
movie really gets started. Rooney Mara and Vinessa Shaw both put on a stellar
act, apart from Jude Law and … . Okay, saying who that was would be a spoiler
because the very fact that her character is important will propel you to a line
of thinking that might ruin the movie. (Not really, but I don’t want to take
chances!) And as a side note, although I am no judge of this because I know
nothing about it, the camera focusing thing in this movie was amazing! A lot of
the shots are close-ups of Emily Taylor (Mara’s character), and a lot of her
shots start with focus beside her and on an object that’s far away or a
completely unfocused shot and they eventually focus on her face. That’s so good
to look at!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting story here though, the story of how I ended up at this
movie. I googled (I don’t use Google as my go-to search engine, but sometimes
DuckDuckGo doesn’t cut it and then you must use Google. Why don’t I use Google?
One link: https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity ) for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Movies like Contagion&lt;/code&gt;
because I think that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot;&gt;Contagion
(2011)&lt;/a&gt; is one movie
that’s heavily under-rated. It’s a GREAT MOVIE. It’s such a GREAT MOVIE! I have
watched it twice in the past 6 months, and that’s plainly because the whole
movie is so well written and so well shot. The technical discussion parts are
interesting and not bland-and-dull per the usual Hollywood movie rhetoric at
all. (I think I didn’t use the word &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rhetoric&lt;/code&gt; right in that sentence).
Fishburne and Damon pull of great characters with ease. Incidentally, Jude Law
plays a manipulator in that movie as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after Contagion, the Google search that I had to do was to get the name of
this one book that I remember reading which had one man who had a … That won’t
make sense, I can’t explain it. I searched for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;book with underground lab and
one man with the button to not destroy it&lt;/code&gt; and found that the name of the book
was Andromeda Strain (I remembered that it was written by Crichton). The
particularly fascinating theory in this book is called the &lt;em&gt;Odd Man Hypothesis&lt;/em&gt;,
basically a set of scientists go to an underground high-tech lab that houses a
really bad virus, and in case things go wrong, then the lab will be destroyed
using some sort of a nuclear weapon. And the Odd Man, Dr. Mark Hall in this
case, will have a switch that can prevent this from happening. There is a great
scene in the book in which Hall is under the impression that pressing the switch
will actually destory the place and then someone explains to him that on the
contrary, pressing the switch will in fact stop the place from being destroyed.
There’s a revelation right at the end of the book (another spoiler :( ) which
leads to the lab being destroyed using a nuclear bomb being worse than doing
nothing at all, so Hall has a huge sequence where he has to go and press the
button. It’s a great book. No clue why I remembered it suddenly and felt the
need to find the name of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POST #2 is OVER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S This post is longer than yesterday’s post, there’s nothing creative about
this post at all (I feel), it’s just a collection of my thoughts throughout the
day. I am pretty sure this is how it is going to be. It is 23:58 now. Must
commit and push for this to be today’s post in the next 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 1 - Why write and The Unreserved (movie)</title>
   <link href="/2017/02/18/day-1-begin"/>
   <updated>2017-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2017/02/18/day-1-begin</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The 100 day project. This is what it says on &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days&quot;&gt;the
website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a celebration of process that encourages everyone to participate in 100
days of making. The great surrender is the process; showing up day after day is
the goal. For the 100-Day Project, it’s not about fetishizing finished
products—it’s about the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um, okay. What should I do, though?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Choose your action&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, that’s easy. I will write. (Actually, I will blog.) What is a blog?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A blog (a truncation of the expression weblog)[1] is a discussion or
informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete,
often informal diary-style text entries (“posts”). Posts are typically displayed
in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at
the top of the web page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Write what is a totally legit question and I don’t have an answer to it.
Hopefully, I will find it in the first &lt;em&gt;few&lt;/em&gt; days)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Select a unique hashtag for your project so all your instances of 100 can be
viewed in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hashtag: 100DaysOfWriting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I search for that on Instagram, I find a lot of photos that show computer
screens and that old parchment thing with text photoshopped onto it. This is not
going to be easy, but I can try atleast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– – – – Now, today’s post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to write a lot. Not literature, because I tried that and I
couldn’t do it. I decided that I could settle on reading books and writing some
other stuff. eg: about the books I read, about things that I did on my computer
that day, about some new experience or product that I built or used. That seemed
like a good bargain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I could never stick to it. This blog has had a dismal year last year. There
was only one post. ONLY ONE. That’s absolutely horrible. Today, when I finally
came here after a long time, I realised that this is unacceptable. I need to
write more. After all, last year I read atleast 5 Medium articles that can be
paraphrased as &lt;strong&gt;Reading is great, but eventually, we all must write&lt;/strong&gt;. I don’t
know if those authors had this kind of a pointless rambling in their mind or
not, but I guess this is as good a place to start as any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I am making this commitment. A half hour each day for writing stuff about
the day. Mainly because the experiences that you have change character over
time. What enraged you when it happened, will eventually become an admission of
your own mistakes that lead to it happening (I have a specific incident in mind,
that I haven’t really shared anywhere. So, just assume that something bad
happened to you and then read that sentence again.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, something good happened in your life, but soon your brain will fuzz out the
details and it will become one big pink (pumpkin?) event that happened in your
life, instead of being a sum of the struggle that lead you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, right. &lt;strong&gt;My brain tends to make everything story telling worthy if I don’t
have an account of it that will nudge it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just searched online (DuckDuckGo) to find out how I can find the number of
words that I have written inside Vim. Oh, okay found it. It’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:!wc&lt;/code&gt; after
highlighting the text. I have written 330 words till now. I am at my wit’s end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, or maybe not. I could talk about this movie that I saw today. It’s called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWvoCicq9eo&quot;&gt;The Unreserved&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s made by
a few people belonging to a media production house in Bombay. It’s a chronicle
of stories of the people travelling in the General compartment in Indian trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all Indian trains have many classes. There’s the General compartment, also
know as the Unreserved compartment that’s the cheapest and there isn’t a cap on
the number of people who can enter this compartment (except for shear lack of
space). Then there are the reserved compartments in which you need to book
tickets (upto 120 days in Advance at this point in time, but might change in the
future): Sleeper, 3rd AC, 2nd AC and 1st AC. There are also some trains that
have 2nd Sitting and AC Chair car coaches. The following should give a good idea
of the relative fares:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiarailinfo.com/train/farechart/ticket-fares-gitanjali-express-12860/518/1/1620&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/day-1-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie has a few very touching stories about the people travelling in the
Unreserved compartments across India. (Have I said that already? I feel like I
have said that once already. :/ )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list is, um, startling. But there is one line in the movie that was
especially touching. On a train to Kashmir, there is this guy (from the credits
at the end of the movie, I am pretty sure his name is Mohammad Ashraf), and he
says that his village doesn’t have electricity, and hasn’t had electricity for
almost 3 months, because the transformer was faulty and needed to be replaced
and hasn’t been replaced even now. But then, when he’s asked if he would ever
support India, like his older brother, he says this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jab main koi naukri karunga, tab karunga main Hindustan ko support, koi job
jab milega. … humko jab bijli bhi nahi, kuch nahi, Hindustan kya hain, kuch
nahi hain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;When I get a job in India, then I will support. … We don’t have electricity,
we don’t have anything, so what then is India to us?&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(40:21 - 43:36 in the movie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that came to my mind when I heard him say this was, this is all
that people need. I mean, clean running water, proper electricity, a stable job,
that’s all everyone wants. It’s almost like the citizens are kids, and the
government is a parent, and the government needs to do &lt;em&gt;so less&lt;/em&gt; to please
everyone. It’s just the basics that people want. Nothing huge, nothing
extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POST #1 is OVER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Using colons in the post titles seems to mess with the Yaml formatting, so
switched that to a hyphen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: The image is actually at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/blog/public/img/day-1-1.png&lt;/code&gt;, I totally got
that wrong!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Cutouts, really Just Another Link Aggregator</title>
   <link href="/2016/08/08/cutouts-link-aggregator"/>
   <updated>2016-08-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/08/08/cutouts-link-aggregator</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/cutouts-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpocket.com&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;. And I love it, I love the offline sync
functionality that they have. It is incredibly useful whenever you are
travelling or going somewhere without Internet access (God Forbid!). But there
is one thing that I have never been able to get over, about Pocket, and it’s
that although, it’s a great store for articles until you read them, once you
have read them, it’s not a good store at all. For one, all stored articles take
up space on your mobile, tablets etc. Next, the tagging system doesn’t really
work that way. Going into the Read / Archived section will show you a list of
Links, and there’s no way (except for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Favourite&lt;/code&gt;) option to really mark an
article as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I REALLY LOVED IT!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, storing articles that you have read seems more of a thing that Pinterest
would do, right? You pin the articles that you loved on the board that you
really think it should be on, and I like that idea. But I hate the Pinterest UI,
in the browser. The app is marginally better, but it just feels blocky and
doesn’t flow at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, coming to what I built. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cutouts.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;Cutouts&lt;/a&gt; is a
link aggregator without any of the bells and whistles of Mobile Applications and
Browser integrations. It is one single web page. You sign up, you start adding
articles right away. For every article, you have three fields (I thought about
the number of fields and this made sense right away).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Link to the Article&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Name(s) of the Author(s)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A quote from the article itself - Something that will remind you about what
      this article was really about and generally, I tend to use the catchphrase
      from the article. You can use anything! (You might also enter your own
      comments in here, but that won’t work with the UI that I have planned, but
      it’s fine of course!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using Cutouts for almost 3 months now, and I have added quite a few
articles. I really love the simple UI that I chose to have, which is just a form
on the left and the top 10 articles, reverse-chronologically sorted, on the
right side. Nothing else, and this alongwith Turbolinks on Rails means that the
page loads extremely fast for something that is hosted on the Free plan on
Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Updating Node to node 4.x</title>
   <link href="/2015/10/03/moving-to-node-4"/>
   <updated>2015-10-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/10/03/moving-to-node-4</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Node 4.x was released. Hmm, now that is a huge jump! I have been using Node 0.10.32
and Node 0.12.7 for most of my time in Node till now. I have known that a fork
called io.js has been around for some time now, and has version numbers that have reached 3.x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I realised that Node had updated it’s version to 4.x, the first thing that I
thought of was that I had to update, and then I realized another thing: Backward
compatibility. I have written about 20 Node modules, published on &lt;a href=&quot;http://npmjs.com/~icyflame&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt;
and they probably depend on close to 60-80 modules themselves. So, for everything to work
perfectly, all of these 100 modules need to be written in such a way that they don’t depend
on any feature that was dropped when moving from Node 0.12.x to 4.x. Hmm, it seems
almost impossible that that would be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, voila, it wasn’t. In fact, one of the modules that I had recently built, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/check-pnr-status&quot;&gt;check-pnr-status&lt;/a&gt;
which is to check statuses of various PNRs from the terminal, didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately installed NVM (the version manager n didn’t really seem to work for me)
and ran the module with Node 0.12.7. And it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I was confused. There were quite some dependencies for this particular module,
most notably, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jsdom&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;. Running the module with Node 4 resulted in a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Segmentation Fault&lt;/code&gt;
, yeah, well, that has always been very informative!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not yet gotten any time to fix this yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have any idea how to fix it either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing dependencies to stuff that works on Node 4? Figure out what doesn’t work,
drop an issue there and hope the maintainer is worried about Node 4 and fixes his/her module?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Switching from Chromium to Firefox!</title>
   <link href="/2015/10/03/chromium-vs-firefox"/>
   <updated>2015-10-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/10/03/chromium-vs-firefox</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, one of the few things that almost everyone does after their mid-term exams are over is &lt;em&gt;chill out&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to do this using my browser as well! I was browsing GitHub repositories to contribute to, solving and creating issues on projects I maintain and running music in a tab using YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I had been slightly irritated with the RAM usage of Chromium. It uses about 70% of Memory and 50% of CPU. I still stuck to it because of the great plugin community around Chrome, the really tight integration with most of Google’s services. I liked the Checker Plus for Gmail plugin for Chrome, and this was very important for me. But, enough was enough!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The first time that I opened Chromium to get the vtop screenshot, It slowed the system so much that even &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;htop&lt;/code&gt; was taking so long. And note that on the same computer, I have close to 20 tabs open on Firefox, and I can’t even feel it running! Really really light weight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mem Usage on Chromium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/chromium-top-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;chromium-top-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mem Usage on Firefox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/firefox-top-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;firefox-top-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test conditions&lt;/strong&gt; In both the above tests, all other apps on the system were closed, and pages for a logged in account of GitHub, Gmail, Facebook and Twitter were kept open. It was on Ubuntu 14.04 running 4 GB of RAM and an Intel i5 processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, except for the &lt;strong&gt;Huge&lt;/strong&gt; difference in CPU and MEM usage, the Load Average is also really worth nothing. It is close to 3.5 in Chromium’s case, whereas it is slightly less than 3 in the case of Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after seeing the above, I immediately switched. And started searching for Firefox Add-ons for most of the things I used. I got similar ones, if not the same, for most of them. (I got an extension similar to Checker Plus in &lt;a href=&quot;http://add0n.com/gmail-notifier.html&quot;&gt;Gmail Notifier&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The switch is mostly complete for now. And one of the advantages probably is that Firefox has a built in RSS feed reader, that I don’t need to setup and gives me updates on the Bookmarks Bar itself! I am not sure if Chromium has this feature though, and it’s way too slow for me to close everything else and then find that! So, if any of you use it, please do enlighten me!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>check-pnr-status, The easiest way to track your PNR numbers</title>
   <link href="/2015/09/19/pnr-node-cli-module"/>
   <updated>2015-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/09/19/pnr-node-cli-module</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mid-term exams are almost over. One more paper to go, and there’s enough time to study
for that. So, I worked on the project that I have been working on for about a week now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ultimate goal for building this CLI module was to basically ensure that I didn’t
have to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://irctc.co.in&quot;&gt;IRCTC website&lt;/a&gt; whenever I wanted to
check the status of all the tickets that I have booked. (After the ARP for booking
  tickets was extended to four months, I can book tickets for February 2016 today!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a lot of tickets, and a really really slow website. But there’s one thing that’s
not slow, or atleast not as slow as the website itself. The API that the website
consumes. So, I went out onto the open internet and started searching for a wrapper
written in any language, but one that consumed the IRCTC API (the PNR status part, at
  the very least), so that I could model my code as per the requests in that wrapper,
and hence have access to the API. Searching was hard and took a significant bit of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, as this was not a programming issue, but one that is India-centric,
I didn’t find anything on Stack Overflow. What really helped me though was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-official-API-for-IRCTC-Indian-Railways-PNR-Status&quot;&gt;this
Quora question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through each answer in turn, I finally ended up at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/salilpa/pnrapi-python/&quot;&gt;this GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/salilpa/&quot;&gt;@salilpa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out the requests I had to make to get the required data. I didn’t go into the
detailed code of the repository, but I got the request I wanted, and yay! I was ready to parse
the information out of the complex and completely &lt;strong&gt;unstructured&lt;/strong&gt; HTML that IRCTC pages
are always composed of! (There were 5 nested tables with a huge amount of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; elements
  inside each other that made looking at the markup not even an option.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, Chrome Dev Tools helped out, and saved the day! I highlighted the element I wanted
and used the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Copy CSS Path&lt;/code&gt; functionality, which worked perfectly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/pnr-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I had to parse the information I wanted out of the HTML, and I all I had were
CSS selectors. I needed something like jQuery, that would build the DOM and then, allow
me to select the text / HTML of the required element. Suffice it to say that it was not as easy
as it sounds, and certainly not as easy as in the browser (where the DOM is always available).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio&quot;&gt;cheerio&lt;/a&gt;, as almost everyone loathed
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom&quot;&gt;jsdom&lt;/a&gt; and had shifted from jsdom to cheerio. I started working with it,
and there was some weird problem. It was working with one of the selectors which had an
ID followed by three other &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tr:nth-child&lt;/code&gt; blocks. But it wasn’t working with any of the other
three selectors. Around 45 minutes of debugging led me to a one-liner StackOverflow
comment that said something close to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;JSDom has the memory leak issue since long. You should switch to Cheerio, the only
issue being that it doesn’t support all the selectors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, yeah. It would have been better if they had just mentioned that on the Cheerio
README. There was one block about supporting all sizzle selectors, but I wasn’t really
sure how to check if the selectors I was using were sizzle selectors or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, now that I had found out (the hard way) that Cheerio was not going to
cut it, I moved to jsdom, and it worked well for one PNR. I was basically using jQuery
and not a wrapper, so there was absolutely no issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again, integration tests failed. JSDom has had a memory leak issue for some time now,
and then, they fixed the issue but dropped support for Node.js 0.12, and moved to
io.js. This was absolutely frustrating for me and I had to slightly re-structure my module
to take this into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I decided to stay with Node.js and rather, concat all the resultant HTML pieces
together and use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; function in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jQuery&lt;/code&gt; to get all the elements matching a particular selector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, again, I had to remove the one selector which had an ID with a generic selector. (ID
  selectors are assumed to have only one target.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after about 4 hours of hacking around the code to fix everything, I spent another half-hour
doing some housekeeping stuff, proper git commits, fixing debugging lines, writing the readme,
updating the package.json file, removing unnecessary deps, etc. Once I was done with all this,
I &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm version&lt;/code&gt;-ed it and published it to NPM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first experience working with a completely dishelved API, that had absolutely
no structure to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in conclusion, &lt;em&gt;JSON APIs&lt;/em&gt; are awesome, but even if it’s not JSON, you can get around that with
a some amount of effort!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Internship at TinyOwl Mumbai!</title>
   <link href="/2015/09/15/summers-2016-tinyowl"/>
   <updated>2015-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/09/15/summers-2016-tinyowl</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn’t really end up doing this internship because on January 12, 2016, TinyOwl revoked
the internship offers that it had made to 7 people in IIT Kharagpur due to internal turmoil. I don’t have
the heart to remove this post because this is exactly how I felt at the end of the interview, and I want
this to be out there for other people searching about TinyOwl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyowl.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/tinyowl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tinyowl-logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this post is long overdue. On 30th August, 2015, TinyOwl visited IIT Kharagpur to recruit interns for their internship program, during the months of May-July, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I noticed when I saw their intenship notification form on the ERP, was that they used Ruby on Rails! That got me excited. To top it off, there were some more things that I was totally excited about. They used Grunt, Bower, Yeoman, and that’s it. I was sold! I had to apply for this company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the first non-core web-dev-related company that had opened for Mechanical Engineering. And I was excited about it right from the moment I submitted the CV. Before submitting, I sent the CV to &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/prudhvid&quot;&gt;@prudhvid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/ankeshanand&quot;&gt;@ankeshanand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/light94&quot;&gt;@light94&lt;/a&gt; to get it proofread and corrected, and they gave some really awesome suggestions. Spending some more time tweaking the LaTeX file and finally, I was ready to submit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I submitted the CV and waited. I had no idea that they were going to conduct an online coding round. In fact, I found out about the test at 1730, around 1733, when I recieved an email from HackerRank, which was the platform they were using to conduct this test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rushed to the CIC, as that was where we were supposed to give this test. I reached around 15 minutes late, but as it was a time-bound test, and HackerRank itself took care of the total time given to each candidate, there wasn’t much of an issue there. I sat down and started the test, and there was only one question. Hmm, taken aback slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question was to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Find the number of k-subsequences from an n-array whose sum was divisble by the integer k&lt;/code&gt;. Integers &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; were given in the problem. The data acquistion from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt; was already done in the solution, we just had to fill out the function that found the number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was fill out the function with a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;O(2^n)&lt;/code&gt; solution, that was linear in memory (I think). I didn’t expect it to clear more than 2 testcases, but surprisingly it cleared 4 of them before the other testcases started timing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to search for a more time-intensive solution. I tried a lot of approaches for an hour, and had to finally submit a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;O(n^3)&lt;/code&gt; solution that was &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n^2&lt;/code&gt; in memory. It cleared only 2 test cases, but it was far better on time. (Other test cases were running out of memory.) So, I submitted the code. I later found out that I should have submitted the earlier code that passed 4 test cases, as that’s the metric used by most companies while evaluating such tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all of this, I waited. Come saturday night, and the shortlist was released. 23 people were selected for hte Personal Interview. Come sunday, and about 12-14 hours from 8 in the morning to 8 at night, (most of the time involving waiting for my turn), I had given one interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list was finally officially released around 2230 that night, and hell yeah, I was happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the part that excites me even more about this internship, is that I am going to go back to Mumbai after two long long years! Yay! :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, per tradition, I posted about this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/kannan.siddharth/posts/928403613901748&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, the next night!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mentorship in Production!</title>
   <link href="/2015/08/21/mentorship-in-production"/>
   <updated>2015-08-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/08/21/mentorship-in-production</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finally, a Rails application in production. And already, we have started facing problems! Whoever said deploying and maintaining web apps is more than half of the job, was definitely right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mentorship.iikgp.ernet.in/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/mentorship.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mentorship&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I hope to outline exactly what lead to the deployment, and how we handled it, and what lead to the present wall that we are facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if I wrote about this before, but still, a short introduction about the Mentorship Portal. It’s a Rails application, that we had written last semester, between January and March, and had hoped would take the whole Mentorship Programme run by Students’ Alumni Cell online. It did exactly that, and everyone registered. The allotment was getting held up, because somewhere down the line, we screwed up the server config, as it had crashed, and we couldn’t get it back up. When I came back for this semester, I was determined to solve this, and solved it in the first few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we faced the mailer problem. We couldn’t send emails through that server because it was not configured to be an email relay. We found out that there were other email relays, that we could get access to, provided we could get over some red-tape first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since all we had to do was just to send a mass mail to everyone saying that the allotment has taken place, we immediately did that, using another mass mailer that we already have a license for. Soon after this, the page started getting a lot of hits. (close to 100 a day, during the first few days after the mass email was sent out. For posterity, it’s been only two days since!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One big big feature that was missing from the portal was the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Forgot Password&lt;/code&gt; feature that almost all of us have come to take for granted. One basic thing that is required to solve a problem like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Forgot Password&lt;/code&gt; is that the server must be able to communicate, either by sending emails or SMSes. The one other alternative was asking Security Questions, but those will never guarantee complete security, and we didn’t have enough data on the users to safely use that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we started getting emails on a monitored inbox, and I was manually mailing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reset_password_hash&lt;/code&gt; to all the people who had forgotten their password, they later visited a page where they entered this hash and the email ID and created a new password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem with this approach was that the manual mailing part was very very time-consuming, and ideally, this was something that should be done by the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I continued to try to use Mailgun Servers to send email. But weirdly enough, the Python script that I was calling from inside Ruby was just not working. A debuggin session that lasted more than 45 minutes led to naught, and I was frustrated and left the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I have spoken with the institute people, and it turns out that the red-tape for using the mail relay that these guys have setup is not a lot and we can get over it, with some perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that’s where things stand at now. We will get the permission to use those relays within the next couple week probably. But till then, I will have to generate the hash and mail all the users their hash. Not the most ideal setup.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Atom 1.0, The Hackable editor</title>
   <link href="/2015/06/25/the-hackable-editor"/>
   <updated>2015-06-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/06/25/the-hackable-editor</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NodeJS is awesome! (That’s kind of the sentence that I see daily on the web, nowadays!). But, this post is not related to that. (Or maybe it is, since Atom is written in Javascript, and NodeJS is Javascript, on steroids!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I see this announcement on GitHub, saying &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Atom 1.0 is out&lt;/code&gt;, I open the announcement, and see an awesome video! (&amp;lt;3 GitHub!) The video is actually awesome! It’s old school, the people are all old fashioned, but the video itself depicts the future in an irony type setting. And it’s cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, My computer’s D Drive is getting filled about 99% (it is currently at 99.5%), &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; is filled 60%, and somehow, everything is a bit slow, and I am trying new browsers, (Enter Firefox and Midori) and new ZSH terminal prompts (Enter RobbyRussell, Agnoster), and it felt right to change the editor too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But anyway, getting to the product. Atom 1.0. I had tried out an earlier version of Atom, and it was somewhere around 0.7, or something, I don’t even know for sure. But I do remember it was slow, crashing all the time, and the auto-fill was not great, Sublime’s native thing was better, and it just wasn’t worth it, and I uninstalled it, and life went on. I was eager to checkout 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing 1.0 was painless, they packaged a DEB, (and that’s awesome, everything should either come through &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;, have a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tarball&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deb&lt;/code&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened a HTML project in Atom! And it looked great, that was the first thing I noticed! It looked awesome: the typeface, the colors. The color scheme that is currently being used is probably Solarise, It feels like Solarise, I am not sure though. But anyways, it looks great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing that I used was auto-fill, it was like Sublime. I am not going to say anything more about this really, because I have not really used it with JavaScript, Rails or other back-end frameworks. I just used it a bit with a plain HTML file, and only selectors were getting auto-filled, and I am happy with it, but we have that in Sublime. So, nothing new yet! I will probably do another post just about auto-fill! (After using Vim’s auto-fill plugins, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimawesome.com/plugin/youcompleteme&quot;&gt;YouCompleteMe&lt;/a&gt;, the editor must be &lt;strong&gt;atleast&lt;/strong&gt; as good as that!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Atom is built by GitHub, and thus, I expected two things. First of all, of course, complete integration with GitHub. I was pretty sure about this, and I think it’s baked in. I have not tested a lot of it, but it seems to be baked in. But the second thing, and probably the thing that I am more interested in, is how much Git is baked in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over my last few days with Sublime, I had installed a Git plug-in, and I was doing a lot from the editor itself, not too much, I mean the command line is the big brother of everything? But basically, the plug-in could do everything except &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;amend&lt;/code&gt; and pushing to remotes other than &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt;. So, after this plugin, I like doing small commits a lot, and it makes sense too, and this worked well with the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right bottom corner in Atom has the git branch, the diff stat for the current file. And the left sidebar highlights the files yellow and green as per it’s new or not, and edited or not. And all this is cool, but apart from this, commits or anything else was not built in out of the box. Probably, a no-brainer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure why they did not built that in. Of course, I can go ahead and install a plugin and all will be well again in the world. But it just feels that as a company that is building an editor for developers, and if that editor could cater to people who are new to Git by having everything built in, then that would be awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They would probably bake that in the next release? I don’t even know if they have it in their feature list. I am going to head over to their repository, and look for a related issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it feels like this is going to be a good editor experience. I am not sure, but I guess that’s the cool thing about new software!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Using Git Flow, and why it cleans up history, A LOT!</title>
   <link href="/2015/06/16/using-git-flow"/>
   <updated>2015-06-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/06/16/using-git-flow</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am a lover of projects with clean history. They always end up being some of the best maintained and working projects. I guess I must refer to the big Dad of all Open Source repositories, Linux when I refer to this. Looking at the history in it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/torvalds/linux&quot;&gt;GitHub Repo&lt;/a&gt;, it’s full of merge commits that make sense. You can see the changes going up the ladder, and Linus Torvalds accepting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git Flow does essentially that. Git has a lot of options that you can take, as a maintainer, you are just confused and you let the history decay. Git Flow ensures you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic &lt;em&gt;funda&lt;/em&gt; behind Git Flow is that there are two branches, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; that are always part of a project. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; is the branch where all the development takes place, and gets tested in a staging environment. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; is the branch where the latest production ready version of an application resides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you branch out from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt;, and add a feature. Once this feature is over, you can either add more features, all of which will stay on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt;, or you can start a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;release&lt;/code&gt;. This branch will allow you to make some last minutes changes (bump version number in JSON files, change API keys to Environment variables, basically, remove everything that was added because you were prototyping a feature, and not building it for production.) After this, you finish the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;release&lt;/code&gt;, which is a major step in Git Flow, because it does a whole lot of things. It merges the release branch into master, and creates a new commit, whose message you are allowed to edit. (You can close all GitHub issues through this message). After this, it then creates a tag at the latest commit on master, you are in control of the tag message. (the name of the tag is the name of the release. There are options to not create a tag, just in case you gave a meaningful name, instead of semantic version.) And finally, the last step of the process is back-merging this tag into &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt;, to ensure that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; stay on the same page, immediately after a release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some other commands like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;publishing&lt;/code&gt; a release, which will basically push it to a server. But since, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; already does that, there’s no reason why it should be used, if you are comfortable with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that I like the most about Git Flow is that it can be used independently by the maintainer of a project, regardless of whether the contributors are using it or not. You can simply pull their changes into a new feature branch, so that you are always in control of the names of the features, and the names of the releases. Often, with toolkits such as these, the whole team needs to migrate from existing tools to this particular tool, and that is not ideal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is the cheat sheet that gave me the confidence to get into Git Flow, almost instantaneously!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why developers shouldn't have to deal with configuration</title>
   <link href="/2015/06/10/convention-over-configuration"/>
   <updated>2015-06-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/06/10/convention-over-configuration</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ruby on Rails is built on the principle of convention over configuration. Right upto now, I have deployed production applications on an in house server which invariably ran into some wall or the other. (Check out my rant about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://icyflame.github.io/blog/web-development/2015/05/01/deploying-on-an-inhouse-server/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) Meanwhile, we did test runs of all the applications on Heroku, and that ran without any issues, almost all the time. (Except a couple of times, before I discovered &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rails_12factor&lt;/code&gt; ) But this flawless ness was never put to the test, in a live environment, with lots of non-developers, users using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, today, I got the chance to deploy &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/icyflame/erp-rails&quot;&gt;erp-rails&lt;/a&gt; to Heroku. (Huge sigh of relief!) It is now deployed and ready to be used. Active use will start only in August first week, when the new second year team is recruited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, there has been one feature which I have added over the past couple days. And the feature addition included a change in all three fronts of the website. A migration changing the schema, new endpoint in the controller, and JavaScript validation code in the form. It was pure development, no change in configuration at all. No going through the logs repeatedly, no chceking JS &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;console&lt;/code&gt; on the browser, nothing of the sort at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also the first time round when I have been actively using GitHub issues to maintain this project. It is a major productivity enhancement tool, allowing us to maintain more than one component in the same application without issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travis CI is the other tool that I have used and am extremely happy with! The auto deploy feature of Travis CI is just &lt;em&gt;painless&lt;/em&gt;. Once setup, (about 150 commits ago), I haven’t had to change anything at all. A change in the application name, and that’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apps get deployed appropriately, builds get logged. And once in a while, when you get the &lt;strong&gt;Errored&lt;/strong&gt; email, you just have to go in and see the log!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess configuration is inevitable, and everyone needs to go through it, &lt;strong&gt;once&lt;/strong&gt;. That should probably be the case all around, you configure once and don’t have to re-configure unless there is a major change in the application architecture. Certainly, no configuration should be required for running regular migrations, updating features, etc. (we have had to deal with some major pain due to migrations, and we have considered more than once the possibility of moving to something like MongoDB.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for now, the stack consists Ruby on Rails, GitHub, Heroku, TravisCI, Slack, all of it powered by a Linux machine and Git!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>CLI Apps and NodeJS, Made for each other?</title>
   <link href="/2015/06/03/cli-apps-and-node-js"/>
   <updated>2015-06-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/06/03/cli-apps-and-node-js</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After starting to follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sindresorhus&quot;&gt;@sindresorhus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/kevva&quot;&gt;@kevva&lt;/a&gt;, the one thing that started filling my GitHub timeline, were repositories like [is-online], [wifi-password], [is-video], etc. These were NodeJS repositories that did something really simple, like checking if the computer was online, confirming if the file that the path points to is a video or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one other thing that was interesting was that these ran from a NodeJS script as well as the CLI. It seemded like one of the easiest method to package a CLI application. And thus, started a journey across @sindresorhus and @kevva’s code. Finding the place where this code exactly was took more time than I thought. Checking through the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file, I found the slightly suspicious &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt; declartion, in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pkg&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slight googling about this led me to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; manifest, it explained a lot of other options there, which I was not using, such as the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author&lt;/code&gt; and it’s subfields. I filled in all these fields in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, and published to NPM again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, I didn’t feel the need to talk about that, because it was simple, like really really simple. It was almost as easy as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit the package.json file, and push the package to NPM. The package is now hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-cube-timer&quot;&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt;. The package itself is a Rubik’s Cube timer, on the Command Line thing. Time all your solves right from the command line. It has a surprising amount of downloads, If I say so myself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one other thing that I have always wanted from a Rubik’s Cube timer, is that it store my times forever, without any unreliability. And I believe that this module, when completed, will be able to do just that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The module is open source, and is licensed under MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a non-geek, super-normal Indian Railways traveller post!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a post that I am writing as I move rapidly towards Chennai, my final destination! The summer at KGP is over, and now, I go back home! (The train itself is around 5 hours late, so, in place of reaching Chennai at around 2300, I will be reaching around 0500 or 0600 the next morning.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trains are great places, if you get the right berth and the right set of people to travel with. In India, the set of people that you are travelling with takes on a more than could be expected level of importance, when you are travelling alone. This is because a lone traveller (wolf) on an Indian train is the must vulnerable (endangered) of species!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People travelling alone are plagued with requests to exchange their seats/berths. Sometimes, refusing does get a little hard, and most of the times, you end up exchanging!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very common thing encountered by all single travellers is the lack of company (You must be like: Duh!). Books serve best, Books on Paper have somehow evolved into TV Series on Laptops, for most college students!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And coming to the topic of students, and people of all kind, &lt;strong&gt;no internet&lt;/strong&gt;. (Picture an exasperated always-online person saying that!) It’s not the lack of social networking, and Gmail that disturbs me, rather, it’s the inability to do anything that alarms me. And by anything, I mean, just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a Node App, and want to install a plugin that writes JSON files painlessly? Sure, do it &lt;strong&gt;when&lt;/strong&gt; you get home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, coming back to the train itself, I started travelling in 3rd and 2nd AC compartments, around 2013, and since it’s air-conditioned, there’s no real problem. The windows remain useful all through the day, but the scenery, is, well &lt;strong&gt;repetitive&lt;/strong&gt;, I guess is the right word. It’s almost like train tracks across India have been built in between fields and farms. Almost always, these fields have electric poles, and huge hubs right in the middle. This is the way it is no matter on which train you are, travelling wherever you want to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as explained above, I will not be publihing this until I get home on 28th. But it just seemed right to give the date of the post as the date when I was in the train!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tmux, Better than terminator?</title>
   <link href="/2015/05/24/tmux-terminator-ver-2"/>
   <updated>2015-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/05/24/tmux-terminator-ver-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the about page of this blog, I talked about the application &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Terminator&lt;/a&gt; and how it is part of my virtual workspace, apart from Vim, Sublime, Git and Linux!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, I came across Tmux, and it seemed interesting. It was a pain to get started with, to be honest. The default prefix key is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ctrl+B&lt;/code&gt;, and having to press that before even switching panes in a window, that was a pane. (Did I mean &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pain&lt;/code&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I went through the documentation and didn’t really understand much at the beginning. It was all panes, windows, sessions, servers, clients, and so on. I had to start using this, and just hope that somewhere down the line I would understand what all the words really meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I am confident that I understand, and I love it! Changing over to the new prefix and arrow keys scheme was hard, and un-intuitive right at the beginning. But now, not so much. I have one session up and running, and inside that session I have about four windows. Of these four windows, two of them run the two development servers that I almost always need, npm and rails. (I like multi-tasking across projects!) Apart from these servers, I have a pane dedicated to git pulls, and pushes. I have a soft corner for the up arrow key, you see. I have some more panes in these development windows. The rails window, needs two panes for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;zeus start&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;zeus server&lt;/code&gt;. (I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/burke/zeus&quot;&gt;zeus&lt;/a&gt; for all of my Rails development! It’s faster, and doesn’t need frequent restarting, unless of course one of the initializer file changes!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while tmux was great and all that, one of the features of Terminator that I particularly loved was that I could configure a default setup at each startup. This setup was extremely painless. Well, guess what? Tmux did it better. Or atleast there was a plugin that did it better! And thus, much with a deja vu feeling as I had when I first started using Vim, I found a plugin that changed the way the tmux status line looked, and another plugin that was very aptly named &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tmux-resurrect&lt;/code&gt;, yes, indeed! It resurrected the session which was running earlier, exactly as it was. I was slightly awed by this, it was not &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; hard to implement, I guess, if you knew how to do it. But it was just, apt for the moment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, thus, with all this setup, I am on my way to using tmux, probably forever!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Falling in love with GruntJS</title>
   <link href="/2015/05/11/falling-in-love-with-grunt"/>
   <updated>2015-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/05/11/falling-in-love-with-grunt</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, after that marathon of two posts on the same day (which had a slight issue in formatting the first time I published it), this is my post about GruntJS, again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted about GruntJS once &lt;a href=&quot;http://icyflame.github.io/blog/web-development/2015/03/30/grunt-js-is-awesome/&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;. That was the basic configuration that I had got going on the first time around. It didn’t do much. Just the basic plugins: prettifying the HTML, minifying the CSS and JavaScript and the Watch plugin, for automatic plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after that, I realised that my builds were just taking too long, which was when a little bit of research led me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/tooling/supercharging-your-gruntfile/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. That article was awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading the article, I was convinced that I just had to use the plugins mentioned here. I ended up using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;load grunt tasks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;grunt concurrent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;time-grunt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;grunt newer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, these plugins were just the tip of the iceberg, but they reduced the buildtimes that I currently had (about 30 seconds per build) to a mere 10 seconds for slight changes in the HTML files. 10 seconds still feels a lot longer when sitting in front of a i5 4th Generation machine, but nonetheless, it works well with my workflow. In the time that it takes for either Grunt to run the tasks or for Git to push everything to the cloud, I can easily check my work emails, and Slack for any new messages, and revert back to them, if they need my attention. (It also works well, when I don’t really like the song that’s playing and want to change it!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s go through these plugins one-by-one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;load grunt tasks&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This plugin loads all the plugins directly from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file, this ensures that I don’t have to write the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loadNpmTasks&lt;/code&gt; line in the GruntFile. (with more than 10 lines, that part of the file is really just a waste of SLOC). I integrated this plugin pretty fast, and it worked pretty well too, but as I already had the Gruntfile with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loadNpmTasks&lt;/code&gt; file, there was no significant change in the build time. Starting a new project, of course, this plugin will affect stuff a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;grunt concurrent&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the one plugin that improved built times a helluva lot. Using this plugin, you can basically run the tasks that are independent of each other concurrently. The prettifying, and the minification step of all the HTML, CSS, JS files are independent of each other and thus, these three can be done concurrently. The minification step is dependent on the concatenation of the files, and this meant that I had to run the concat step in the first cycle, and the minification in the second cycle. This cut my build time by a good 3-4 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;time-grunt&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is a frontend plugin that is helping me make all the above comments about the time that the complete build and each part of the build takes. This was the first plugin that I included in the project, so I could see the improvement in the build-times. It puts out a good picture that the time that every part of a task took. The output looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/wTA6efq.png&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;grunt newer&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Once the above plugins are included in the project, the build time does improve, but even then, the above plugins run the same task again and again. For even a slight change (like a change in the background color), the whole build runs again. And this is a colossal waste of time. And this plugin takes care of that. It runs only the tasks that correspond to files that have been changed. With this, for slight changes like, adding an image tag, in one HTML file, I can get build times that are as low as 7 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the above list of plugins is probably the list of plugins that I will be using in every frontend project that I take on from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from this, there’s this other integration that can be done in Sublime Text: Creating a build system!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a build system for Grunt, and that was super easy. (Create build system -&amp;gt; enter the command as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;grunt&lt;/code&gt; and you are done!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now, I don’t have to leave my editor to run the build. This works great when making small changes, you can build the project from there and switch to the browser (which I love keeping in another workspace), and check the output, and if that works well, commit and push the changes!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Travis CI, Revisited for Rails</title>
   <link href="/2015/05/01/travis-ci-revisited-for-rails"/>
   <updated>2015-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/05/01/travis-ci-revisited-for-rails</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post is long overdue. Now, that the semester is over, I have found time to do two of the things that I intend to completely master over the summer: NodeJS and Formula 1 2014. While the first is a programming framework which has a staggering amount of possibilities, the latter is a game for the PC, that has completly taken me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started playing F1 2014 sometime around March, this year, and I found it to be really boring in the beginning. But then, I got into seeing gameplay videos of the game. And in particular, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/tiametmarduk1&quot;&gt;this YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, where videos are uploaded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/tiametmarduk&quot;&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt;. The gameplay videos are great! Fun to watch, but the part I love the most is the live commentary given by the player. It’s just awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, now, coming back to the title of this post. Travis CI!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time ago (about 6 months ago), I posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://icyflame.github.io/blog/web-development/2014/09/28/cracking-travis-ci/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; about TravisCI. It was a naive post about getting Travis to work for a PHP project, I couldn’t get it to work at the end, but I had not abandoned it completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when I went back to travisCI for a Ruby on Rails project, well, I was dead-set to get it right, and surprisingly, all that determination and dead-set-ness was a bit anti-climactic, as the setup was painless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the setup was so painless, that I went on to integrate Heroku with TravisCI for automated deploys. Further, I also integrated a Slack channel into the whole scheme of things. (I am going to post about my love for Slack soon after this!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now, my stack looks like this. A Ruby on Rails project, on which two people are working. For every push, Travis builds the project and posts the status on our Team channel at Slack. This is done for every branch, every pull request etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, coming to the auto-deploy part. Every push that I make to the staging branch is built, and if it passes the build process, then the code on that branch gets deployed to a staging Heroku application. And every push that I make to the master branch gets deployed to the production Heroku application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, basically, I have a complete automated app up and runing, in which all I, as a maintainer, have to do, is check the front-end and push to staging, check the front end on the staging Heroku application, and if that checks out, I simply merge the staging branch with master, and boom! The production application on Heroku gets updated and everyone gets the changes that I had pushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is awesome! I had never really imagined that I would be able to do so much, so soon and so painlessly. This streamlines the code-to-deploy process a whole lot! No worrying about setting up heroku remotes, the Heroku account you are signed in on the CLI, pushing a wrong branch to the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the worst, pushing changes that break the application to the production app, affecting everyone who is dependent on your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that is TravisCI for Rails. Somehow, I think that the change in the platform that we are using PHP -&amp;gt; Ruby on Rails, made the process so much more simpler and easier to handle. Well, I won’t forget to include this in my list of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Why I love Rails&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, some housekeeping information. The project that I have been talking about is the Networking Portal Project. Find it on Github &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/icyflame/networking-rails&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This project is licensed under MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Deploying on an in-house server (RANT)</title>
   <link href="/2015/05/01/deploying-on-an-inhouse-server"/>
   <updated>2015-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/05/01/deploying-on-an-inhouse-server</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, this is probably my first &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rant&lt;/code&gt; per se, on anything related to Ruby on Rails. And it’s connected with a step that just can’t be avoided by any Rails application: Production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rant begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never thought this would be much of a problem, since I had been using Heroku almost all my time with Rails, and deploys were super quick, and super-easy! Hardly ever did I run into any walls, and even when I did, the documentation on Heroku and Stack Overflow was more than enough to get me up and running soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter, Inhouse Server. So, in IITKGP, we have a set of servers that we administer as part of Students’ Alumni Cell, and they are servers that are housed inside the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cic.iitkgp.ernet.in&quot;&gt;Computer Informatics Center&lt;/a&gt;. We have SSH access to them, and they are connected to the Internet, and almost all the websites that are there in here, the Institute website, the ERP system for students/faculty, etc, are hosted on inhouse servers, and maintained by Ops people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may ask: why the sudden need to deploy? Well, yeah, that’s what we asked too! We had a running application on this server, but then, suddenly, everything stopped working, and we had to re-install Apache on the server. Yeah, that was easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, we configured one of the front end sites that we manage, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alumnimeet.iitkgp.ernet.in&quot;&gt;Annual Alumni Meet Website&lt;/a&gt;, and that was done pretty fast. We didn’t have to change much, just edit the Apache Conf files a bit and boom, we were done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the one other Rails application that we had to host in here was the Mentorship Portal. (part of this has been open sourced, find the code &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/icyflame/mentorship-website-cum-portal&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) We had been running on Passenger instance earlier, so we decided to keep the same Configuration, and we were surprised to find that passenger was already installed. So, in that case, basically, we didn’t have to do anything, just follow the steps mentioned on the documentation of Passenger and voila, we should have had the application up, right? well, just that it didn’t work that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran the steps that were mentioned on the Passenger documentation. Which was basically just one step &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo passenger-install-apache2-module&lt;/code&gt;, copy a few lines into the designated files, and restart apache2. Alas, it didn’t start working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we tried a lot of other things. (Contemplating a change from Passenger to Capistrano being one of them), but we couldn’t get anything to work at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing that did work for us was the Passenger standalone setup. This setup was perfect for us, except for the fact that this setup listens on port 3000 and we needed to listen on port 80, which is what we had configured in Apache2. We could fix this. (By simply redirecting from Apache to Passenger), we would have had a working web server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, another roadblock! Turns out that the alumnimeet website that we believed had been setup was actually working only inside the campus network, the site was still inaccessible from outside the campus network. This is something that we just can’t seem to fix. We will have to contact the people at CIC, and get this fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying with Rails was apparently tough, before Passenger came along, but seriously, deploying with an InHouse server will probably always be tough. Atleast, when you don’t do that for a living :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rant End.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Grunt JS is Awesome!</title>
   <link href="/2015/03/30/grunt-js-is-awesome"/>
   <updated>2015-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/03/30/grunt-js-is-awesome</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, finally, after a long long time, during a particular project, I got the chance to get my hands dirty with the JavaScript Task Runner, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gruntjs.com&quot;&gt;GruntJS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have been using Sublime Text and the auto-indent function that is embedded with it for almost a year, or perhaps, more than that! But one thing that has been sub-par is definitely the quality of code that comes out of this engine. A lot of the tags are not indented properly. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; are in the next level of indentation of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; tags. And inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;body&lt;/code&gt;, if a tag is closed in the same line, then the whole indentation breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was when I remembered reading about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yaniswang/HTMLHint&quot;&gt;HTMLHint&lt;/a&gt;. Although, I didn’t really know what it meant, and was pretty clueless of its utility, I believed that like me, a lot of developers out there would obsess about well-indented HTML code, and if that was the case, then definitely there would be a tool to achieve that! And sure as that, there was!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter, GruntJS. I had read up about this some time last semester, when I was writing front-end code at Alumni Cell, I had tried using but had ditched it, because it took way too long to understand, and I was facing some setup issues as well. Now, armed with a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine, I conquered this again, and voila, I succeeded!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation process was painless for the most part, I installed &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nodejs&lt;/code&gt;, followed by the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;grunt-cli&lt;/code&gt;. After this, I had the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;grunt&lt;/code&gt; command in my terminal. Further, I created the two required files for Grunt, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, a standard file that is present in &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; nodeJS applications, and a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gruntfile.js&lt;/code&gt; that declares the tasks that Grunt needs to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, grunt has a whole set of plugins, that can be installed and once you change the corresponding JSON inside the Gruntfile appropriately, you have the task setup and that plugin will take care of the task itself. These plugins are installed through NPM, and are pretty easy to install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the basic task was simply writing the Grunt tasks, themselves. They are slightly intimidating right when you start out. This is probably because I am not familiar with JSON. For someone familiar with JSON, this would be cakewalk!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical Grunt task to prettify HTML files looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prettify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;indent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;indent_char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;expand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;*.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;build/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this task, I am simply declaring the options to be used for HTML prettifying, 2 space indents, wrap lines at 78 characters and leave the specified tags (such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sup&lt;/code&gt; etc) unformatted. After this, under the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;all&lt;/code&gt; seciton, I give the target files. I am giving all the HTML files that are present in the root of the directory. (Alongside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gruntfile.js&lt;/code&gt;) and the destination is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;build/&lt;/code&gt; folder, where these prettified files are stored with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt; extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output of this task is &lt;strong&gt;amazing!&lt;/strong&gt; The HTML is just so, clean &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love well-indented code, because it looks great, is a pleasure to read, and just tells everyone else how amazingly detail-oriented the author was!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everyone write well-indented code, … Well, that is the dream!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rolling into production!</title>
   <link href="/2015/03/17/rolling-into-production"/>
   <updated>2015-03-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/03/17/rolling-into-production</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ruby on Rails &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have rolled out our first ever production application written in Ruby on Rails. And by “we” I mean the Students’ Alumni Cell. This is the first time that SAC has deployed a RoR app. We have been joint at the hips with PHP and CodeIgniter for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application is the Mentorship Portal, which is a centralized portal for the registration of mentors and students, and at a later point in time, we will also do the allotments through this portal. It’s an application written in RoR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some things about this application that I really want to say now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The templating language is ERB, for no other reason than that it is the one bundled with Rails and it was the first one that me and the team learnt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The application is deployed on a Phusion Passenger, with Apache. I didn’t do the server setup. (In fact, I was in Chennai when this setup happenned! It was done by a certain &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/light94&quot;&gt;Rahul Mishra&lt;/a&gt;) Once I came back, I was delighted to see that the setup was up and running on an inhouse server. Till now, we had been deploying on the free plan of Heroku. (which in itself is pretty awesome!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were a lot of issues that we faced when we were setting it up and subsequently when we were changing the code on the server often. One of the issues that we faced often was that the DB was not updated to the latest version. Now, we have come to a point when the mentor registrations have started and thus we have stopped pushing any updates to the server which require adding columns to the DB. This very often breaks the application and rolling back is not too easy either. One of the things that we felt was an issue was our use of &lt;strong&gt;MySql&lt;/strong&gt;. Till now, we have always used PostGreSQL in Production and SQLite in development. This change didn’t affect the code (Again, RoR &amp;lt;3) but it definitely changed a lot of the config and environment files, and tracking these changes is getting too complicated, and we will have to figure out something to ensure that this change doesn’t backfire.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apart from this, the server itself was running without any problems. One thing that surprised us was that it never went down because of “Too many requests”. We don’t really know how much traffic we were handling, so, we don’t know why this was the case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have also been writing an application in Django. It’s a pretty simple application and could be developed in RoR within a couple of hours. But surprising is the fact that even in Django, which I was using for the first time, it did not take me more than 4 hours, in total to get the working application. I have not yet deployed it or open-sourced it on GitHub because there are a still a lot of refinements that I want to make and a lot of testing I want to do. (I have written the authentication system, so yeah. A helluva lot of testing is left to do!) I will probably write a post about this soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://light94.github.io/2015/02/28/Setting-up-Phusion-Passenger-with-Apache-for-Running-Rails-App/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post by &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/light94&quot;&gt;Rahul Mishra&lt;/a&gt; regarding the Phusion Passenger setup!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Short One.</title>
   <link href="/2015/02/10/the-short-one"/>
   <updated>2015-02-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/02/10/the-short-one</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my first post in 2015. It is pretty weird that I have not posted anything throughout January, despite a lot of things happenning. (Especially Spring Fest, at which Farhan Akhtar performed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance was one of the best that I had ever been to. And it was definitely the best performance for some years to come. Last year’s Agni’s performance and Salim-Sulaiman’s performance does compare to this performance but only to some extent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a short post because as I speak, I am inching closer to a Thermodynamics test. The test starts at 5:30, about 3.5 hours from now, and the thing to be highlighted about the test is that it is goign to take place in the Computer and Informatics Centre. We use a software called the Engineering Equation Solver (a pretty drab name) by a company called FChart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been using this for the past few days and there are good days and then there are bad days. The editor that the software ships in (most of the time we spend using the software is in the editor) does not have any basic functionality. It seems a like an extended version of the Notepad editor, that ships with all Windows Installations. The functionality is surprisingly poor. (Only one undo operation). A full stack programmer’s editor (Sublime or Vim or Emacs) does not even compare with that. It obviously doesn’t have multiple cursors, although we definitely need it. (Copying stuff over three times is definitely a waste of time!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from this, I am using CyanogenMod 12 Beta 5 as my daily driver on Xperia L. I flashed it sometime around the last week of Spring Fest. CM 11 was the first Operating System that I flashed. I felt great about the customisability that it gave me. Xperia L does not have a stable version on their website and so I had to flash a nightly build. The builds work well, but they often create trouble. WiFi is one of the things that often goes down. Not connecting to any network, and then having to either re-flash the phone or factory reset it and then have WiFi not connect all over again. This went on for a couple of weeks when I read about CM 12 and that it was being released in Beta for XL. I immediately grabbed the zip, but I did not flash it for a long time after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finally flashed it, the WiFi didn’t work and I had to peek around a bit and reflash it a sizable number of times before I could get it working. But I did get it working and I have been using it for some time now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta 6 has been released but I have not yet flashed it onto the phone. I probably won’t for some more time. (With Mid Semester approaching, I need to stop doing everything except study! :P)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Team AUV IIT KGP (http://github.com/auviitkgp), we have made our first year recruitments for all the three teams (Mechanical, Embedded and beloved &lt;strong&gt;Software&lt;/strong&gt;, which I belong to!)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Setting up a new Linux Machine</title>
   <link href="/2014/12/15/setting-up-a-new-machine"/>
   <updated>2014-12-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/12/15/setting-up-a-new-machine</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Soon after getting acquainted with Vim, I had to change my machine. My old Toshiba, with 3 Gigs of RAM and an Intel Pentium at it’s heart, had a broken display, and it was not cutting it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new machine is armed with 4 Gigs of RAM, a 4th Gen i5, and 2 GB of AMD Radeon Graphics. It came pre-installed with Windows 8.1. And when I bought it, I had all the intention required to change the operating system to something faster and much more customisable and useful for stuff like Git, Rails and all else, Of course, Ubuntu!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My config on the old laptop was perfect and well toned. Over the past year and a half, I had tweaked each part of the machine, starting from the shell, which changed to zsh recently, right to the complicated dependencies of ROS Hydro. Also, I was moving from Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 14.04, Long Term Suppor versions of the operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was when I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by Zach Holman regarding the dotfiles tha make up a machine’s configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, I also looked at &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotfiles.github.io&quot;&gt;dotfiles.github.io&lt;/a&gt;, which basically told me how to get started. I was not able to understand most of the resources there. And basically, how symlinks worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I started reading up on symlinks and within an hour or so, I had a working copy of my own dotfiles repository ready. Fork it on GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/icyflame/dotfiles&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, My color scheme, my vimrc (Vim being the editor in which I do most of the editing work now, See my praise for Vim in the previous post!), and my zshrc alongwith the gitconfig and global gitignore file. I also came up with an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;install.sh&lt;/code&gt; bash script that would copy these files and symlink them to the main files. Along the way, learning a lot about bash programming. (It’s been on my todo list for quite some time now!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the configuration was setup, I set about installing all the core packages. (vim, git-core, vlc, chromium etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, I had to setup ROS, this time, it was the indigo distribution though. Whole of AUV is moving from Hydro to Indigo, this winter. They have started working on the next release (called “Jade”). We guess it will be atleast one more year before they get ready to ship it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ROS Indigo installaton was pleasant, and surprisingly, I didn’t run into any major walls. The installation was smooth, and I was able to get everything working. (The only problem was when I had to do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo &quot;source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash&quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;. I had to change all the occurences of bash to zsh in this line! so I had to add the line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.zsh&lt;/code&gt; to my &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;. And everything was working good (Once I had configured the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ROS_WORKSPACE&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ROS_PACKAGE_PATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variables)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, about 2 hours in, I was completely setup, except for a couple of problems here and there, I was more than happy with my new laptop! (The Dell Inspiron 5547, which apparently has some kind of “official” support from Canonical, because of which all the drivers were there and everything was working!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we (at AUV) have started using Telegram, an open-source messenger. And as with almost all open source ventures, it has a large community of developers, who have created messenger clients for every device out there. Yes, everything. Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Windows PC, Mac OS X and Linux. So, hopefully, no more reaching to your phone to reply to that message from your colleague. (Footnote: The Android App and the Ubuntu Desktop Client are amazing. They just WORK!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been reading an &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulmillr.com/posts/the-story-of-telegram/&quot;&gt;interesting article&lt;/a&gt; about why Telegram is secure and if it is secure at all, it makes for some productive discussion over coffee with people interested in Tech and Information Security!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Configuring Vim and more!</title>
   <link href="/2014/12/11/Configuring-vim-and-more"/>
   <updated>2014-12-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/12/11/Configuring-vim-and-more</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Fall semester ended on Dec 28th. And after that a lot of things have happenned. It’s been a long time since I wrote a post, because I have hardly had any time, since then. I am leaving for home day after tomorrow. And now finally, all the tasks are moving into “pack-up” phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been many changes to my development environment in these two weeks. The most important is the integration of Vim into the scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some time now, I have been trying to get into this amazing command line editor that almost everyone seems to love so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost always, whenever I started using Vim, I got frustrated and left it to go back to my beloved Sublime Text, which was just so much easier to use and a Powerhorse in it’s own right. I obviously believed that there was no feature of Vim, that could ever trump the usage of Sublime Text as the primary editor. All the simple Keybindings. So, easy to understand. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ctrl + V&lt;/code&gt; to paste, and not the EXTRA &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shift&lt;/code&gt; that had to be pressed in vim. (God knows how you copy text inside a file, hell, There isn’t even an obvious way to highlight text.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, This time, I was determined. I had to learn this editor which was touted as the fastest and the editor with a huge community that built plugins for it which made the editor better then everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I set out to do with Vim, was edit HTML. Setting up the two space tab and indent size was my first great battle with Vim. I created a new list on &lt;a href=&quot;https://kippt.com/icyflame/vim-config&quot;&gt;Kippt&lt;/a&gt;. This list was going to be my database where I would dump all the resources that I found regarding Vim. And this particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://kippt.com/icyflame/vim-config/clips/23735598&quot;&gt;clip&lt;/a&gt; (I call it this for no better word)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I was faced with an even harder problem at hand. When I was editing, the tags were automatically indented and closing tags were unindented to give a pretty format. But what about Python, the dread language that didn’t have closing tags. I am equally passionate about HTML, Python, Ruby and C++. And I wanted an editor which was a good bet for all of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning again to the web, I got the solution pretty fast. My first encounter with Vim Plugin. The python.vim file, which I naively copied into &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.vim/ftplugin&lt;/code&gt;. I say naively because now I know that the only way to keep Vim portable is to use something like Vundle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, there is another very very common feature that almost all people who write serious code, and believe that code should look good and do great things do all the time is “AUTO-INDENT”. And in Sublime Text, I had bound this to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ctrl I&lt;/code&gt;. So Indenting the whole file took just &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ctrl A&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ctrl I&lt;/code&gt;. Boom, Everything was well indented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; operator was obviously great, or so everyone on Stack Overflow seemed to think, but it didn’t work for me. Not the first time around, Not the second time and not a lot of times after that. It turned out that I hadn’t turned on the Filetype plugin which was through how the indent operation worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few more tweaks and I had indentation totally cracked! I immediately patted myself on the back on having reached the first bridge to the land of Vim Users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handily, I had a couple of web applications that I was working on, and both of them were mostly basic FrontEnd pages. And there wasn’t much file navigation to be done, I struggled through an half-an-hour task for 2 hours, but made it through. Vim had thrown hell at me, and I had waded through all of that to reach the end of my first full blown task in Vim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the process, I had learned a lot about Vim. Pasting text properly, the weird nomenclature of calling copying text yanking and so on. (Actually, now I am starting to think that it is not really that weird or out of place, but definitely they could have called it copying! :P )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found about Vim Shorthand. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dit&lt;/code&gt; for deleting the content inside tags. And similarly, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vit&lt;/code&gt;. And the equivalent, when replacing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; for tags with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; for double quotes, or basically just any character, the text between two occurences of which we wanted to change stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was good. And I think this is one of the most powerful features of an editor. And what other editors, (Like my beloved Sublime Text) did using plugins, Vim did out of the box, and that box had a lot of computers in it (Servers, through Chromebooks with PocketLinux) (This is touted as Vim Portabality.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after this, I started using Vim for everything from programming projects to even typing Git commit messages. (I used to type in Nano and the 72 character limit on oneline in Vim was very helpful, and I have totally fallen in love with it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found out the great capabilities of Vim in Find-And-Replace. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; operator, and the usage of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;-like syntax from inside the editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Vim is one of the best editors out there. It is blazing fast, and if you love the terminal, and hate having to move your hand from the home row to either a trackpad or a moust kept beside your keyboard, Vim is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you love mouses, then you would probably not like Vim as much, but even then, it is worth a try. In fact, Vim is worth more than a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently, I have installed Vundle, and I am preparing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; repository at &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/icyflame/config&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gmail 5.0 (Material Design Update) is here!</title>
   <link href="/2014/11/02/gmail-5-is-here"/>
   <updated>2014-11-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/11/02/gmail-5-is-here</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, Gmail 5.0, was probably the one release of Gmail, which I was most eager for. Before this, almost always, the updates have been merely “behind the scenes”. Slight bug-fixes, fixing crashes etc. But this was different, this brought on a totally new and fresh material design template to the one app on Android which I used the most!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few days, there have been many updates for the Google apps on my Nexus 7, and all of them have been updated with the Material Design guidelines, and now, Google+ actually makes sense. I have been using it often to check out articles and stuff shared by Coursera, and other such firms, but basically, I am kinda hooked on to Google+. For the first time since it was launched, G+ is fun to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the time it was launched, G+ had always been super cool and super fast, far faster than Facebook, and it had a very fresh design, the cards, the comments being toggled all the time, and the best transition animations, ensured that it was fun to use, but without a lot of friends on it, and a confusing “add to circles” button, where you didn’t really understand if you were doing the Facebook FR or the Twitter Follow, made it tough to use and understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, adding to circles has been pushed to the background, following is here, as usual! And of course, the concept of friends hasn’t really been picked up, but I think the add to circles button is making sense to many more people after the recent update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to Gmail, one of the things that is very good on the new Gmail app, is the interface for Tablets, essentially, the difference between the interfaces for phones and tablets. This time, even the portrait app is different for tablets and phones. In the portrait app for tablets, an extra column ensures that you have a look at the three tabs (Forums, Social, Promotions etc) right at your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/kyGTWIs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the landscape view is just “Beautiful”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/C4SWwBB.png&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landscape and portrait views for the 4.5” screen on my phone are the same. And pretty plain, much like the previous Gmail Version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/S3Ggw6M.png&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are real images, shot from the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the APK for this app &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/gmail/gmail-5-0-1520254-apk/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The APK has been signed by Google, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ubuntu for Devices (And then back to stock Android!)</title>
   <link href="/2014/10/27/ubuntu-for-devices"/>
   <updated>2014-10-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/10/27/ubuntu-for-devices</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And then, I decided that my beloved Nexus 7 (2012 version, the device is called “grouper” for some mysterious reason!), had remained with stock Android for too long, and that it needed to go out there and explore the world of flashing custom ROMs, and experiencing other OSs. So, I opened up the Ubuntu for Devices installation guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The webpage was familiar, I had been there before a lot of times, almost always, with the intention of flashing Ubuntu onto my Tablet, but always, coming up with some excuse to not do so. This time I was determined! I had backed up everything using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;adb&lt;/code&gt; command line utility from my Ubuntu 12.04 laptop, and anyway, it wasn’t data loss that I was worried about. Almost all my data was either on my laptop or the cloud, the Nexus 7 was just a play device, and didn’t have much of any use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the backup, I noted the build number, the device name and one other thing, using a script that they had given. Once that was done, I had to run the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ubuntu-device-flash&lt;/code&gt; command. This I believed would take time, because it was going to flash a complete operating system onto the tablet. I had selected the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; channel for installation, it said that the version of Ubuntu was 13.10, and that it was “stable”. And well, since all developers are very stingy about moving from bleeding edge to “stable”, I was pretty sure that it was the best thing that I could get for my tablet, atleast at the first iteration. So, once the command started, it started downloading some system images to flash into the device, this took some time, about 15 minutes or so. But once this was done, within 4 minutes or so, The device had been flashed, and the myseteriously the device booted into recovery, and now it was CWM recovery. I had stock recovery in the beginning, now that recovery was gone, and CWM had come in. The recovery was in some screen, and it was saying something that I didn’t get and didn’t think to write down either. I simply selected the “Go Back” option that was there on the screen. Once I had selected that, the device powered down, and the screen was blank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this wasn’t something I had expected, I had expected some kind of protest or an Ubuntu splash screen or something of the sort that you see when you install or startup an OS for the first time!. I powered the tablet back on. I saw the Google screen with a small Unlocked symbol at the bottom of the screen, indicating that my Bootloader had been unlocked. (This was one of the easiest steps of the process. Simply run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fastboot oem unlock&lt;/code&gt; with root privileges, and boom, The bootloader was unlocked. This is sunlike the bootloader unlocking procedure of all the other non-Nexus phones and tablets, which have a long and tiring process!) After this google splash screen, I got my first look at Ubuntu. The lock screen. The circular slide-type thing, which I couldn’t really figure out what it did. And when I swyped from the right edge, I saw the home screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first look was pretty plain. There wasn’t much on the screen, the icons were not sharp, they were slightly blurred, and I don’t know why. The device didn’t pester me for my name and Account credentials, the OS simply started. But one thing that I noticed was that the animations, and the transisitons and almost everything was slow. They never hung up, but they were just slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just when I was thinking that maybe I had cracked Ubuntu, without breaking anything, I swyped in from the left edge to go back home, and boom! The screen started flickering, this reminded me of my days playing with the desktop computer back home, which also used to flicker whenever I loaded Ubuntu on it. So, once this was here, just I had expected, the device didn’t respond, so again, I switched it off and back on again. Now, I wanted to try the browser, so I switched on Wifi on it. I tried a lot to connect to a network, but I never could get it working. The Gmail app was installed, but I couldn’t use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost an hour after I had installed Ubuntu, I decided that it wasn’t worth it, probably because I had installed 13.10, or maybe just because I had installed Ubuntu on the tablet! ( &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; The image that I used was for the Nexus 7 (2013) version, which has a faster processor, but nothing significantly different anywhere else, and generally, it is just found that stuff that works on 2013 works on 2012 too!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I wanted to move back to Android. But, while I was at it, I decided, that probably I should give Android L (named “Lollipop”) a try. So, I downloaded the archive for Lollipop and followed all the instructions at that preview installation page, and found that I was getting an error, again and again. It was saying &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;system.img not found&lt;/code&gt;, when actually, it was present. I didn’t know how to fix it, and I decided to sleep on it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, I was at the terminal, the tablet was in fastboot and the android BOT was lying on it’s back, with it’s stomach open! I tried it again, and then, searched the internet for answers, I got a couple of them, but none which solved the problem. So, I left it. I decided to just load KitKat and either wait for the official Lollipop release or flash it once it’s images were up on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images&quot;&gt;factory images&lt;/a&gt; page. meanwhile, I was slightly worried because the tablet was not starting up anymore. It was in fastboot and then just kept going off and coming back on, never going into either Ubuntu or Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, seeing all this, I was pretty worried that, as one poster put it aptly on an XDA forum, “Royally screwed up my Nexus 7”. But I still had hope, and I believed that things would get solved, once I flashed the stock android back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Now again I went to the factory images page, and downloaded the factory reset image for my device “nakasi”. And again, ran the flash-all.sh script present inside the extracted directory, and the process started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning it erased all the partitions, and then it wrote the boot, recovery, system, and userdata partition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This userdata partition went on to create trouble, As the terminal was stuck at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sending userdata (137563 KB)&lt;/code&gt;. It was taking too much time, and I was sure that it had hung up, so I disconnected the device, and started it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much to my delight, the google splash screen was followed by the four dots of Nexus whirling and coalescing. I was pretty sure that the tablet would start up now, but then, I met a screen that asked me to enter a password to decrypt the userdata. This was unexpected because I hadn’t ever entered any password, and now I didn’t know what to write there. I tried a couple of passwords, but nothing seemed to work. And then I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.androidcentral.com/google-nexus-7-tablet-2012/289286-nexus-7-type-password-decrypt-storage.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, a hilarious discussion about whether or not the OP had a stolen Nexus 7 or not! People had come to the screen I had just because their tablet had incidentally switched off, so I was happy that I could atleast say that I was tweaking with it when I ended up at that screen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This didn’t give me the answer, but I was sure that doing it again would be beneficial, so I started it off again and then waited. When I came back to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sending userdata&lt;/code&gt; step, as before, the screen freezed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/272542/stuck-on-sending-userdata-137526-kb&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, which indirectly told me to swtich off the device while it was connected to the computer, and then, it worked for the OP. So, I did exactly that. And then, when I restarted the tablet, Boom! I was asked for my preferred language, and basically I was on the Android, “First Setup” screen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set it up, and started restoring stuff from my account on the cloud, and as of this moment, the tablet is still downloading and updating all of my apps, and books and almost everything that was there on my tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just in case you are interested I have posted the whole LOG file &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/icyflame/97d3c29f62278790be50&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This is the log for the Ubuntu installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnet.com/how-to/android-5-0-lollipop-update-list/&quot;&gt;this article on CNET&lt;/a&gt;, Lollipop will be pushed for Nexus 4, 5, 7 and 10. So, chances are that I will get Lollipop for the 2012 version, but even if I don’t, I am confident enough, (now!) that, I will flash it as soon as the image is up on the factory images page!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>(Ruby) Gems are powerful!</title>
   <link href="/2014/10/10/gems-are-powerful"/>
   <updated>2014-10-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/10/10/gems-are-powerful</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, after my last post, I came back to campus, this Monday! And once I came back to the campus, I was behind a proxy again. This ensures that there is no easy way (as for now, I don’t know any way at all) to SSH with servers outside. So, Git SSH, Heroku SSH everything’s gone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I am pretty convinced that I made the most of my 6 days at home, where there were no proxies, just pure internet access!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, I had also, configured three basic Ruby Gems, which I am determined to use in all my successive projects and one Gem which was a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, starting with the three that worked perfectly well, they were &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass#bootstrap-for-sass---&quot;&gt;Bootstrap SASS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plataformatec/devise&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://activeadmin.info/&quot;&gt;ActiveAdmin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bootstrap SASS is simply the SASS port for Bootstrap, and since bootstrap is the way to go (&amp;lt;3 @mdo), for all things front end, It has to be there. Although, SASS rails is included by default in the Gemfile of a new Ruby app when you create it, I would also like these three to be added and the first run of the bundle install to take place as soon as I create the app. I am trying to automate this process, by a simple Bash script which will append the three required lines to the Gemfile, and then run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt; and then do some other configuration stuff. I am documenting all the steps in creating a new RoR app, in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/icyflame/29c4a04515e8f9063bb7&quot;&gt;Gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second gem does stuff that just any real world project can’t do without. &lt;strong&gt;Devise : Authentication&lt;/strong&gt; First and foremost, I just wanna say this, Devise has one of the best README’s ever written. The README is great, for the beginner in Devise, and also, for a beginner of Rails. It is amazingly well written, and contains almost everything that one requires right when one starts to use Devise. How to create new devise models, how to integrate devise with old ones. Probably the one thing that I would really love to see on the devise README is how to permit extra parameters in a Devise Sign Up. This is probably one of the very few things that I had to google and could not get on their README, when I first started using Devise. I will of course, be adding this piece of Information to my own Gist, as I believe that if someone is being authenticated, then there is a lot of metadata, except just the email and the password that I would probably wanna store in the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the third and final Gem which was the one Gem which I didn’t get right the first time was ActiveAdmin. I started using RailsAdmin, and that was a huge mistake, because for some reason, RailsAdmin does not show all the fields that are there in a particular table. It almost always ignores the Password field, and sometimes, some other fields like email ID’s etc. It was one of the Gems that was shown right at the top of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/rails_admin_interfaces&quot;&gt;Ruby Toolbox Page for Administration&lt;/a&gt;. Which was probably the reason I picked it out, but it didn’t work out well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter, ActiveAdmin. And yeah, I knew I had found the one I wanted to use! ActiveAdmin was clean, and it was actually perfect. Just a couple of hours ago, I ran into a brickwall, trying to create a record using ActiveAdmin’s create interface, but then, I have not read the complete documentation. I am pretty sure I saw how to do this, and I will be catching up on it soon. One of the peculiar things that happenned after I installed ActiveAdmin was that it’s CSS and JS was being included everywhere. This was a stupid mistake. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;require_tree&lt;/code&gt; in both the application.css and the application.js files, was placed in the last lines of the comments, and just when I was beginning to wonder what they did, I found out. (Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/a/10321125/2080089&quot;&gt;stack overflow&lt;/a&gt; of course.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, having found the power of Ruby Gems, I am totally addicted (in some sense of the word!) to Ruby on Rails!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psst psst, The &lt;a href=&quot;http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html&quot;&gt;getting started with RoR&lt;/a&gt; guide is amazing. It’s the best place to start. Have I mentioned that in one of my initial posts already? :D&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ship it!</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/30/deployment"/>
   <updated>2014-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/09/30/deployment</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, after the previous post, which actually caught the attention of the people at Travis CI, I am
back with the next part of the application lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/5162296267884544000&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2014-09-29-travis-ci-conversation-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping!&lt;/strong&gt; Although, the word is simple, and the process is pretty easy to understand, it was something that I obviously, had never done before, and didn’t have any idea what it meant either. Because, till now, I have worked with PHP and deploying PHP is simply copying the files onto a server that supports PHP hosting (whatever that means!). Rails, though, was a different game, altogether!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;, seemed to be the platform of choice, on the internet. So, I went through the Heroku Getting started for deploying rails guide. This guide itself was very informative, and surprisingly, easy to follow. There were some issues that I did face in the process, I will be detailing some of them below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSH&lt;/strong&gt; Back on campus, since we were behind Proxy servers, which listen on port 8080, Heroku is not easy to setup from the terminal. I have not yet found out how to do it, but I believe that it can be done, and I will be asking some of the people I know for some ways to work around the proxies and get stuff done! But, here, at home, I am connected to the internet. And Proxy servers DO NOT exist! So, SSH is possible. And some time before, when I tried to follow this same guide from campus, I found that you could push to heroku only using SSH. I had given up on campus, but out here, it’s a new day and I could try again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSH was easy to setup, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh-keygen -t rsa&lt;/code&gt; created the public key and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku keys:clear&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku keys:add&lt;/code&gt; completed the process. Running &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku create&lt;/code&gt; configred the rails app, and then came the moment of truth, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git push heroku master&lt;/code&gt;. And bam! I ran into &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Permission denied (publickey)&lt;/code&gt;. It was a two line error message, and told me exactly nothing about the problem that the application was facing, so I delved into the internet and &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; (duh!) came to my rescue. &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4269922/permission-denied-publickey-when-deploying-heroku-code-fatal-the-remote-end&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; question told me what needed to be done. So, I did what the accepted answer told me to do, but it didn’t work for a couple of times. After some time of tinkering around with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;keys:clear&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;keys:add&lt;/code&gt; commands, it worked for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bam! Second checkpost! &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sqlite is not supported on heroku&lt;/code&gt;. This was an error that went on to give me quite some pain! Sqlite is the database of choice in development environments, especially in Rails and Django, all the setup is done when the application is created. But at the production level, obviously, I couldn’t expect Heroku to deploy my database on sqlite. But I naively believed that either Heroku or Rails, would automagically handle it, Alas, it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://devcenter.heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Heroku Dev Center&lt;/a&gt;. And stack overflow, of course! I got the solution after some amount of digging around. &lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sqlite3&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; post on the Heroku Dev Center dedicated to sqlite, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21297160/detected-sqlite3-gem-which-is-not-supported-on-heroku&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; question on stack overflow, showed me the way. I learned about grouping gems in the Gemfile. And after doing what the DevCenter guide told me to do, I made it work. And whoa! It worked. The application was deployed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://calm-headland-9735.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;http://calm-headland-9735.herokuapp.com&lt;/a&gt; (where it is still deployed!). But there was one thing to be fixed as of now. The bootstrap elements were not rendering properly. It was like bootstrap was not loaded at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seemed to be easy to fix, and it was easy! &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16271696/cant-get-css-working-on-heroku-using-rails-4-with-bootstrap-saas-gem&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; question immediately showed me what to do! Just the addition of the four lines at the beginning of this answer to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;production.rb&lt;/code&gt; environment file, fixed the problem. And the second push worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, I learned that you push from the local branch &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deploy&lt;/code&gt; to the remote branch &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; by using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git push heroku deploy:master&lt;/code&gt;, so that at the other end, the local deploy branch is merged with remote:master on arrival. This seemed to be cool. But I am still not clear whether the conflict management at Heroku’s end is similar to how git does it, because if it is, then I would have expected some notification from Heroku, asking to me to fix all the conflicts, or push something that didn’t conflict with their copy of the repository. I am trying to find more stuff about this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, all through this process, Travis CI was continously building. And that was awesome. Also, Travis also built new branches pushed to the repository, so the deploy branch was being built continously whenever I pushed to it on Github. I also created a tag somewhere during this process, and even this tag was built by Travis!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; I intend this post to be a collection of all the stuff that I needed to make Rails applications work on Heroku!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Cracking Travis CI.</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/28/cracking-travis-ci"/>
   <updated>2014-09-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/09/28/cracking-travis-ci</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;About a month into this semester, I found out that &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/&quot;&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; is actually free for open source projects. And since all of my projects were open source, and I had already seen those great looking &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/icyflame/alum-cell-blog-rails&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/icyflame/alum-cell-blog-rails.svg?branch=master&quot; alt=&quot;Build Status&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; badges on some repositories, I was excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a project was something new for me. Generally, all I really cared about was how it rendered on the screen, but building a projects, and running Unit Tests (which was the single most intimidating thing according to me) was new and something that waited to be explored! So, I set out on the journey to crack Travis CI and get the above badge on the README files of one of my repositories as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naive as ever, I tried to start with a PHP project. Although, right at the beginning the process seemed to be simple, add a .travis.yaml YAML file and push a commit to GitHub and wait for Travis CI to detect the commit and try to build the project at that commit, the process was obviously not so simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, there were some build errors which kept coming up, no matter how I changed the PHP project, the YAML file or the environment variables. And somewhere along the process I realised that since I was starting to get used to rails anyway, I should try it out with rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this I began with. Although, an empty project of rails was compiling, I was getting an error called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Parameter Missin&lt;/code&gt; when it was running the two tests &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test_should_get_create&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test_should_get_show&lt;/code&gt;. I didn’t really understand what was going on, since I had no idea what the architecture of the whole thing was, and I had no insight into the build lifecycle. I had stared at the build console output for a couple of hours, but at the end of the day, I just decided that I would figure it out later and ditched it and went on learning rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, (is my first day back at home, during the Durga Puja vacations), I designed to build a rails port for the Create Together application that I had already written using Code Igniter in PHP. It seemed to make more sense to start writing an application that I had already built and knew exactly how I wanted it to work, before trying to build a compeltely new application from scratch. I had tried to build something up from scratch, but then, I realised that I didn’t know enough Rails to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, around 2 in the afternoon, today, I sat down and started working on the app. I got out my pen and paper and literally drew a diagram of what all resources I would have (Rails lingo!) and the connection between all these resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had this on paper (This was the first time I was actually drawing something before developing, everytime I thought of doing this before today, I ended up ditching it because it just seemed to take much more time than I would have spent if I had simply started developing. But today was different, I was learning rails for the first time, and I wanted to do it right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, about three hours into the endeavour. I had a basic architecture up and running, I could add administrators and contributors, I had decided to queue up posts for a little later because posts were tied with contributors from the inside and  this was something that I had to digest before I could start coding it. Somewhere along the line, I realised that since, I was all about doing this right, shouldn’t I also try to get Travis CI to work so that I could really claim that I knew the complete application lifecycle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I created a github repository and pushed the offline git repository online to GitHUb and configured Travis CI with the basic .travis.yml file that’s on the documentation for Ruby, and built the project. Voila, build failed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next five builds, the build kept failing. The error was the same, exactly the same. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Parameter Missing&lt;/code&gt;. So, then again, I started reading up about rails tests and how unit tests were written. After the sixth build, I had delved deep into the problem and I was pretty sure that I was pretty close to the solution! Alas, I was mistaken. It would take me about 40 minutes to figure out what the problem was, and another half an hour to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20 minutes into the internet effort, I was convinced that the issue was with the test cases. One of the test cases that was there somewhere in my repository was creating an issue, and thus, Travis was not showing a successful build, because the only thing that Travis can look at is the response that the test cases give him, so as to assert whether or not the project is good to be deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SO, now, for the first time, since I started writing Rails, I went into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test/&lt;/code&gt; folder in my repository, there was something called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fixtures&lt;/code&gt;, which I read about on the official Rails unit testing documentation, and that was clear, and there were two other things &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;models/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;controllers/&lt;/code&gt;, tests for the models and the controller classes. I delved into models, because in the back of my mind, I had the (wrong) notion that everything related to parameters and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;record not found&lt;/code&gt; stuff would be an issue inside the model and not inside the controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, I was proved wrong (I was almost frustrated enough to ditch everything and go back to the application), when suddenly, I found three controller test files I had never seen before, and in this file, I could see the root of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay! I found the problem! But now, I had to fix it. The simplest fix was obvious, just comment out the code causing the issues, I was sure what was the problem and indeed, it solved the problem (I ran &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rake&lt;/code&gt; on my machine to check if all the test cases were compiling with the two test cases commented out, and they did!), But I wasn’t really sure if that’s how Travis did it, and I was afraid that one more commit gone wrong would simply break the repository and I would have to find a solution again, so, now that I had found out that it was the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; method which was being called without the appropriate parameters that was causing the problems, I did a simple search &lt;strong&gt;passing parameter to get method rails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search results were not what I expected, because I couldn’t find any documentation on the get method at all. I don’t know if my key was wrong or what, but it just wasn’t there. So, scrouge around the beach, for half an hour more and I did find the answer to my problem on &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1430247/passing-parameters-in-rails-redirect-to&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; stack overflow question. It wasn’t really what I was looking for, as it gave information about the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;redirect_to&lt;/code&gt; function and not the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; method, but I had to make do, and I just tried to replace the two keywords, and after some tinkering around I found the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now I have a passing &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/icyflame/alum-cell-blog-rails/builds&quot;&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;! And I have embedded the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;build passing&lt;/code&gt; badge on my repositorys readme! yay! mission accomplished!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are interested, or God forbid, if you are facing this problem, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/alum-cell-blog-rails/commit/e3cab28b26393ab6375d009da529d1670fa6132a&quot;&gt;git diff&lt;/a&gt;. I am sure that this is as verbose as it gets. And if you don’t get it, (I am afraid I might not, in case I see it after a few weeks), comment down below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This is a confused post, I know, probably because I am kinda excited right now. But I may give out another post explaining exactly what the problem was, alongwith error logs and git diffs, and everything that I went through in much more detail, later this week!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Going Home</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/25/going-home"/>
   <updated>2014-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/09/25/going-home</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s that time of the Fall semester again. About 70 days ago, we came back and started second year (Yay!). And now we are going back, “The Durga Puja Vacations.”, and unlike last year, (when it was a badly scheduled 5 day holiday), this year it is 5 weekdays, and with the two weekends, preceding it and succeeding it, you learn to put them all together, and get 9 days out of it! The campus is slowly emptying out, those without labs, would mostly have left the campus, ( the three days after mid-semester exams, hardly matter! :P )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still here. Leaving tomorrow. It would be a 26 hour train journey to Chennai (yeah, new home!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mid Semester exam is the one other thing that I haven’t really talked about yet. But I am not even sure if I wanna talk about it at all. I guess I should just wait till the results to come out! (I am so not looking forward to Fluid Mechanics.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few days, have been very hectic. After my last post, there were two exams to go (one of them was coincidentally, Fluid Mechanics!), and they were in quick succession, so I have been pretty up to my neck in fluid’s and differential equations! And now, well, Now I watched the Keynote of the September 2014 Event, the iPhone 6 release! The new iPhone has a barometer in it, Wow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one last thing, before I go into no-internet land for about 30 hours! Front-end is cool. Actually, writing front-end is. After setting up Sass, CSS became cool. And after finding CSS Animations, The whole “Gradually-do-whatever-you-wanna-do” thing caught fire. Like, literally!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been writing the Project Pages for Create Together and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/assyst&quot;&gt;Assyst&lt;/a&gt; (Yes! I found a name that makes sense!). The create together project page is &lt;a href=&quot;http://icyflame.github.io/create-together&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;! And it’s pretty simple and all that, but I kinda like it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working on the Assyst page, and I hope it get’s done soon! After that, I would probably move back to rails, and try to get a feel for it!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>4 exams, three days.</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/18/almost-like-jee"/>

   <id>/2014/09/18/almost-like-jee</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Four exams, two of which were “Science of Living Systems” and “Environmental Science” (Who thought we would have to study these in college! :/ ). And the other two were Dynamics and Transform Calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, at the very beginning, I was pretty afraid of Dynamics, (Analysing moving parts always freaked me out!), I turned out to love Dynamics, surprisingly! Transform Calculus, has always been great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I guess, the emphasis should be on the fact that, these papers were within a span of 72 hours. And in quick succession. Morning Afternoon, + 24 hours and +36 hours. Which was just bad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But somehow, it’s over, and we are up and running again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right about now, almost everyone started the countdown for Durga Puja vacations, starting next Friday, going till October 6th. And yes, everyone has tickets, and (almost) everyone is ready to shoot home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;meanwhile, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/code&gt; has me totally fascinated! The one thing that has blown me away, totally, uptill now, is how much of the work Ruby does for you. And once you have it setup, there’s hardly anything else to be done. Create controllers, models and views, everything with one command. Moving from CodeIgniter to Rails, has been a freeing experience. I need to type less. Everything is just so obvious. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Model.delete&lt;/code&gt; deletes the record that is given to it as a parameter, and that is just so obvious. If &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;course&lt;/code&gt; is a variable and I redirect to it, then it will go to the show page of the controller. And that is too good! because now, much like printing class objects in python, I don’t need to think whether I will end up with some Hex gibberish which I would be unable to understand, I just need to define the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; action for the controller object and there you are! I can see every variable in the same exact format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after this, somehow, working with Rails, I found the seamless Sass integration. Although I had never used Sass before, partly because I wasn’t really ready to set up a lot, but mostly because, I didn’t write a lot of CSS. But now, I wanted to do something pretty normal, I wanted the class &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;form-control&lt;/code&gt; which is the bootstrap class for input elements, to all the form input elements, throughout the application. If I am using a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;form input&lt;/code&gt; element, then it should have the form-control class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set out on a voyage, and returned with the treasure. Although, I had to add stuff to the Gemfile and then run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt;, to install the bootstrap sass dependency, I was victorious! I had figured out how to import the bootstrap sass library and also &lt;strong&gt;truly&lt;/strong&gt; inherit classes using Sass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Now, I am set up to do a lot! Although, I have an application in mind, I don’t really know, if I am gonna start out right away, or if I am gonna give some more time to learning more about Ruby and it’s capabilities, which truly, &lt;strong&gt;seem to be endless.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Installed Ruby. Yay!</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/15/installing-ruby"/>
   <updated>2014-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/09/15/installing-ruby</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Often called, the best language to develop web applications, Rails, has pretty much been a stranger to me, much to my disbelief (at not being able to install a simple package on my machine, even after asking so many other people) and unhappiness (I  really do wanted to get on board, with the language that was being used in SO many web applications, starting right from GitHub! [ Which is probably the best web application out there! ]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I have it installed. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I installed Ruby, from source, (because &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; didn’t work, and I didn’t wanna debug.) Fingers-crossed, I fired up the first command. 
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rails new blog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of ideas for the application that I wanna create, but the get started guide, has almost always gotten me exactly where I wanted to be, in all the languages that I have ever tried to learn (with the exception of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.djangoproject.com&quot;&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;, which, unfortuately, I never got! Although, I tried a lot, and even completed the first page of the tutorial, for some reason, on my machine, the admin page, which is described right at the beginning of the next page just refuses to display. And thus, I was &lt;strong&gt;stone-walled&lt;/strong&gt; right there.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it worked. I had a new app, but not without any baggage though, it said something like &lt;strong&gt;I wanna install &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/code&gt;, so enter your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; password&lt;/strong&gt;, I did that willingly. I have come to trust CLIs that ask me for my &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; passwords! (At some point, during the ruby installation, I was so frustrated, I typed exactly what it wanted me to.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, later, I found that there were two major reasons for this installation fiasco, that I was getting stuck in too often, these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My machine runs Ubuntu 12.04.&lt;/strong&gt; Although, officially, support is there upto April 2015, a lot of packages are broken, I almost always get &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;You have held broken packages&lt;/code&gt; when I try to install a new package, and I couldn’t figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proxy servers.&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, internet access through proxy servers, sucks, right? Nothing really is simple anymore. You need to go into that settings tab in every internet related application you download and check that checkbox saying &lt;strong&gt;Proxy Setting: Manual&lt;/strong&gt; and enter a 10 digit IP address, that you have in your head, by the fourth day that you spend on campus!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 hours from now, I will be sitting inside an examination hall, giving the Mid Semester examination for “Science of Living Systems”, and whoa! I am so excited about that! -_- (Although, I know smilies won’t be rendered, I just couldn’t help myself right there!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And ironically, I got &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icyflame/learn-rails&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Homeland. Thriller, but then, it's simply frustrating</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every time that Carrie is sure that something is going to happen, that thing obviously doesn’t happen, but it is basically because Brody is on both sides of the play. And he knows what’s going on here. Having recently completed Season 1, and appalled at the fact that Carrie was fired from the CIA, because of something that was true, but just didn’t play out as she had put it, and having seen the second episode of the second season, I believe, that this is Carrie’s redemption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SD Card, containing the Video that Brody had recorded thinking that he is going to die due to the suicide bomb, is now with Saul. And although, I have never seen what’s on the video (it would probably be played in the next episode!), I am pretty sure it must be pretty damn incriminating. But I don’t really know if that’s enough to get Carrie her job back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning from Beirut, Carrie is pretty much shocked and I believe slightly happy too, after all she was right about her source. And the two chases in Beirut, were enough to get anyone’s adrenaline shooting. David Estes still doesn’t trust her, and I really can’t figure him out, or the Vice President. Why the heck does he keep showing everything to Brody?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one text message from Brody to Nazir, pretty much stopped the season from ending at the episode yesterday, but it was interesting nonetheless, nail-biting, even. I am pretty sure that the next thing Saul is gonna do is check if Brody was in on the operation, and without Carrie in the scene, and coming from Saul, David Estes will have to accept whatever he says to be credible enough, to move on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, well, I really do want to see Carrie back in the Agency. Working with Saul. And now that she has reached some kind of a mid-way between fixed and not-fixed, due to her being bi-polar, This seems to be on the Horizon for now!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Setup. Ready to Roll!</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And finally, Hyde is setup. Now, the scene looks like this. Jekyll, powering the blog, Hyde, powering everything that gets rendered, and controls how it renders, the posts themselves hosted on GitHub (of course!), and me, pushing the posts from my machine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Web Browsers, No Usernames, and/or Passwords! jekyll is great. I wish I had taken the time to set it up sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup was not really the most painless one that I have ever done, but it was good. One of the major problems which I faced was simply that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post.url&lt;/code&gt; was not being calculated properly, because, the function itself returned the URL of the post, but prefixed it with a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, and what that meant was GitHub went to the root of the website, instead of the present URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18427456/jekyll-using-relative-urls-for-post-url&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;. I got the answer, Actually, finding the issue itself took longer than finding the solution, once I knew what it was. Pretty silly really!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further problems arose, when I wanted to integrate &lt;a href=&quot;http://disqus.com&quot;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;. Not really a problem, just a speedbump. And integrating this was pretty easy again, adding disqus shortname, adding the universal embed code to the template, and add comments:true to the front matter of the one post that was already online, and boom! Disqus is up and running! (You should see it below too, if nothing is broken!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough about the setup. Now that it is done, the blogging must begin!&lt;/p&gt;
