  <p>I understand the economics behind advertising. Advertising can be used to subsidize
content. However, I refuse to accept that Bloomberg.com needs to show advertisements to a paying
subscriber.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This comes down to personal preference: If you believe that advertisements are a
net good and support the work that you are viewing “for free”, so be it. I do <strong>not</strong> believe that. If
I must pay for content that is ostensibly “free” by having my attention distracted by an
advertisement which I did not ask for and am not interested in, then I reserve the right to use
every tool in my arsenal to avoid seeing the advertisement. All of this is just a preamble to a
recent change I made in one of the central components that I use to browse the Internet: my DNS
server. I switched from Pi-hole, a popular adblocking DNS server, to CoreDNS and <a href="https://github.com/icyflame/blocker">a plugin for ad
blocking</a> which I wrote. This is a post about why I decided to <strong>reinvent the wheel.</strong></p>

<h1 id="why-should-you-run-your-own-dns-server">Why Should You Run Your Own DNS Server?</h1>

<p><img src="/public/img/dns-diagram-2022-06-12.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>DNS (Domain Name System) is a key part of the infrastructure that makes up the backbone of the
Internet. It is also the most decentralized part of it. Most people use a DNS server which is a few
kilometers away from them. Internet Service Providers (ISP) will generally send default
configuration to their clients which will point them to DNS servers run by the ISP. This allows the
ISP to make a list of websites that their users are using and possibly use it as leverage when
negotiating with service providers <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/how-netflix-works-with-isps-around-the-globe-to-deliver-a-great-viewing-experience">about preferential treatment</a>. However, the clients that users use
to browse the Internet (their web browser or their computer’s operating system) have the ability to
override this setting and specify their own DNS server. Public DNS servers have been on the rise:
Google’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8.8.8.8</code> and Cloudflare’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.1.1.1</code> are popular alternatives. These DNS servers have a
significant improvement: They are far more reliable compared to your local ISP’s DNS
server. However, data about your Internet traffic continues to be sent to <em>someone.</em> To make the
situation worse, DNS traffic is mostly served over UDP. UDP is an insecure protocol which does not
protect information in transit. (Not “HTTPS,” if you will.) So, your ISP <em>still</em> has access to the
list of websites you are visiting. The solution to all of these problems is <strong>hosting your own DNS
server on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a> computer</strong> inside your home. (A recent improvement over the old design of
UDP-based DNS is <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/">DNS-over-HTTPS</a>. This ensures that DNS traffic can not be snooped upon, in transit.)</p>

<p>So, there’s one advantage: <strong>Your DNS request, which contains the name of the website that you are
visiting, does not leave your home.</strong> Your ISP has no clue where your traffic is going. (They can
figure it out using the IP address that your packet is headed for, but this is harder and ISPs have
a tendency to aim for the low-hanging fruit and not spend <em>too</em> much time trying to track their
users, if the information is not handed to them on a platter.)</p>

<p>There is another advantage: <strong>If you don’t like the domain inside the DNS request, then you can stop
the request in its tracks and prevent the client from fetching what it wants to fetch.</strong> Your browser
loads a page (for example, a news website). The news website has a script which will call an
advertising server and request the ad which will be placed in the box in between paragraphs. If you
could identify <em>just</em> these requests to the advertising server and block them somehow, then the
website will not be able to show you ads!</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/dns-blocking-diagram-2022-06-12.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>One idea is to create a list of the IP addresses that are used by advertising servers around the
world and block any request which is bound to these servers. This is hard and not reliable enough
because IP addresses change a lot and the process for changing them can be easily automated.</p>

<p>Another idea is to list the domains which these servers are on and block any DNS request for these
domains! This approach is convenient and reliable: Changing domains is hard and even if domains are
changed, if you don’t want anything on the domain, then you can simply add the new domain to your
blocklist. (Changing domains is hard primarily because each new domain has to be registered with a
domain registrar and this requires a small fee. The fee must be paid and payment to vendors on
demand is hard to automate. Also, so few users are using ad-blocking DNS servers that the
return-on-investment for an automated domain changing system is limited.)</p>

<p>So, we have a good approach. But we are missing one key component: The list of domains which we want
to block. There are many excellent lists out there and I recommend <a href="https://oisd.nl/">this one</a>. It lists about 1
million domains and it is updated frequently. It is an aggregation of <a href="https://oisd.nl/includedlists">other lists</a> and works well. (I
have used it along with <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts">another list</a> for the past several months, and I have not had any domain
which I wanted to send traffic to blocked due to a domain being mistakenly added to the list.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>)</p>

<p>Now, we have a list of domains that we want to block and the approach that we are going to use to
block the domains (a DNS server which can look at this list and block requests which match a domain
in the blocklist.) Now, <strong>we need to search for the software which will implement our solution.</strong></p>

<h1 id="why-coredns">Why CoreDNS?</h1>

<p>There are many options. The most popular one is <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a>, I used it for a few months and realized
that I could not continue using it because I disagreed with its GUI-centric design philosophy and
the effect that this philosophy had on its purpose: being a good DNS server. CoreDNS is a DNS server
which puts plugins front-and-center and encourages its users to write their own plugins. It is
written in a programming language that I like and am familiar with, and I don’t mind maintaining a
plugin in the long term.</p>

<h2 id="pi-hole">Pi-hole</h2>

<p>Pi-hole is written in the programming language C. I chose it, as I believed that it was built for
running on a Raspberry Pi. (I did not research how it was built or why it would run well on a
Raspberry Pi.) It was fairly easy to set up on a Raspberry Pi. There were some manual steps during
the setup process and it could not be fully automated. However, this was not a big problem for me
because I did not believe that I would need to repeat this setup process.</p>

<p>I started noticing problems with Pi-hole almost immediately after setting it up. The main problem
seemed to be with its statistics reporting module. The sane way to report statistics is to provide
an API endpoint which can be scraped periodically. This API endpoint should either take the starting
time for statistics or have a configurable time period, which can be passed as a parameter to the
request. Pi-hole had a strange 24 hour pre-configured time window. I was not sure why it was 24
hours or why it is pre-configured.</p>

<p>I was convinced that this was going to be a deal-breaker for me. The only thing I wanted my DNS
server to report was the number of requests that it blocked and the number of requests that it
forwarded to the upstream DNS server. This value <em>could</em> be wrangled out of Pi-hole and I figured
out how to do it. I had to dive deep into Pi-hole’s C code. There isn’t that much of it and I was
able to read it all over a few hours. I had to make <a href="https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aicyflame+is%3Aclosed">2 pull requests</a> to use the existing
configuration variables. These configuration variables were not respected by the application code; a
bad sign for a well-maintained codebase.</p>

<p>With these patches, I had managed to get the statistics that I wanted. Perhaps, I should have
stopped here.</p>

<p>However, the more I thought about <strong>what</strong> Pi-hole was really doing, I realized that its only reason
for existence was statistics collection. Indeed, the whole repository was a large wrapper around
<a href="https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound">Unbound, a full-featured DNS resolver.</a> All Pi-hole did was maintain a few counters which it
incremented based on the requests that it received/blocked. The statistics that it collected were
supposed to be displayed on a GUI dashboard. This dashboard is the reason for the mysterious “24
hour” value above. The code for these counters was not stellar either: There were many global
variables and there seemed to be very little of the neat dependency injection that I am used to.</p>

<p>I <strong>did not</strong> like this design. A blocklist-enabled DNS server should do one thing and one thing
well<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>: Serve DNS requests and block the ones that the user does not want to serve. To plaster a
GUI onto this server and change the code inside to fit it to the needs of the GUI is a bad idea, in
my opinion. If users want a GUI, then they should use the statistics that are reported by the DNS
server and make their own GUI. At the very least, the GUI should be an optional part of the DNS
server and no code or decisions made inside the DNS server should be to please the GUI user.</p>

<p>Pi-hole did not follow any of these principles. Most of the code inside the repository was primarily
to make the GUI better looking. <a href="https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL/pull/1312">One of the patches</a> I made ended up creating a bug for most users of
the Pi-hole GUI because it changed the way that time slots were stored. Instead of storing
statistics for the “24 hours until now” when the server starts, I proposed storing the “24 hours
from the start of the server.” My approach would make sense if the server had to store the
statistics only to report it to the user as a number. If the statistics are part of a GUI, then when
the server starts, the user will see <a href="https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/issues/4459">a jarring empty graph</a> with the current time on the left side of
the horizontal axis, with the future 24 hours with no data.</p>

<p><a href="https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/found-database-entries-in-the-future/55333">This bug</a> which my innocent PR to improve statistics reporting had caused put me over the top. I
decided to change my DNS software because I could not live with this C code which was not designed
in a way that I approved of and had a lot of code to satisfy GUI users, when I knew for a fact that
I was never going to use the GUI bundled with a DNS server.</p>

<h2 id="coredns">CoreDNS</h2>

<p><a href="https://coredns.io/explugins/">CoreDNS</a> is a DNS server written in <a href="https://go.dev/">Golang</a>. It is not a recursive DNS resolver. Indeed, it does not
do anything related to the recursive process required to resole DNS queries. However, it does
everything that is essential before and after this core part of the DNS resolution process. <strong>Most
importantly,</strong> CoreDNS is built with plugins in mind; it provides first-class support for preexisting
plugins as well as plugins written by the user.</p>

<p>Another advantage to keep in mind is that CoreDNS has excellent built-in support for metrics
collection. It is designed to be run inside environments like Kubernetes, where metrics collection
is <strong>not</strong> an afterthought. Specifically, CoreDNS integrates with the popular monitoring server
Prometheus. More on this later.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://coredns.io/manual/plugins/#writing-plugins">plugin API</a> is intuitive. Every DNS request passes through a series of plugins. By controlling
the order in which these plugins operate, it is possible to change the input or the output of these
DNS requests. And any plugin can return a response to the user. All the heavy-lifting required to
keep track of plugins, integrate with each plugin and call them at the appropriate time, identify
whether the plugin is going to respond or simply fall through to the next plugin is done by
CoreDNS. Plugin writers have to care about a single function: This function receives a DNS request
as input, and the plugin writer’s responsibility is to either set a response to this request or to
return an error code indicating that the request should not be passed to the next plugin in the
plugin chain.</p>

<p>Another (incidental) advantage is that I have been using Golang at work for the past 4 years. My
familiarity with the programming language is quite high and I was happy to write and maintain a
CoreDNS plugin. I hoped to learn more about the nitty-grity of DNS implementations, and common
pitfalls that one might fall into along the way.</p>

<p>So, over 2 days, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/icyflame/blocker">CoreDNS plugin</a> to block domains based on a file and <a href="https://github.com/icyflame/pihole-on-raspberrypi/compare/13ed35e71d9cd6159a148fea164f45ec70878995...851cf76e0c413180e866c8ad6f20f193ede7ab68">Ansible configuration</a>
to deploy this plugin alongwith the main CoreDNS application to my Raspberry Pi. The process of
writing the plugin was good. I started with the <a href="https://github.com/coredns/example">coredns/example</a> plugin provided by CoreDNS’
authors. This plugin shows other plugin writers what to think about and how to architect their
plugin. After a few hours of understanding how plugins really worked, I was able to get a working
prototype with a hardcoded list of domains. Switching out the hardcoded source of domains with a
file on the local file store was easy. The most confusing part of the process was understanding
where the order of plugin execution was defined. I understood this process after reading the
excellent blog post from CoreDNS’ authors: <a href="https://coredns.io/2017/06/08/how-queries-are-processed-in-coredns/">How Queries are Processed in CoreDNS</a>.</p>

<h2 id="other-options">Other Options</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS">AdGuardDNS</a> is the closest alternative to what I built. The DNS server is a fork of CoreDNS and it
uses a bunch of plugins built and maintained by AdGuard. I don’t have a good reason for not using
this. One of my friends uses this on their Raspberry Pi and they recommended it to me. I looked into
it and decided not to use it mostly on a whim: <a href="https://adguard-dns.io/en/welcome.html">AdGuard</a> is a business that sells an AdBlocker and VPN
software.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> The DNS server is a part of their offerings. While the DNS server is open source
right now, there is some discussion about how future features might not be added to their open
source offering, prioritizing the paid alternative instead.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We use AdGuard DNS functionality as a part of other AdGuard software, most of which are distributed
on a pay-to-use basis. We might also develop a paid version of AdGuard DNS based on the current one,
more advanced and with more features.

</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/execjosh/mydns">My coworker @execjosh’s mydns</a> is another blocklist-enabled DNS server. It has a lot of logic which
was not a part of my CoreDNS plugin because all the request handling was outsourced to DNS. I used
mydns as a reference for implementing the tricky parts of DNS: Setting the reply and understanding
more about DNS question types/classes.</p>

<h1 id="improved-metrics-collection">Improved Metrics Collection</h1>

<p>So, did my monitoring problem get solved? Yes. <em>Bonus:</em> I did not have to write any code to solve
it.</p>

<p>CoreDNS comes with a <a href="https://coredns.io/plugins/metrics/">metrics</a> plugin. This plugin reports metrics in the <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/">Prometheus</a> format. Having
worked with Prometheus servers inside Kubernetes for the past few years, I am familiar with this
format and I marvel at its simplicity.</p>

<p>Getting the number of blocked and forwarded requests from a Prometheus-compliant metrics endpoint is
<em>very very simple.</em></p>

<p>Using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plugin=</code> part of this output, I can see that 5191 DNS requests were blocked by the
server. 218,955 DNS requests were forwarded to the upstream DNS server (an Unbound instance running
on the same Raspberry Pi.) Forwarded requests faced some errors like “Non-Existent Domain”
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NXDOMAIN</code>) or “Server Failure” (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SERVFAIL</code>).</p>

<p>If I were to run Prometheus on the Raspberry Pi, I would be able to collect these metrics easily and
use Grafana to visualize them. However, I don’t think that I will be doing that. The Raspberry Pi
uses flash memory and is severely limited in terms of disk read/write throughput. The DNS server
itself will rarely read from disk; it needs to read the blocklist file from disk periodically. I am
interested in only one metric from the CoreDNS server, so I believe that I will continue to use an
external monitoring tool such as <a href="https://en.mackerel.io/">Mackerel</a> or a local <a href="https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/tut/rrdtutorial.en.html">Round Robin Database</a>, which is more typical for
networking infrastructure.</p>
