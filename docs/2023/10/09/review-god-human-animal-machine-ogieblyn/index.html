  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>

<p>I wanted to read a book which would delve into the philosophical underpinnings of the ongoing AI
hype: <strong>What was the root of the idea that humans, with all their confusions and complexities, can
ever be replaced by computers?</strong> O’Gieblyn’s column in the Wired magazine, <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/cloud-support/">Dear Cloud Support</a>,
is my favorite part of the magazine. Her writing is lucid and her references come from far and
wide. I was not really prepared for the philosophical depth that is on display in this book:
O’Gieblyn goes to the very beginning of the world and starts with the earliest philosophers (Plato,
Aristotle) and ushers the reader through a series of “frames of mind.” She is not averse to religion
or science; nor is she biased to any particular philosopher or their ideas; quoting from a huge
variety of sources throughout the book to show the ways in which thinking has evolved. Her religious
upbringing and her current vocation as a technology writer feature heavily throughout the
book. After reading this book, I have a clear idea of where the foundation of the hype lies and how
it has <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/25/1031432/what-is-mind-brain-body-connection/">gotten</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/8q854v/elon-musk-simulated-universe-hypothesis">this</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_Algorithm">bad</a>.</p>

<h1 id="history-of-ideas">History of Ideas</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ideas do not just come out of nowhere; they are genetic, geographical.</p>

  <p>– p.133</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The concept that acts as the overture for this book is the Cartesian Partition: Descartes’ claim
that the body and the soul were separate, that the body was machine-like, whereas the soul was
responsible for “human characteristics,” symbolized by the internal experience, of a
person. Descartes did not say much about the soul, or why it was supposed to be responsible for this
internal experience. We can interpret this as his desire to analyze what he could and set aside what
was intractable. Descartes’ aim with the partition between mind and body was to refute the leading
theory of the time, Aristotle’s teleology, a doctrine which claims that ends are immanent in nature
(i.e. vitalism.)</p>

<p>Aristotle’s teleology enchants the world with vitality and “ends” which are inherent to the
object. (A stone falls to the ground because it is the nature of a stone to seek the center of the
Earth, and so on.) Descartes’ cold partition of ends from the interior position that they occupied
<strong>disenchanted</strong> the world, and made it susceptible to analysis. While the “soul” side of Descartes’
partition remained intractable, it was still possible to analyze the “body” side of the
partition. This gives rise to modern science: Newtonian physics, computers, and information theory,
which holds that information is capable of existing alone without any physical form at all.</p>

<p>From here, the threads of thought get quite entangled. First, on the “soul” side of the partition,
there were attempts to resolve the hard problem of consciousness. There was Conway’s Panpsychism,
that consciousness is everywhere and not very unique to humans at all. Through Leibniz, this
philosophy undergoes a transformation and takes the mathematical form of the <strong>Integrated Information
Theory (IIT)</strong> proposed by Goff and Tononi. The IIT proposes that consciousness is the result of a
physical system that has a high degree of integration. The similarities between IIT and Panpsychism
were not missed, because using IIT it is possible to prove that a small system of inactive logical
gates is conscious, even though that makes no sense. Here we sense a vulnerability which is now
being exploited by the peddlers of hype: <strong>No one is quite able to define what consciousness is or
what it enables or how to even identify it.</strong> IIT remains widely contested and there is no agreement
about whether it is the “theory of everything of consciousness.”</p>

<p>On the “mind” side of the partition, things seem to be going swimmingly. From Newtonian physics, we
get many useful tools, the steam engine and computers being major among them. Newtonian physics’
focus on things (unsurprisingly) gives rise to <strong>Materialism</strong>, the idea that matter is the
fundamental substance in nature and that everything springs from it. This was an idea that the
German philosopher Hegel was affected by. Marx and Engels began their theory of human history mainly
as a critique of materialism, ending up with a powerful criticism of Capitalism itself. Though, that
is a topic for another time. Modern materialism is also the root for other things such as
secularism, and alienation induced by modern economic systems.</p>

<p>The rise of materialism gives birth to the (frankly absurd) concept of <strong>Emergence</strong>, the idea that
consciousness will emerge out of a system that is sufficiently similar to the human brain. O’Gieblyn
recounts experiments which test this: Scientists who make robots and wait for them to become
conscious. This was the most interesting part of the book for me. From the point of view of working
with computers, this seemed like an unhinged effort. Imagine a mother board with a basic CPU, main
memory, persistent memory, input devices without <strong>any</strong> software at all; i.e. Not even
firmware. While that is an electrical circuit through which current will flow in some predictable
manner, there is absolutely no way that the motherboard would behave anything like even the most
rudimentary computer. O’Gieblyn sharply points out the contradiction: Emergence comes from the
“body” side of the Cartesian partition, so, to claim that it in-turn gives rise to the “soul” side,
which was intentionally set aside, is not possible.</p>

<p>Materialism spawns other ideas too. <strong>Dualism</strong>, succinctly summarized in the book as the idea that
“mind is software that is running on the brain’s hardware.” This one also assumes that whatever
the mind (or consciousness) is, must be part of the brain’s physical make-up and not something
outside of it at all. Another stray idea is the mechanistic brain, or “machines can be conscious
because consciousness is a mechanistic process, and we will figure out how to replicate it in
machines.”</p>

<p>However, this apparent utopia with material on top does not continue for long: <strong>Challenges appeared</strong>
from everywhere. Kierkegaard’s objection was that subjective experience is the only thing that
matters; and his philosophy, lightly touched on in the book, was almost completely told through the
first person without any affectation of a third-person point of view. Kierkegaard’s descendant is
the famous scientist Bohr, who compared physics and poetry, saying that poetry was the task of
creating images through the severely limited medium of languages, just as physics used languages and
systems of reason to describe the world in an approximate sense; never being able to grasp
everything at once. (Experts say that it is hard to classify Kierkegaard’s philosophy. So, I am not
sure on which side of the partition he put more emphasis. But a rough guess would be that he
preferred the soul far more than the body.)</p>

<p>Returning to the “soul” side of the partition, Panpsychism gives way to <strong>Idealism</strong>: the concept of a
single unified mind which is the universal substrate of every existing mind. There is no Archimedean
point, from which everything can be observed and commented upon. This concept also gives absolute
primacy to subjective experience because that is the only way of describing or learning more about
the world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kierkegaard insisted on the value of subjective truth over objective systems of thought. Fear and
Trembling was in fact written to combat the Hegelian philosophy that was popular at the time, which
attempted to be a kind of theory of everything—a purely objective view of history that was rational
and impersonal.</p>

  <p>– p.133</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="metaphors">Metaphors</h1>

<p>A large part of this book is about metaphors and how they are abused. While we used to say that
computers process information like a brain does, now the metaphor is reversed and we hear sentences
like “I am still processing that information” or “What they said did not compute for me.” This
de-anthropomorphisation of human beings is insidious because it brings people and machines closer
together without clarifying why.</p>

<p>Repeatedly, we see that what was a metaphor suddenly become the way things are talked about.  All of
science is a metaphorical way of explaining how things work to others and ourselves. However, if we
were to believe that science itself was not a metaphor describing how things are but the absolute
system which makes things the way they are, then we go down the slippery slope of granting more
primacy to a system of symbols over reality itself: making claims that information and ideas can
survive on their own forever without any subjective experience.</p>

<h1 id="hype">Hype</h1>

<p>Remember how the words consciousness and intelligence seemed to lack a clear definition? Everyone
was sure about what consciousness looked like (after all, we all have it); but no one was quite sure
how to recognize it in something that was not human, or maybe even inorganic altogether. This is the
vulnerability of the language which the con artists use to get into the news:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Such aspirations necessarily require expanding the definitions of terms that are usually understood
more narrowly. If “intelligence” means abstract thought, then it would be foolish to think that
plants are engaging in it. But if it means merely the ability to solve problems or adapt to a
particular environment, then it’s difficult to say that plants are not capable of intelligence. If
“consciousness” denotes self-awareness in the strongest sense of the word, then nobody would claim
that machines have this capacity. But if consciousness is simply awareness of one’s environment,
or–as has long been the case in artificial intelligence–the ability to behave in ways that appear
deliberate and intentional, then it becomes more difficult to insist on it as a phenomenon that is
unique to humans and other animals.</p>

  <p>– p.109</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is perhaps appropriate to mention the strange case of an engineer thinking that an AI system was
sentient. This engineer explicitly said that they were talking about sentience as a “priest” and not
as a “scientist” It seems hard to interpret that sentence: What is the difference between a priest
and a scientist? Is consciousness for one different from consciousness for the other? This latter
question we can answer with certainty: Yes, consciousness is different for every single person and
profession because there is no clear definition of it anywhere. But what about the former question
about their perceptions of consciousness. If a priest can claim that something is sentient, is that
a higher or lower bar of evidence than a scientist. This is the rub: Traditional modernity has
lionized Science to the point where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S</code> is capitalized; it would be foolish for a modern mind to
claim that the priest’s point of view was more valid than the Scientist’s. But sentience itself is a
concept so far removed from science, that it hardly matters what the profession of the person making
the claims is. This is the point which is always missed: Everyone focused on the credentials of the
person making the claim while the person making the claim was busy saying that they were not using
their credentials to make the claim in the first place. It is clear how this situation can be
quickly monetized for a modern audience that is not interested in the claim or the philosophical
backing of it. They see only the hype itself, and start sharing the story for its own sake; for the
absurdity that it represents, rather than for the truth content of the story.</p>

<p>Arendt was <em>quite concise</em> in expressing this emotion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For Arendt, the problem was not that we kept creating things in our image; it was that we imbued
these artifacts with a kind of transcendent power. Rather than focusing on how to use science and
technology to improve the human condition, we had come to believe that our instruments could connect
us to higher truths.</p>

  <p>– p.239, God, Human, Animal, Machine (O’Gieblyn, Meghan)</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="empiricism-and-science">Empiricism and Science</h1>

<p>Empiricism is the bedrock of modern science. Empiricism is the claim that “more data will eventually
lead to more knowledge.” We can see that more data did <strong>not</strong> lead to more knowledge; if anything,
more data has lead to more buying and selling of goods and services.  Visualizing the data that
almost all technological platforms collect itself requires a bevy of software. Organizations that
collect user data are chaotic enough that companies claiming to help organizations “get their data
in control” have increased rapidly. We frequently talk about <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-warehouse">data warehouses</a> now. The problem is no
longer the lack of data; it is the abundance of it. (There is a truism everyone is tried of
hearing.)</p>

<p>So, a lot of data did not necessarily lead to more knowledge. How about the scientific process? Was
that improved at least? No. Here, O’Gieblyn points out the most basic of insights: The whole point
of Science was to understand how things worked, how mechanisms could be explained; in a sentence, it
was to understand <strong>how</strong> an input (coal) could lead to an output (power). The more data we had about
the input, the output, and the process that happened in between, the more we could improve the
machine. Steam engines are far more efficient now than when they were first invented. A lot of that
was down to more data collection about the various factors which affect efficiency, mathematical
formulations about what leads to more efficiency, and experimental proofs that proved the
formulations right. This cycle is no longer in place anymore.</p>

<p>Every company that dabbles in the “product” business has a “data science” team. Using the most basic
statistical insights (namely, the test for statistical significance), these teams run A/B tests:
assigning users randomly to two different experiences and measuring which one makes them more
money. While the “sober” attitude towards testing is that there is a lot of “user research” which
tells the company what users want, and then the company runs an A/B test to confirm that what users
want is really what makes the company the most amount of money, the real attitude is quite
succinctly summarized in a couple sentences: “Who knows why people do what they do. They do it and
we can measure that with very high fidelity!”</p>

<p>While normal A/B tests are still run by actual engineers and analysts who find insights in some
data, machine learning systems automate this process by setting a mathematical goal in the beginning
and letting the algorithm choose among several variants and find the best variant in a self-feeding
feedback loop. This is the nature of most recommendation algorithms that are used to decide which TV
show should be at the top of a on-demand movie streaming service, and which thumbnail should be used
for the TV show, with the goal to make the user click on the show and watch a few minutes of
it. This problem is exacerbated in opaque industries like <a href="/2023/07/23/review-subprime-attention-crisis-hwang">programmatic advertising</a> where decisions
about which ad should be shown must be made within a fraction of a second.</p>

<h1 id="book-of-job">Book of Job</h1>

<p>The conclusions of this recommendation “algorithm” are to be accepted without questions about or
attempts to understand <strong>how</strong> they were reached. This approach is commonly called science, but as
O’Gieblyn neatly points out, is indistinguishable from the concept of an omniscient God. At the
beginning of the Protestant revolution, Calvin and Luther were priests who said that God was
radically other than human and it was futile to try to understand why God did what He did. <strong>It was
man’s duty to simply accept what was written in scripture and receive all knowledge as revelation.</strong></p>

<p>The rise of <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/machine-learning-interpretability-vs-explainability/">ML explainability</a> is a sign of the apparent inscrutability of systems which are being
built. However, the system which is used to explain the original system is itself independent of it
and a completely different algorithm which is only building a “narrative” about the decision, rather
than actually “looking inside.” Their inherent nature of being a faceless algorithm gives them a
veneer of neutrality and strong protection against any claims that they are unjust in some humanly
understandable way. The problem starts even before the system starts making decisions
(“inferences”):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, because the training data sets are so large, it’s hard to audit them to check for these
embedded biases. “A methodology that relies on datasets too large to document is therefore
inherently risky,” the researchers conclude. “While documentation allows for potential
accountability, […] undocumented training data perpetuates harm without recourse.”</p>

  <p>– <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/">We read the paper that forced Timnit Gebru out of Google. Here’s what it says. | MIT Technology
Review</a> (<em>Retrieved:</em> <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2023-10-09 Mon 16:09]</span></span>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the system finally starts making predictions, its predictions can change behavior. Systems such
as Predictive Policing (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PredPol</code>) were designed to anticipate the neighborhoods with the most
crime; instead, they ended up reinforcing their sample data and producing the very outcome they
predicted because when the police went to a locality hoping to find crime, they often found it.</p>

<h1 id="before-the-cartesian-partition">Before the Cartesian Partition</h1>

<p>At long last, one is convinced that Descartes’ thought experiment, which lead to the mind-body
partition, gave rise to modern science and modern hype. What came before it though? Here again
O’Gieblyn does not disappoint. She goes into the history of ideas before the partition, through the
lens of other philosophers.</p>

<p>Plato’s philosophical system gave primacy to ideas and forms. The World of Forms was always
present and never changing; it was only in that world that the perfect form of an object
existed. There was a separate World of Matter where these objects existed, and they had a
part of the characteristics of the perfect form but they could never hope to be completely identical
to the perfect form which was unattainable. So, in Plato’s thinking, these “Universals” were
characteristics which were always present, always certain, and most importantly, “common” or
“generic.” These universals did not need to be proved.</p>

<p>The Loss of Universals came about in the Late Middle Ages (late 14th century), when suggestions
began that there was nothing universal or common about ideas at all, and that it was just the names
that we give to commonalities we perceive in objects. This was the Nominalist style of
thinking. Nominalism eventually found its way into the mainstream through Protestantism and
subsequently spawned the disenchantment and the scientific revolution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blumenberg’s thesis, which has since been reiterated by a number of philosophers and historians, is
that nominalism, as it became widespread in Protestant theology, led to the Enlightenment,
disenchantment, and the scientific revolution. The trauma of lost universals created an intolerable
situation, one that reached the point of crisis in the thought experiments of Descartes, who so
mistrusted his own powers of reason that it was not inconceivable, he imagined, that God somehow
deceived him into thinking that a square had four sides or that two plus three equaled five.</p>

  <p>– p.215</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is another path down which we find our work-obsessed culture. Protestant theology encouraged a
work ethic which was powered by the anxiety of not knowing one’s predestination. (The concept of
predestination decreed that one’s destination after death, hell or heaven, has been decided and will
remain unaffected by one’s conduct during life.) Predestination, coupled with the Protestant concept
