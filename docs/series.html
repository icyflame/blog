<h3 id="absurd-customer-service-experiences">Absurd Customer Service: Experiences</h3>

<p><i>
<span class="date">April 30, 2022</span>
to
<span class="date">May 1, 2022</span>
</i></p>

<p>Over a few months in the second half of 2021, I faced some strange customer service
hurdles. They came all at once and took me by surprise. I <em>knew</em> that customer service was
never supposed to be a fun experience; and I was used to some of the normal struggles. But it
had been a long time since I had had to experience it at close quarters, and the new customer
service landscape of automated voice guidance, chatbots, unreplied emails, and non-existent
customer service phone lines left me bewildered. If you have a bad experience with a
representative of a modern business, the best case is now that the company will hear your
story completely and respond to it. What their response is has taken a backseat, as customers
crave for the empathetic act of listening and catharsis through it. This is a 2-part series. In
the 1st part, I recount 3 experiences of absurdity with different companies and different
industries. In the 2nd part, I list some of the suggestions which I think will make customer
service measurably better.</p>

<p>Hazing at IIT Kharagpur is referred to by the euphemism Orientation Program, or simply, O.P. I
recount my experience of O.P. during my time at Nehru Hall in IIT Kharagpur between 2013-2018.</p>

<p>A comparison of the above-the-fold content on the home page of a dozen news websites from
around the world. The comparison is based on objective metrics such as number of articles
shown and subjective metrics such as scores for ease-of-use and the number of distracting
elements on the websites.</p>

<span class="date">January 11, 2021</span>
</i></p>

<p>For some inexplicable reason, around the beginning of this year, I was on the RBI website and
reading the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee’s latest meeting. The minutes were very
interesting and seemed to be drawing on data that was not public. It talked about “high-frequency
data” and “foreign exchange reserves.” I had very little understanding of these things and so, I
went down a rabbithole trying to understand the function of Central Banks, the tools that are at
their disposal and how they deploy them at the right time.</p>

<h3 id="configuring-emacs-7-months-later">Configuring Emacs: 7 months later</h3>

<p><i>
<span class="date">November 15, 2020</span>
to
<span class="date">December 1, 2020</span>
</i></p>

<p>In mid-2020, after nearly 6 years of being a religious Vim user, I switched to Emacs. This
series is my story after using it for 7 months. I tell my story in 3 acts, beginning with
the fundamentals such as package management and powerful packages <strong>not</strong> to install right
at the beginning. The second act looks at configuring keybindings and moving around a bit
more effortlessly. The final act walks the user through a couple of Elisp functions I wrote
to solve some issues which are extremely simple in a Regular expression editor such as Vim
but are non-trivial inside Emacs.</p>

<h3 id="media-and-expectations">Media and Expectations</h3>

<p><i>
<span class="date">July 30, 2018</span>
to
<span class="date">August 17, 2018</span>
</i></p>

<p>After a couple years of vicious complaining about the Indian media, nightly shouting matches
and the absurd topics that were chosen for each debate, I read Rosling’s Factfulness. Rosling
points out that the news is “not very useful for understanding the world.” This series is
about how the media will serve the interests of the advertiser and why news channels on
YouTube will probably be better at delivering news. (This series is from 2018. Looking back in
2021, I realize that I trusted in data too much and believed that getting the <em>right</em>
statistic would help me understand and explain the world to others.)</p>
