        <p>I have heard a lot about <a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto">prezto</a>. People who work with me use it and we got
into this recent discussion about how slow a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> request inside your zshrc
makes your shell. Strangely enough, I hadn’t noticed that it made the shell slow
at all. In fact, I was saying that it didn’t make it any slower than without it.
I removed it from my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zshrc</code> and checked it and indeed, it didn’t make my shell
any slower.</p>

<p>A few days went by; I was thinking about this when I was next thinking about why
I hadn’t noticed this clear increase in the time. So, I looked at the time my
shell took to start up again. It was … interesting: <strong>6 seconds</strong>.</p>

<p>YUP. 6 seconds on a machine with an SSD, 16 GB of RAM and an i7 processor. So,
what is the problem here?</p>

        <p><em>This post does not have spoilers about True Detective Season 1</em></p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2356777/episodes?season=3">Season 3</a> started recently, I found myself thinking about what exactly
it was about True Detective season 1 that I liked so much. This post is a look
into what’s great about that season.</p>

<h3 id="the-plot">The Plot</h3>

<p>A murder mystery in Louisiana that is being investigated by two <em>very</em> different
detectives: Rust and Marty. Marty is every man’s man; he has a family, two
daughters and some mistakes in his character. He mingles with people well and
has a good rapport with the people he works with.</p>

        <p>Happy New Year! Let’s jump right in!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>This American Life</strong> - <strong>The Walls</strong> - <strong>5/5</strong></p>

    <p>A fascinating episode! This American Life is one of those podcasts that I
  listen to rarely, but every time I do I end up with an episode that is
  absolute gold! This episode came out at the top of the “Trump shut down the
  government for a wall” news story and debates some of the amazing walls
  around the world. The conclusion is simple: <em>Walls make us feel safe</em>,
  irrespective of how big they are, whether there’s another wall on the other
  side of the wall on <em>our</em> side, whether it actually even exists or has been
  conjured out of nowhere just to pacify us. This episode also follows the
  story of a man who has lived all his life with a wall in his home country; A
  wall that has made his relatives strangers to him and how he reconciles with
  that. <em>Once a wall is built, it becomes a fact of life and affects the way
  life is lived around it</em> When put like that, we really see how much power
  walls have! An absolutely amazing episode!</p>

        <p><em>Note:</em> This post is very delayed (it should have been out on December 27th); It
was stored as a note on my iPhone with a set of links. I have added a short
summary of each podcast and why I liked like it other posts in this series.
Let’s dive in!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Daily</strong> - <strong>Ethics of Genetically Editing Babies</strong></p>

    <p>This is related to the story where a Chinese scientist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/health/gene-editing-babies-china.html">claimed</a> to have
  created / helped make (what even is the right word?) the world’s first
  genetically edited babies. After discussing this case and talking about what
  actually happened and why it might be suspect, the guest on this show goes
  on to describe why one or two reckless scientists like this person can
  actually end up forcing countries around the world to heavily regulate or
  even completely stop the research into this field because they don’t trust
  the scientists anymore. I think that that was a very succinct explanation of
  why things like this are bad, while also keeping in mind that more and more
  of the things that we consider impossible in our lifetimes will become
  possible and someone will do them. And our tolerance of innovation might
  very well be defined by our acceptance or rejection of these ground breaking
  events.</p>

        <p>This post might be about 20 days late, but it sure is packed with some of the
best stuff that I heard in the last month. There’s a lot of foreign policy and
politics related stuff this month.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Impact</strong> - <strong>Plane Crash hospitals vs. Car Crash hospitals</strong> <strong>5/5</strong></p>

    <p>This episode is about how every single plane crash automatically starts an
  investigation. The investigation eventually leads to a diagnosis of what
  went wrong.  Using this diagnosis, the check lists are updated, new
  processes are introduced to ensure that the chances of the same problem
  causing another accident goes down signficantly. Whereas, car crashes are
  rampant and happen every single day. No investigations are done, and it
  doesn’t seem like the situation is improving. <strong>What happens when a hospital
  applies the Plane crash principal to solve a problem that they realize is
  too big?</strong> It has a lot of subtle points about authority, ego, and how a
  change in a process, inside any institution, can’t be overnight even if it
  has provably better results.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The only series on this blog is still the <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/tag/#100daysofwriting">100 days of writing</a> I did
last year. I <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/pune-diaries/art/gallery/sheil/2018/07/26/pune-diaries-1/">keep</a> <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/monthly/music/update/2017/10/07/music-update-august-2017/">starting</a> series and never writing the second post in
that series. I really do hope this one is different. Specially because I want to
keep track of the great podcasts that I listen to over the years. In fact, just
to ensure that I get this done, I am adding this to my calendar. It’s a monthly
2 day event (from 27th-29th). I am repeating it for the next 1 year, we will see
how I do then.</p>

<p>I have been listening to a lot more podcasts lately (Courtesy: 30 minute
commute to work and random walks around the streets of Tokyo). And I have
actually heard a lot more great content that I can believe! It has just been one
great episode after another. Seriously. I am not even kidding. I started
listening to the serious Ezra Klein Show at a point where I had run out of Daily
(NYT) episodes. The Daily (NYT) has a huge list of episodes that I absolutely
loved! Here are a few episodes that I highly recommend:</p>

I moved to Tokyo in September. I came here in the third week of September and started working at Mercari from the 1st week of October.</p> <p>Mercari is a C2C marketplace (mainly for second hand goods) in Japan. There’s a Mercari product in the US and UK as well. I got the job in IIT Kharagpur’s placements in December 2017. Yes, I have been fairly silent on this blog and everywhere else about the job; primarily because there were a lot of things that needed to all go well for me to actually start working here.

        <p>I read a few excellent (albeit old) articles on advertising recently. A few of them were on <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">The Doc Searls Weblog</a>. My main take away from these articles was that offline advertising is not <em>ineffective</em> because an ad run on TV is seen by all sorts of people and is targeted at a cross section of the population; In fact, it is <em>very effective</em> because of that very property.</p> <p>I recently made a cross-country move (more on this in a later post). I wanted to select a phone contract in the new country. There were several companies and it was all very confusing. I had two references: a contract that my company’s HR people recommended and companies that I...
