  <p>When Facebook came on the scene, the most attractive features on the platform for me were photo
albums and life events. These two features in combination gave the user the ability to build a
timeline of their life. Every trip that you go on, place that you visit, and dinner that you eat
<em>can</em> be documented for the present and archived for the future. The photos and events were arranged
as milestones that the user <em>chose</em> to retain when they told their story.  The digitized nature of
this data enabled the creation of works that were out of reach for the ordinary scrapbooker or the
amateur video editor: The <a href="https://youtu.be/8WIdJs0v3LM">personalized Facebook “Lookback” videos</a>, which were generated for
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/4/5376396/facebook-look-back-video-lets-you-relive-the-last-ten-years-of-your-online-life">Facebook’s 10th anniversary</a>, were the biggest “proof-of-concept” of a world which was digitizing at
a fast pace. I feel that Facebook was at “peak utility” back then. <em>Nostalgia</em> was the currency that
the platform traded in effortlessly. Product managers at Facebook intuitively understood the value
that they were creating in their users’ lives. Looking at the Lookback video is <strong>not</strong> like looking
back at photo albums from a decade ago because in the latter experience there is no
curation. However, Facebook’s usage is on the decline. Platforms that focus on creating <em>Anxiety</em> in
their users’ minds are on the rise. Did something fundamental change?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I <em>really liked</em> my personalized Lookback video released in 2014 and I must have watched it at least
a dozen times, noticing new details every time I re-watched it. Facebook used technology to build
something that could not have been built without it; they produced something for everyone which was,
until then, out of reach for amateurs. I can say this without any qualification: Facebook <strong>was</strong> at
its peak utility at that point in time. I wonder if I would have continued to use Facebook if it had
stood out as the only platform that focused on nostalgia, among a gaggle of platforms that focused
on making people anxious by showing them what everyone was else doing <em>right now</em>; a wave of
products that ostensibly began with Snapchat Stories.</p>

<p>The most popular platforms of today are good at sharing “the current moment.” They deal in the
currency of <em>Anxiety.</em> They force their users to share the present, which fuels an urgent need to do
<em>something interesting.</em> Why did social media become a place where archiving lost its value and
sharing the present with a large audience was the primary objective?</p>

<p>The popular platforms of this new era are Tik Tok, Instagram, and Snapchat. Tik Tok is the only
platform that tries to get its users to produce content that is widely shared and holds for a
relatively long period of time<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Instagram and Snapchat are completely invested in the “right
now.” Their investment in the “now” is different from the historical goals of Facebook. On Facebook,
you share what’s happening now for the benefit of the future. When you create a Life Event on
Facebook, that event stays there forever, just as the event changes you, the event changes your
Facebook timeline. When you add a photo to your Instagram Story, it disappears in 24 hours. Nothing
you do on these platforms has any lasting impact anymore. Archiving has become a thing of the
past. Even in the cases where content <em>goes viral,</em> the phenomenon has a dizzyingly short
lifespans<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>There is no question about the currency that is valued higher in capitalism. <em>Nostalgia</em> has its
place in society, but <em>Anxiety</em> is where the money is at. When things are going to disappear in 24
hours, you probably want to consume them right away, procrastinating for a few hours. A newspaper
that publishes every 10 minutes will have significantly higher turnover than one that publishes
every day, as long as people are interested in the content and the content producers can work at
that rate. With everyone signing up to produce and consume content, both those conditions are met in
the “push notification newspaper” world.</p>

<p><em>Anxiety</em> (in my opinion) is the manifestation of scarcity that is sensed in a system. There are
limited seats in a movie theater and if you really want to watch a movie, watch it as soon as you
can and book the ticket as soon as they are available. Artificial scarcity marketing techniques work
well for brick-and-mortar businesses like Apple (which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef_BznBwktw">used to have cash sales</a>) and even publishing
houses that used to release books that people would wait for several hours to get their hands
on. (Rowling’s Harry Potter series comes to mind.) “Don’t put things off because you might lose the
opportunity to <em>ever</em> experience them.” This insight into the effect that enforcing scarcity would
have on their users’ minds was the driving principle behind the product that started this modern
wave of platforms: Snapchat Stories.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Archiving the past has been delegated to other platforms like Google Photos and Apple’s
iCloud. These services also attempt to create artsy videos using your pictures, grouping them by
location and the people that you are with. The data that Google or Apple have about your pictures is
an insignificant subset of the data that Facebook had about the same pictures.  These auto-generated
videos can’t be compared to what Facebook created.</p>

<p>Facebook had the ability to figure out what was important to <strong>you</strong>. Facebook <em>knew</em> about your most
liked post. The more life-changing your announcement, the more people are going to engage with it;
the more people will congratulate you, and so on<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Apple and Google have no idea about the
importance of any life event or even about the presence of a life event behind a set of pictures,
that were taken in close spacial or temporal proximity. The effects of this ignorance are clear when
one sees iCloud’s attempts to build videos. <strong>Every video looks the same.</strong> They are templates
rendered with different photos. There’s no <strong>personalization.</strong> There’s no understanding of how
important a set of pictures was <strong>to the user.</strong> Even the name of the auto-generated video is just an
amalgamation of the month that pictures were taken in and the places where the pictures were taken.</p>

<p>Will the value of archiving rise again? After all, the Sepia tone filter is a mainstay on most
Camera applications today and people still post old pictures to Instagram Stories on Mothers’
Day.</p>

<p>I don’t think archiving will make a significant comeback. Human nature has not changed. I will not
argue that point.</p>

<p>But the thought process behind nostalgia has changed as people understood how to use the online
tools that were at their disposal. Online tools prefer things that can be safely publicized. The
ability to share content is key for the creator of <em>successful</em><sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> online content. Private
experiences have their own space, but those spaces are an afterthought in modern
platforms. <strong>Experiences that create Nostalgia are private. Experiences that create Anxiety <em>can</em> be
publicized.</strong> A Lookback video is interesting to the subject and the handful of people who are
closest to them. A Snapchat highlight about their recent trip to Europe is mildly interesting to
almost everyone.</p>

<p>A new platform might come around which tries to work with nostalgia and convince its users that
<em>their</em> feelings about the past are more important than <em>others’ admiration</em> of the
present. Personally, I am pessimistic about the return of nostalgia because the success of modern
platforms has convinced me that <strong>we</strong> continue to disregard Seneca’s advice from over 2000 years ago.</p>
