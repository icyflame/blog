        <p>For the last 5 years, I lived in Kharagpur, West Bengal. It is a town, no more no less. There’s nothing to expect there, and it lives up to that expectation. A movie theater started flourishing in my last year there. Apart from that, there was <em>nothing to do</em> there.</p> <p>After those 5 years, and even in between during Summer and Winter vacations, I was in various cities: Chennai, Bangalore, Coimbatore briefly. But I never <em>did</em> anything that I was unhappy about being unable to do when I was in Kharagpur.</p> <p>Now, I am in Pune until the first week of September. I am in the training period for a job, and my weekdays are not free in any sense...

        <p><strong>Primer:</strong> Donna Tartt is a 53-year old writer from Mississippi. She has written only three novels and she released them in 1992, 2002 and 2013. Each of those novels is nearly 600 pages long. She rarely gives any interviews.</p> <hr /> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/1013102545999310848"><img src="/public/img/2018-07-01-twitter.png" alt="twitter-screenshot" /></a></p> <p>This was one of my major goals for this summer. I had already read The Secret History by Tartt and after reading that book, I seriously believed that she was an author unlike anyone I had ever read. Some thoughts from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1470325810">right after</a> I finished the book:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>An attrocious act, on the face of it, but surprisingly towards the end, I was empathising with their situation, and although, I...

        <p>One fine Monday evening, I was absent mindedly scrolling through Twitter, which was when I came across this tweet from TRAI, the Telecom Regulator in India:</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Stakeholders sharing their views on Landing Page Issues in Open House Discussion on Consultation Paper on &#39;Issues related to placement of TV channel on landing page&#39; at TRAI HQ, New Delhi <a href="https://twitter.com/TRAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TRAI</a> <a href="https://t.co/6ZQPKMkitk">pic.twitter.com/6ZQPKMkitk</a></p>&mdash; TRAI (@TRAI) <a href="https://twitter.com/TRAI/status/1001050391495163904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>Understandably, I was confused. Mainly, I wasn’t sure this topic needed such a formal open house discussion which no doubt made executives from the stakeholder companies fly to Delhi to sit in and make sure their voices were heard. So, I retweeted this and forgot...

        <p>Back in August 2017, I hadn’t yet dipped my feet into OpenSSL’s command line yet. That’s when I ended up finding out about a set of OpenSSL commands that have a solution for most cryptography related requirements. Secondly, it’s a great way to just explore and find out about new technologies. So, here’s a list of commands that absolutely floored me when I first found out about them:</p> <h2 id="1-openssl-x509">1. openssl x509</h2> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>openssl x509 <span class="nt">-in</span> ~/Downloads/twittercom.crt <span class="nt">-text</span> | less </code></pre></div></div> <p>This command inspects x509 certificates from the internet. Firefox has a great certificate inspector, but for every field, you have to go and highlight it and then the value for that field...

After a month and a half without a post, I don’t even think I can make a proper excuse. But I am done with college, and I am going to be free till the second week of July and there will be regular posts until then. (I am thinking twice a week. Forced-sort, so that I don’t have the choice to not write. Kind of like a short re-run of 100 days of writing. Enough blabbering, on to the post now)</p> <p>Anyone who has been a student in India for more than 10 years will...

And everything in it is outfitted exactly as he likes it. He never searches for things in his studio, he just <strong>gets them</strong>.</p> <p><em>Hang on, this is not just a rave about Casey Neistat’s studio</em></p> <p>I have been thinking about what the equivalent of a studio would be for a programmer.

        <p>There is this approach to consuming information online. I don’t know what it is called or who came up with it. The approach is to look at a topic, write down the solid questions you would like to answer about the topic, consume the material about this topic that’s in front of you and after you are done, answer the questions that you had started out with. With several blogs (esp Slate Star Codex), this approach has helped me a lot. Especially because it gives me an idea about what I would like to know, what my presumptions / beliefs about the questions are <em>before</em> I read the article and am influenced by the author’s presumptions and beliefs.</p> <p><a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/19/technological-unemployment-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/">Technological...
