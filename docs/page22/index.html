        <p>Today, we had a Metakgp meetup to meet all the candidates in our <a href="https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Metakgp:Governance/Election_March_2017">upcoming maintainer election</a>. So, to be clear, we are <em>not</em> looking for a maintainer for one of our projects, rather we are looking for a maintainer for Metakgp. Their roles are diverse but would include day-to-day management, resolving conflicts between members, making the <em>right</em> decisions with inputs from everyone in the community and pushing the community towards a consensus if the community can’t find it on it’s own, and finally fascilitating an environment where new people would feel comfortable joining and contributing. This <a href="https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Metakgp:Governance#Role_of_maintainers">role</a> is much better described at the <a href="https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Metakgp:Governance">Metakgp:Governance</a> wiki page.</p> <p>We have <em>a lot</em> of candidates this year. And the process...

        <p>I have made very very less progress with Handmaid’s tale. It’s not that the book is not good, it is Good, but it’s confusing and highly taxing to read. The story keeps shifting into either a flashback, or an abstract comparison with something from Offred’s previous life, and it gets rather hard to keep track if you are travelling or something. I hope to make a lot more progress in the next few hours. I am going to install Abaqus (Ansys is installed, but Abaqus apparently is something that people are more familiar with), so that should give me a few hours of solid reading.</p> <p>This post was again missed, I keep thinking about whether I should start using <a...

        <p>I don’t really know what to write about. It’s been about 15 minutes since I opened this file and edited the header. No idea has really occurred to me, yet.</p> <p>The next issue on Github that I am going to target is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subjects.json</code> inconsistency that is bound to happen between all Metakgp repositories.</p> <p>Basically, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subjects.json</code> is meant to be a JSON file that maps subject courses offered in IIT Kharagpur to the name of the subject. Right now, there’s a JSON file that’s used. I can’t be sure that the same version of the file is used in these projects: <a href="https://github.com/metakgp/mfqp-source">mfqp-source</a>, <a href="https://github.com/metakgp/gyft">gyft</a>.

        <p>ARGH! I missed yesterday. It wasn’t even too tiring a day or anything, anyway, I am going to make the best of this. I am about 8 hours later than when the usual post should have been.</p> <p>I have not been writing a lot of code, and I hadn’t submitted a pull request in almost 20 days! <em>That’s unacceptable, Jimmy, UNACCEPTABLE.</em></p> <p><img src="/public/img/day-27-1.png" alt="img" /></p> <p>I decided to remedy that situation today. Gyft is a set of python scripts which lets you login into your IIT Kharagpur ERP account, get your timetable for the semester from there. Before my patch, the only option was to put this timetable into your Google Calendar. You generate a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">client_secret</code> file and...

I missed one day in between till now, and that was not even the day I was <em>most tired</em> on. In fact, the days that I was most tired on, turned out to be the challenging ones when I struggled to write the 500 words and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code>.</p> <p>I would like to talk a little bit about the encrypted FS setup that I have got going on, in...

        <p>I didn’t watch Revenant, actually. In the day 21 post, I said I would watch it, but I couldn’t watch it. I started watching it, but they weren’t getting to the point. I had a similar reaction to Avatar when I saw it for the first time, I loved it afterwards. So, I will try again some time soon.</p> <p>I started the day with this tweet which I thought indicated the end of my troubles with the left click on the mouse not working with a new Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installation on a Dell laptop. It was not, I faced the problem again about 12 hours after the tweet, and I tried this but the problem didn’t fix itself. Interestingly,...

He had this to say about it:</p> <blockquote> <p>And then … The final problem was that the generated C code didn’t have proper checking for the pointer that breaks the code. Now this kind of stuff are the biggest problems with C.</p> <p>Secondly, most of the code currently at the core of the system is C. Take anything, finally it will be converted to C, or uses some code that is C.</p> <p>I don’t understand one thing. People keep blaming C for how it manages most stuff. But when any kind new programming languages, structures that people make, they use C at their heart to work. The new things are...
