        <p>In December 2020, I came across several articles about India’s Central Bank, the Reserve Bank of
India, intervening in the open market to maintain excess liquidity of the Indian Rupee in the
market. With my elementary understanding of currencies, I understood that this excess liquidity of
INR in the market, would keep the currency weak against other currencies, and this seemed
undesirable. In this post and <a href="/central-banks/economic-theory/economy/governments/india/2021/01/11/india-central-bank-interventions-goals-2-the-reasoning/">the next one</a>, I will delve into the complicated reasoning behind the
RBI’s choices and their delicate balancing act which seems to be associated with a high but
manageable amount of risk.</p>

        <p>Over the past few days, several countries have approved vaccine candidates for emergency use and
even wider use. In the US and in India, 2 vaccines have been approved. In the UK, both vaccines that
were approved in the US have been approved, along with one that has been approved in India (under a
different brand name). After seeing all these approvals, I wanted to understand what their
comparative merits and demerits were. In particular, I wanted to understand the size of their
clinical trials, the confidence each had in their efficacy numbers and their safety profiles. To
this end, I read the “Primary results” research papers for all 4 vaccines. This post will try to
compare the headline numbers, and explain some of the similarities between the trials, and the
things that seem to have happened only with a single vaccine.</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> These papers were clearly written with very little medical terminology. I was able to
understand them once I knew what terms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion">Seroconversion</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity">Immunogenicity</a> meant. The papers do
have a considerable amount of graphs and numbers, so parsing them is an important part of reading
them.</p>

We’ve been organizing for over a year, &amp; we’re finally ready to share why.<br /> <br />This morning, we&#39;re announcing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AWU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AWU</a>, the first union open to *all* workers at any Alphabet company.<br /> <br />Every worker deserves a union—including tech workers.<a href="https://t.co/m2Qmjwz32V">https://t.co/m2Qmjwz32V</a></p>&mdash; Alphabet Workers Union (@AlphabetWorkers) <a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1346050124544233473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2021</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Today, there was <a href="http://archive.today/2021.01.05-004554/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html">an article</a> announcing a new workers union for all employees working at Alphabet,
Inc., Google’s parent company, the <a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/">Alphabet Workers Union</a>. The union is constituted by about 400
employees, an extremely small percentage of the total workforce of nearly 250,000 people. The union
dues are 1% of total compensation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We still have discrimination, harassment, &amp; retaliation at Google. Over half our workforce are
TVCs—paid less, w/fewer benefits, for often the exact same work.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>We deserve meaningful control over the projects we work on &amp; the direction of this company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s where it gets interesting: The union is a <span class="underline">minority union</span>. As the union doesn’t have a
majority of all the employees as members, there is no basis for them to walk up to Alphabet’s
management and demand to negotiate a Union contract. Instead, they are going to use their union as a
more abstract entity that will be used for other purposes. The question that came up when I was
discussing this with a few co-workers was whether the social cost of <span class="underline">this particular type of union</span>
is spread out disproportionately between the employer and the union members?</p>

        <p>On Dec 10th 2020, Zeynep Tufekci made <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/vaccines-and-decision-making-with">a public argument</a> for a trial of the single dosage of the
Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines on her mailing list, Insight. When I first read the argument and
it’s basis on the apparent safety and efficacy of just the single dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine, as described in the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">official peer-reviewed paper</a>, I agreed with Tufekci. Her argument is a
solid one and poses the central question: <strong>Is vaccinating 95% of 50% of available doses better than
60-80% of the total available doses?</strong> The answer is equally simple: <strong>No one knows yet</strong>. Some
inferences can be drawn from the data of the 1300 people who didn’t get the second dose in the
original N = 40,000 clinical trial. But this subset of 1300 people is not as random as the original
well-designed trial. Another clinical trial, the advocacy for it in as many public forums as
possible and subsequent funding / trial design seems like the prudent way to go forward, as Tufekci
describes in her post.</p>

<p>On Dec 30th 2020, Tufekci posted philosophy professor,<a href="http://www.matthewnoahsmith.net/">Matthew Noah Smith</a>’s <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/a-counter-argument-against-public">counter</a> to her original
argument on Insight. I read that post today and found it to be particularly weak. This post goes on
to explain why I felt that, and the peculiarities in Smith’s post.</p>

        <p>A few days ago, I started thinking about why I was not spending time writing posts for this blog OR
working on a side project that I have wanted to work on for a while. My conclusion was that I was
not allocating my time properly. This is not original; I didn’t think it was a significant
conclusion at first. As I started working on that, I came across another question that felt like a
pretty good summary of what I was feeling at that point in time:</p>

<p><strong>What is the Most Valuable Resource (MVR) in your life right now?</strong></p>

<p>I started thinking about this off-and-on, and I eventually came to the conclusion that right now, it
is <strong>Time</strong>. Thinking back to my childhood or my time in college, and I realized that my MVR in those
stages of life were different from what it is now. In college, it was <strong>Experience</strong>. In school, it
was <strong>Identity</strong>. This post is an exploration of my thinking on this subject. It is meant to stimulate
readers to think about what their MVR is, how it has changed over the years, and how they might go
about gaining more of their MVR through conscious changes in behavior.</p>

<p>Emacs Lisp is the language that is used to configure Emacs. It is a functional programming language
and looks very similar to the prefix notation that is used when doing simple arithmetic:</p>

<div class="language-elisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">/</span> <span class="mi">2000</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+</span> <span class="mi">34</span> <span class="mf">4.5</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="c1">;; Insert the current time string at point in the active buffer</span>

<p>After figuring out how to install packages, as you start to use the editor more, you run into cases
where the keybindings are inconvenient or don’t exist at all. During this phase, the 3 months
between June and August, I added a lot of keybindings. Most of them were to mimic the functionality
that I had configured with Vim over some time. A lot of them were new keybindings which made sense
only in the Emacs world.</p>

<p>My first commit to <a href="https://github.com/icyflame/.emacs.d">icyflame/.emacs.d</a>, the repository with my Emacs configuration, was in April this
year (7 months ago). Now, I have reached a point at which I have cleaned up my configuration enough
to feel okay about making it open source. In this post and the two posts after this one, I will go
over some of the most important steps in my configuration’s evolution from scratch to it’s current
form.</p>

<h1 id="context">Context</h1>

<p>I started my configuration from scratch with a vanilla Emacs installation. This is a personal
preference; there are several configurations out there which allow people to start from a
opinionated configuration which they can understand and tweak to their needs. (There are even Emacs
distributions like <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a> which have a lot of the plugins which I configured manually already
installed!)</p>

        <p>I talked about some of the <a href="/emacs/editors/tools/2020/07/08/vim-and-emacs/">problems with Markdown</a> that I was facing in my daily note-taking at work
and at home. I had been looking for a replacement for my note taking system since early this
year. Org mode seemed like a good candidate and a few people recommended it to me, so I started
using it.</p>

<p>Now, I have used Org mode for about 6 months at work and at home. In my personal life, I managed the
move to a new apartment and switching to a new mobile phone provider entirely using a single
sub-tree in my notes file. At work, I have used Org for a few months now as I worked on a variety of
Search and SRE tasks; a lot of them included huge files and ad-hoc Perl scripts which were written
almost entirely within Org and are still stored only inside Org. This post is about my experience
with Org mode and a list of the things that I believe are the strengths and weaknesses of this
markup language.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I have written about <a href="https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/tag/#gnucash">GnuCash</a> a few times before. I have been using GnuCash version 2.6 for
nearly 2 years now. A lot of the features that were added after this version weren’t really useful
for my use-case, so I never upgraded. Also, the binary that is distributed through the Ubuntu App
store / apt-get repositories is v2.6. Versions after that were not published to the aptitude
repositories, for some reason. (A lot of software packages do this)</p>

<p>Recently, I ran into a very strange <a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=797926">bug</a>. I wanted to report this bug to the GnuCash team and
get their feedback on if this was something that they had seen before. To avoid reporting a bug on
an old version which was no longer being supported actively, I got the latest version of the GnuCash
code and started a long, uphill battle to build it locally! This post is a summary of that
experience.</p>

<p>For those who are looking to run the latest version of GnuCash inside Docker, you can get this
<a href="https://github.com/icyflame/dockerfiles/blob/master/gnucash/Dockerfile#L1-L9">Dockerfile</a> and build the Docker image. The command to run it on an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS host is
given at the top of the Dockerfile.</p>
