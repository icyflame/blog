        <p>Well, Gmail 5.0, was probably the one release of Gmail, which I was most eager for. Before this, almost always, the updates have been merely “behind the scenes”. Slight bug-fixes, fixing crashes etc. But this was different, this brought on a totally new and fresh material design template to the one app on Android which I used the most!</p> <p>For the past few days, there have been many updates for the Google apps on my Nexus 7, and all of them have been updated with the Material Design guidelines, and now, Google+ actually makes sense. I have been using it often to check out articles and stuff shared by Coursera, and other such firms, but basically, I am kinda hooked...

        <p>And then, I decided that my beloved Nexus 7 (2012 version, the device is called “grouper” for some mysterious reason!), had remained with stock Android for too long, and that it needed to go out there and explore the world of flashing custom ROMs, and experiencing other OSs. So, I opened up the Ubuntu for Devices installation guide.</p> <p>The webpage was familiar, I had been there before a lot of times, almost always, with the intention of flashing Ubuntu onto my Tablet, but always, coming up with some excuse to not do so. This time I was determined! I had backed up everything using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">adb</code> command line utility from my Ubuntu 12.04 laptop, and anyway, it wasn’t...

        <p>So, after my last post, I came back to campus, this Monday! And once I came back to the campus, I was behind a proxy again. This ensures that there is no easy way (as for now, I don’t know any way at all) to SSH with servers outside. So, Git SSH, Heroku SSH everything’s gone!</p> <p>So, I am pretty convinced that I made the most of my 6 days at home, where there were no proxies, just pure internet access!</p> <p>At home, I had also, configured three basic Ruby Gems, which I am determined to use in all my successive projects and one Gem which was a failure.</p> <p>So, starting with the three that worked perfectly well, they were...

        <p>So, after the previous post, which actually caught the attention of the people at Travis CI, I am back with the next part of the application lifecycle.</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/5162296267884544000"><img src="/public/img/2014-09-29-travis-ci-conversation-screenshot.png" alt="twitter-screenshot" /></a></p> <p><strong>Shipping!</strong> Although, the word is simple, and the process is pretty easy to understand, it was something that I obviously, had never done before, and didn’t have any idea what it meant either. Because, till now, I have worked with PHP and deploying PHP is simply copying the files onto a server that supports PHP hosting (whatever that means!). Rails, though, was a different game, altogether!</p> <p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, seemed to be the platform of choice, on the internet. So, I went through the Heroku Getting started for deploying...

        <p>About a month into this semester, I found out that <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> is actually free for open source projects. And since all of my projects were open source, and I had already seen those great looking <a href="https://travis-ci.org/icyflame/alum-cell-blog-rails"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/icyflame/alum-cell-blog-rails.svg?branch=master" alt="Build Status" /></a> badges on some repositories, I was excited.</p> <p>Building a project was something new for me. Generally, all I really cared about was how it rendered on the screen, but building a projects, and running Unit Tests (which was the single most intimidating thing according to me) was new and something that waited to be explored! So, I set out on the journey to crack Travis CI and get the above badge on the README files of one...

        <p>It’s that time of the Fall semester again. About 70 days ago, we came back and started second year (Yay!). And now we are going back, “The Durga Puja Vacations.”, and unlike last year, (when it was a badly scheduled 5 day holiday), this year it is 5 weekdays, and with the two weekends, preceding it and succeeding it, you learn to put them all together, and get 9 days out of it! The campus is slowly emptying out, those without labs, would mostly have left the campus, ( the three days after mid-semester exams, hardly matter! :P )</p> <p>I am still here. Leaving tomorrow. It would be a 26 hour train journey to Chennai (yeah, new home!).</p> <p>The Mid...

        <p>Four exams, two of which were “Science of Living Systems” and “Environmental Science” (Who thought we would have to study these in college! :/ ). And the other two were Dynamics and Transform Calculus.</p> <p>Although, at the very beginning, I was pretty afraid of Dynamics, (Analysing moving parts always freaked me out!), I turned out to love Dynamics, surprisingly! Transform Calculus, has always been great!</p> <p>But I guess, the emphasis should be on the fact that, these papers were within a span of 72 hours. And in quick succession. Morning Afternoon, + 24 hours and +36 hours. Which was just bad!</p> <p>But somehow, it’s over, and we are up and running again.</p> <p>Right about now, almost everyone started the countdown...

        <p>Often called, the best language to develop web applications, Rails, has pretty much been a stranger to me, much to my disbelief (at not being able to install a simple package on my machine, even after asking so many other people) and unhappiness (I really do wanted to get on board, with the language that was being used in SO many web applications, starting right from GitHub! [ Which is probably the best web application out there! ]).</p> <p>But now I have it installed. Yay!</p> <p>Once I installed Ruby, from source, (because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt-get</code> didn’t work, and I didn’t wanna debug.) Fingers-crossed, I fired up the first command. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rails new blog</code>.</p> <p>I had a lot of ideas...

And he knows what’s going on here. Having recently completed Season 1, and appalled at the fact that Carrie was fired from the CIA, because of something that was true, but just didn’t play out as she had put it, and having seen the second episode of the second season, I believe, that this is Carrie’s redemption.</p> <p>The SD Card, containing the Video that Brody had recorded thinking that he is going to die due to the suicide bomb, is now with Saul.

I wish I had taken the time to set it up sooner.</p> <p>The setup was not really the most painless one that I have ever done, but it was good. One of the major problems which I faced was simply that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post.url</code> was not being calculated properly, because, the function itself returned the URL of the post, but prefixed it with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>,...
