  <p>2019! It was my first full year at work, first full year outside India, the
first time I spent a considerable amount of time learning and conversing in a
foreign language. I looked back on the things I did and experienced in 2019 and
wrote down the ones that stood out.</p>

<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>

<p>I went to Europe for the first time! It was also the first time I travelled
outside India with my parents. We spent about a week in Italy! We went to
Vatican City and stood in the plaza in front of St. Peter’s Basilica. I enjoyed
the food and coffee that is especially in abundance in Italy, the amazing nature
around Lake Como and the clean, crisp mid-August air.  I also realized that most
of the paintings in Rome were about war, strife, hunger and conflict.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I also went snowboarding for the first time. It was a back-breaking experience,
I look forward to going once every year.</p>

<p>I visited Hiroshima and that was a very good trip. It’s a small city and so much
of it is built around the A-Bomb from 74 years ago. It was an essential
experience for me, to see the devastation that the bomb caused, to hear about
the people it affected and to be in the city that I had read about all my life,
without quite internalizing the impact.</p>

<p><strong>Note to self:</strong> Arrive around noon, instead of after 8 pm at the country’s
airport. Bring an empty water bottle and buy 2L bottles from a grocery store.
Set a day aside to go to the various restaurants in whichever city you are
staying in.</p>

<h2 id="books-and-podcasts">Books and Podcasts</h2>

<p>I <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/14601568">did not</a> get to my goal of 25 books in 2019. I did read some very good
books though. The highlights for me were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stranger in a Strange Land (Heinlein)</li>
  <li>Eichmann in Jerusalem (Arendt)</li>
  <li>The Box (Levinson)</li>
  <li>The Lever of Riches (Mokyr)</li>
</ul>

<p>I realized that I really like non-fiction written by economists. So, I am going
to be reading more of that in the coming years.</p>

<p>On the podcast front, I <em>really</em> got into podcasts this year! I heard The Daily
everyday, the whole year and there were some amazing episodes and series.
Looking through the list of episodes on PocketCasts, I see some starred
episodes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Jungle Prince series</strong> - November</li>
  <li><strong>The Origins of Boeing’s 737 Max Crisis</strong> - July - I heard this right before
getting on a 14 hour flight to Munich. The management style’s direct impact on
the factory floor was surprising when you hear about it from someone in middle
management.</li>
  <li><strong>The President and the Publisher</strong> - February - “He just wanted his home
town’s newspaper to do a good story about him” - Maybe it was an act, maybe it
was real. Either way, the vulnerability and the detail with which this episode
detailed Trump’s interview with NYT’s publisher and journalists was good.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>

<p><img src="/public/img/2019-spotify-playlists.png" alt="spotify" /></p>

<p>I started using Spotify Premium. I don’t say this lightly, it has been the best
decision ever. The catalogue is un-ending, I have found some incredible music
through Spotify’s recommendations. The best artists I discovered last year were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Suzanne Vega</li>
  <li>Cass McCombs</li>
  <li>Elliot Smith</li>
  <li>Metronomy (co-worker played The Bay at a work mixer!)</li>
  <li>Jack White</li>
</ul>

<p>I also saw Metronomy perform live in Shibuya. I went to a bunch of classical
piano recitals at the Sumida Triphony Hall. <strong>And</strong> I saw Max Richter perform
Memoryhouse and Blue Notebooks live!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Visit the Ironbound market in Pennsylvania and Torbay in Devon,
England. Use the Spotify API to backup the monthly playlists in a spreadsheet
and store that in Dropbox.</p>

<h2 id="tv-and-movies">TV and Movies</h2>

<p>At long last, I got into The Office (US) and started watching it. I like the
first four seasons, I am still ambivalent about the later seasons. I watched
several episodes of Seinfeld and Modern Family repeatedly. Seinfeld still
remains at the top of my list for comfort-TV!</p>

<p>I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrace_House_(franchise)">Terrace House</a> and watched all it’s existing seasons. It is a
unique kind of unscripted show and probably one of the most useful resources in
my efforts to learn Japanese.</p>

<p>I didn’t watch as many new movies as I would have liked to. Coffee in Berlin
(2014) was a really good movie that I watched randomly on a flight. I can’t
think of any other movie that I watched for the first time in 2019. A dismal
showing.</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>

<p>I came across and started using a lot of stuff. The changes in <a href="https://github.com/icyflame/dotfiles/compare/master@%7B2019-01-01%7D...master@%7B2019-12-31%7D">my dotfiles</a>
over the year are especially indicative of this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Started using prezto instead of zsh</li>
  <li>Wrote the command prompt in prezto so that it would be exactly like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ys</code> in
zsh. This took me a good 3 hours, but I think it was perhaps the best use of
my time! I know exactly how to change every single character in the prompt
now!</li>
  <li>Configured Vim to work as I expected and wanted it to. I started using
Slimux and UltiSnips among a lot of other plugins which were especially useful
at work. I wrote my first Vim function and Vim plugin and realized the
opportunities that I had to customize it further</li>
  <li>Customized the statusline for Vim and Tmux. Tmux bindings to resize by
entering the width and height</li>
  <li>Re-mapped <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CAPS</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ESC</code> =&gt; This was a co-worker’s recommendation and it has
been a game changer for me. My hands move less and it’s incredibly convenient
because I never used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CAPS</code> key before. On the flip side, I have gotten
much slower at using someone else’s computer when they don’t have this
mapping.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from the configuration changes, I wrote a lot of bash and subsequently, I
am actually okay at it now. I don’t have to look at the Bash Comparison
operators and Bash if-else operators help page as often as I used to. I got
slghtly better at awk and sed, but my proficiency in those hasn’t increased
substantially.</p>

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>

<p>2019 was my first full year at work. I learned several new things about
organizations and how they work. I learnt more about Search and Golang. I
reviewed a lot of code and would like to think that I got better at reviewing
and getting reviews, but that’s questionable at best. I got used to the
development process at work and I got used to my role in it. I have only been at
work a year now, so I can’t really say I gained a lot of insights about anything
in particular.</p>

<p>I <em>did</em> get much better at explaining complex concepts to people in the same
room and people halfway across the world by sharing my screens and preparing UML
diagrams. I started writing basic PlantUML without looking at the <a href="https://plantuml-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/diagrams/sequence.html">PlantUML
examples</a> webpage. Still a long way to go though, my diagrams often miss
boxes because I don’t know how to make them off the top of my head.</p>

<p>And finally, I got better at taking notes that will stay with me forever. I have
a simple system of one file per month, I keep writing things in that file and
keep everything in the same folder. Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ag</code>, I can search for anything no
matter when I wrote it and this has been helpful especially when I want to find
out the reason for some of my choices, a few months down the line. I am writing
everything in Markdown (including this post) and I am looking forward to
building more tools around my workflow.</p>
