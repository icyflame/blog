  <p>There were some serious <em>production issues</em> in the past couple of posts. The
images were not properly downloaded (I downloaded them using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wget</code> and that
didn’t work out), titles were not right, categories weren’t added. I have fixed
all of that now, there was even a spelling mistake, a hilarious one too. I had
mis-spelled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">synced</code> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sinked</code>, I didn’t even notice it when I was typing!</p>

<p>Anyway, the quality of everything should improve from here on out, I am going to
visit the post and skim it right after posting. I think I should talk about why
I am using Jekyll for this whole series and also as my primary blog when there
are much simpler alternatives like Medium out there.</p>

<p>I have been <em>trying</em> to blog for a while now. I first had a <a href="https://mylifeatiitkgp.wordpress.com/">Wordpress
blog</a> on Wordpress.com. (I logged into it
after 3 years with just one password attempt.  MEMORY GOING STRONG.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I have just been seeing my posts, and there is a <strong>lot</strong> of text on that
blog. I used to write quite a bit about TV series and things that happen inside
IIT Kharagpur. This was about 4 years ago when I had a slower laptop. It was a
Toshiba and it choked on running Google Chrome and EiskaltDC++ together. That
laptop was the reason that I was using the terminal for almost everything from
launching videos in VLC to editing with vim instead of Sublime Text because it
was too slow. (It had a Pentium processor, I think with 2 GB RAM. OLD!) Back
then, jekyll was just becoming popular with the whole Github pages thing being
rather new. So, I found a good theme and got started with publishing on GitHub.
There was maybe a 2 year hiatus after which I started this particular series and
started posting regularly. In the time in between, I posted semi-regularly,
about once in every 3 or 4 months. <a href="https://mylifeatiitkgp.wordpress.com/">Wordpress
archives</a> [I can’t seem to get a list of
all my posts on wordpress, only monthly archives]</p>

<p>In between this, I also used <a href="http://the-shorter-posts.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>. I
really wanted to like it. It looked good on browsers and on mobile, I could
repost stuff from blogs I follow and post them there. This blog was mostly
quotes from the ASOIAF book series which I was reading for most of 2015 and the
early part of 2016. I also posted some normal write-ups about the status of my
life. I never used the mobile app for posting anything, only for browsing other
blogs that I followed, but the interest faded away soon and I stopped posting. I
wrote about 40 posts over a period of 10 months from November 2015 to August 2016. 
The most number of posts were in the first month, and then it came down
exponentially. <a href="http://the-shorter-posts.tumblr.com/archive/">Archive of Tumblr</a></p>

<p>And, now I am back here since August 2016, I had not written anything before I
started this series. I felt really bad about not writing. In March 2016, right
before starting my internship, I <a href="https://medium.com/@icyflame/i-am-going-to-start-writing-ceac3e108c28#.i543sko4h">promised on
Medium</a> 
that I am going to start writing more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, I read <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/why-i-don-t-read-100-books-a-year-70452d5373d4#.pyl5m35ag">this essay on medium</a>, 
and realized that it applied to me. Not the
not reading 100 books a year part, I absolutely love reading and will continue
to read a lot, but I should start writing, despite not being good at it and all
that, one thing that made absolute sense was that I should start writing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am sure it was just laziness that caused me to not go through with this
particular plan of mine. But I would say that I still had the last laugh, even
if it was 9 months later than I had said I would start, I started and now I am
37 days in! GREAT!</p>

<p><strong>TL; DR</strong> I used Wordpress, then I used Jekyll for some time before switching to
Tumblr for 9 months and then not writing anything for 4 months and finally
starting this series on Jekyll.</p>

<p>I will now push this post and check if the table was rendered properly. I am 60%
confident that it won’t render properly. It has never worked for me on the first
attempt! It’s always been a struggle.</p>

<p>EDIT: The 40% won out! I was finally able to write a Markdown table and have it
rendered the way I wanted in the first attempt!</p>
