  <p>HALF WAY THERE!</p>

<p>I have been writing a daily blog post for the past 50 days. A lot happened and
through that time, and I will probably write a summary of all of it once I am
totally done with the #100DaysOfWriting challenge.</p>

<p>Today, I ran the <a href="https://github.com/x0rz/tweets_analyzer">x0rz/tweets_analyser</a>
repository using a Twitter API key and I must say that the data that it threw
out was very very fun!</p>

<p>Of course, I first analyzed my Twitter account: @_icyflame</p>

<p>In the timings that I have tweeted in most over the past 1000 tweets (in 372
days or there abouts), I have NEVER tweeted between 3 am - 4 am and between 5 am
and 7 am. I would have believed that I would have probably tweeted at all times
of day atleast by now!</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/day-50-1.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>The break up for different week days wasn’t interesting. The distribution was
almost uniform throughout the week. I had only one Geotagged tweet and that was
from Kharagpur! So, I think I am doing pretty well there, security wise.</p>

<p>Most used Hashtags was surprising though. I would have definitely thought it
should have been Homeland, but it was GameOfThrones by a narrow single
occurence!</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/day-50-2.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>Atleast @SHO_Homeland was my most mentioned user. That amounts to some
redemption. I do love Homeland much much more than I love the 6th season of GoT.</p>

<p>And finally, the domains of the URLs that I keep tweeting. Most of them are
goodreads, considering that all of my activity gets mirrored here this is not
surprising. After Goodreads, the common ones are my blog’s domain, Youtube and
github.com. None of that is surprising in the least!</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/day-50-3.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>I went on to analyse @dhh, @CaseyNeistat, @MKBHD, @eevee. All of these accounts
are very active accounts. Their last 1000 tweets came in at the last 72,
128, 85, and 14 days. There’s a lot of insight to be gained about sleep cycles
and the people they follow and are closely connected to.</p>

<p>This is a great tool! I have wanted to build something of this sort for git for
so long now. I think I already said this in an earlier post here, but I do
really want to build this. (In one of Linus Torvalds’ interviews, he said that
he ran some analyses and found that most kernel developers now work between
standard times like 9-6. I don’t know how he found that out, but it probably
took him a few minutes to write the whole thing in C or bash(?). I have a
feeling he didn’t use a wrapper like Grub or git-ruby to write that.</p>

<p>I also stumbled onto <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/63sgik/rplace_and_the_implications_to_sociology/">this
discussion</a> 
on r/sociology about the latest r/place
experiment. I think this is the right place to get more insight on what really
happened there and what all people could read from it! I saw the Timelapse
video. It game me some perspective over the HUGENESS of the canvas and there
were so many thing going on at the same time that it was very hard to follow
through manually. I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/63sgik/rplace_and_the_implications_to_sociology/dg07d3z/">wrote
down</a>
what I thought about some of the major battles that I could notice after
watching the timelapse a couple of times.</p>

<p><strong>POST #50 is OVER</strong></p>
