  <p>A new day, a new attack on HTTPS.</p>

<p>Checking certificates is a great practice, and almost always I stop after
opening a certificate and looking at the certificate signing chain. That tells
most of the story. Specifically, when using some other computer, it tells you
whether the computer’s owner is trying to fake some certificate sign by putting
a malicious Gmail certificate on the computer and effectively implementing a
MITM attack. It’s as simple as installing <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/">MITM Proxy</a>
which automatically creates a certificate and adds it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/ssl/certs</code>.</p>

<p>The best way to avoid this is to not login on any unknown device, at all. There
are some guidelines like these that I have learned from experience, and although
listing them all down is going to be next to impossible, I can try.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DO</strong> use Google Authenticator for 2-Factor Authentication. Use it for all the accounts that
tell the world who you are: Email, Twitter (THEY IMPLEMENTED IT!), LastPass, GitHub, Digital
Ocean, Slack. (Those are <em>a few</em> of the services I use 2FA for)</p>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/854151800462741506"><img src="/public/img/2017-04-18-twitter.png" alt="twitter-screenshot" /></a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DON’T</strong> login to your core accounts on an unknown computer. There could be
anything ranging from a hardware keylogger that you didn’t notice, a software
keylogger which can be installed in 2 minutes on Windows or a malicious SSL
MITM attacker who went to the pain of faking a certificate chain to reduce
your suspicions. JUST DON’T. To download or share files, read the next point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DO</strong> setup a publicly viewable Google Drive folder and create a shortlink
for that folder and add it to your contacts. Whenever you want to download
something on a strange computer, use your phone to put it on the public
folder, download it and then delete it from Drive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DO</strong> use DuckDuckGo. They don’t track you, they don’t even ask you to sign
in. If you must use Google because sometimes DDG just doesn’t cut it, open
Incognito and use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!google</code> before your query. That way the searches are not
tied to your account and you can save yourself from targetted advertising
based on your searches.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DO</strong> use a VPN whenever using Public WiFi. Something as simple as Surfeasy
is enough to thwart people trying to spy on you using simple things like
Wireshark. I know hardly anything about the myriad list of tools available
out there to spy on people who are using a public network. Using a VPN should
preclude some really basic attacks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DON’T</strong> enter your Bank Password or anything related to Internet Banking
<em>WITHOUT</em> first checking the SSL certificate of the website. If chrome shows
the green bar, don’t stop there. Press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CTRL+SHIFT+I</code>, open the certificate
and atleast look at the certificate. Look at the spelling of the website (Our
brain does this weird thing where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://onlinsbi.com</code> looks so so
similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://onlinesbi.com</code>. I used to be terrified of this particular
attack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DO</strong> use <em>STRONG PASSWORDS</em>. This is a no-brainer, really, but I still feel
like I must say this. 8 character long passwords are the bare minimum and
just don’t cut it. Something as simple as
<a href="https://www.thc.org/thc-hydra/">thc-hydra</a> has bruteforcing options for
passwords that are this small.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DO</strong> use LONG RSA keys. If possible, use Elliptic Curve keys. In any case,
your default RSA key should ideally be 4096 bits long. <a href="https://blog.g3rt.nl/upgrade-your-ssh-keys.html">This guide will help
you upgrade your keys</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DO</strong> have a small Pendrive that has your RSA keys, PGP keys (Who uses PGP
anymore?), your 2FA recovery codes. Take it with you whenever you are going
on a sufficiently long trip. <strong>Remember to use LUKS</strong> and encrypt the
partition that has all this data. Otherwise, you are just inviting trouble.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DO</strong> uninstall <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssh-server</code> from your main computer. It’s an annoying
package that doesn’t come pre-installed in Ubuntu, but if you ended up
installing it somehow, uninstall it right now! <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sshd</code> is one of those
tunnels into your machine you didn’t even know existed until someone walked
right in and stole files from you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DO</strong> follow Security and Cryptography blogs using something like Feedly.
The best two out there right now are
<a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/">cryptographyengineering.com</a> and
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier on Security</a>. If you use Twitter
a lot, follow some Security driven accounts like
<a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">Filippo</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity">@SwiftOnSecurity</a>, and
<a href="https://twitter.com/evacide">@evacide</a>. I know I follow a lot more people
who are in the <em>industry</em>, but I can’t seem to remember them. I would like
to create a Twitter list of these people and then, pass that list around.
(That list probably already exists?)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DO</strong> follow Cryptography news closely and go beyond the mainstream media
to find out <em>exactly</em> what the attack is. Media headlines are generally
click-baity and say things like <strong>The NSA can now see your bank passwords</strong>
when the actual attack is an attack on HTTPS which requires a
particular set of conditions to be met, and these conditions are never
really met for most people. This is just a random example. My point is: Go
beyond the mainstream media, go to the paper / article that the attacker
published, read through it, think about it, and finally, <strong>take measures to
preclude it.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DO</strong> use Full Disk Encryption on your Ubuntu main computer. It’s a pain to
setup, you probably are going to have to take a whole backup and then
encrypt and copy back to your disk. I did it when I re-installed Ubuntu. Do
it right away, it is well worth it. If you don’t do it right now,
<em>definitely</em> do it the next time you upgrade your operating system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DO</strong> <a href="https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/2017/03/31/day-42/">tape your
webcam</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That list is no way complete. I am sure I must have missed some major point that
I really wanted to tell people about, but didn’t include in this list. I won’t
be editing this list though, I will probably publish a better version of this
list in a couple months, if I have something more to say.</p>

<p>The bottomline is: <strong>do your best to close all the doors and windows and
air-conditioning ducts</strong> that enter your online apartment. If you leave doors
open, people <em>will</em> try to get in. If you close most of the doors, they will be
discouraged, and (hopefully) leave you alone and target someone who is more
vulnerable. And if you find that a door has been inadvertently left open, <strong>TAKE
ACTION!</strong> Inaction now and regret later are a toxic combination, and the
helplessness when you realise that you could have and <em>should have</em> taken steps
after you have been attacked doesn’t help. It’s a bad bad feeling.</p>

<p><strong>POST #59 is OVER</strong></p>

<p>P.S. I am pretty sure this is one of the most coherent posts in this series. I
have been writing this post for the past 45 minutes.</p>
