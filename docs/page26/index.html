        <p><strong>This is a non-geek, super-normal Indian Railways traveller post!</strong></p> <p>This is a post that I am writing as I move rapidly towards Chennai, my final destination! The summer at KGP is over, and now, I go back home! (The train itself is around 5 hours late, so, in place of reaching Chennai at around 2300, I will be reaching around 0500 or 0600 the next morning.)</p> <p>Trains are great places, if you get the right berth and the right set of people to travel with. In India, the set of people that you are travelling with takes on a more than could be expected level of importance, when you are travelling alone. This is because a lone traveller (wolf) on...

        <p>In the about page of this blog, I talked about the application <a href="">Terminator</a> and how it is part of my virtual workspace, apart from Vim, Sublime, Git and Linux!</p> <p>But then, I came across Tmux, and it seemed interesting. It was a pain to get started with, to be honest. The default prefix key is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+B</code>, and having to press that before even switching panes in a window, that was a pane. (Did I mean <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pain</code>?)</p> <p>Anyways, I went through the documentation and didn’t really understand much at the beginning. It was all panes, windows, sessions, servers, clients, and so on. I had to start using this, and just hope that somewhere down the line...

        <p>So, after that marathon of two posts on the same day (which had a slight issue in formatting the first time I published it), this is my post about GruntJS, again!</p> <p>I posted about GruntJS once <a href="http://icyflame.github.io/blog/web-development/2015/03/30/grunt-js-is-awesome/">before</a>. That was the basic configuration that I had got going on the first time around. It didn’t do much. Just the basic plugins: prettifying the HTML, minifying the CSS and JavaScript and the Watch plugin, for automatic plugins.</p> <p>Soon after that, I realised that my builds were just taking too long, which was when a little bit of research led me to <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/tooling/supercharging-your-gruntfile/">this article</a>. That article was awesome!</p> <p>Reading the article, I was convinced that I just had to use the...

        <p>This post is long overdue. Now, that the semester is over, I have found time to do two of the things that I intend to completely master over the summer: NodeJS and Formula 1 2014. While the first is a programming framework which has a staggering amount of possibilities, the latter is a game for the PC, that has completly taken me out.</p> <p>I started playing F1 2014 sometime around March, this year, and I found it to be really boring in the beginning. But then, I got into seeing gameplay videos of the game. And in particular, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tiametmarduk1">this YouTube channel</a>, where videos are uploaded by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/tiametmarduk">this guy</a>. The gameplay videos are great! Fun to watch, but the...

        <p>So, this is probably my first <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rant</code> per se, on anything related to Ruby on Rails. And it’s connected with a step that just can’t be avoided by any Rails application: Production.</p> <p>Rant begin.</p> <p>I never thought this would be much of a problem, since I had been using Heroku almost all my time with Rails, and deploys were super quick, and super-easy! Hardly ever did I run into any walls, and even when I did, the documentation on Heroku and Stack Overflow was more than enough to get me up and running soon.</p> <p>Enter, Inhouse Server. So, in IITKGP, we have a set of servers that we administer as part of Students’ Alumni Cell, and they are...

        <p>So, finally, after a long long time, during a particular project, I got the chance to get my hands dirty with the JavaScript Task Runner, <a href="http://gruntjs.com">GruntJS</a>.</p> <p>Now, I have been using Sublime Text and the auto-indent function that is embedded with it for almost a year, or perhaps, more than that! But one thing that has been sub-par is definitely the quality of code that comes out of this engine. A lot of the tags are not indented properly. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> are in the next level of indentation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> tags. And inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code>, if a tag is closed in the same line, then the whole indentation breaks.</p> <p>This was when I remembered reading...

        <p>Ruby on Rails &lt;3</p> <p>Finally, we have rolled out our first ever production application written in Ruby on Rails. And by “we” I mean the Students’ Alumni Cell. This is the first time that SAC has deployed a RoR app. We have been joint at the hips with PHP and CodeIgniter for some time.</p> <p>The application is the Mentorship Portal, which is a centralized portal for the registration of mentors and students, and at a later point in time, we will also do the allotments through this portal. It’s an application written in RoR.</p> <p>There are some things about this application that I really want to say now:</p> <ul> <li>The templating language is ERB, for no other reason than that...

Last year’s Agni’s performance and Salim-Sulaiman’s performance does compare to this performance but only to some extent!</p> <p>This is going to be a short post because as I speak, I am inching closer to a Thermodynamics test. The test starts at 5:30, about 3.5 hours from now, and the thing to be highlighted about the test is that it is goign to...

        <p>Soon after getting acquainted with Vim, I had to change my machine. My old Toshiba, with 3 Gigs of RAM and an Intel Pentium at it’s heart, had a broken display, and it was not cutting it anymore.</p> <p>The new machine is armed with 4 Gigs of RAM, a 4th Gen i5, and 2 GB of AMD Radeon Graphics. It came pre-installed with Windows 8.1. And when I bought it, I had all the intention required to change the operating system to something faster and much more customisable and useful for stuff like Git, Rails and all else, Of course, Ubuntu!</p> <p>My config on the old laptop was perfect and well toned. Over the past year and a half, I...

        <p>The Fall semester ended on Dec 28th. And after that a lot of things have happenned. It’s been a long time since I wrote a post, because I have hardly had any time, since then. I am leaving for home day after tomorrow. And now finally, all the tasks are moving into “pack-up” phase.</p> <p>There have been many changes to my development environment in these two weeks. The most important is the integration of Vim into the scheme of things.</p> <p>For some time now, I have been trying to get into this amazing command line editor that almost everyone seems to love so much.</p> <p>Almost always, whenever I started using Vim, I got frustrated and left it to go back...
