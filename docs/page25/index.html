It is incredibly useful whenever you are travelling or going somewhere without Internet access (God Forbid!). But there is one thing that I have never been able to get over, about Pocket, and it’s that although, it’s a great store for articles until you read them, once you have read them, it’s not a good store at all. For one, all stored articles take up space on your mobile, tablets etc. Next, the tagging system doesn’t really work that way. Going into the Read / Archived section will show you a list of Links, and there’s no way (except...

        <p>Node 4.x was released. Hmm, now that is a huge jump! I have been using Node 0.10.32 and Node 0.12.7 for most of my time in Node till now. I have known that a fork called io.js has been around for some time now, and has version numbers that have reached 3.x.</p> <p>When I realised that Node had updated it’s version to 4.x, the first thing that I thought of was that I had to update, and then I realized another thing: Backward compatibility. I have written about 20 Node modules, published on <a href="http://npmjs.com/~icyflame">npm</a> and they probably depend on close to 60-80 modules themselves. So, for everything to work perfectly, all of these 100 modules need to be written...

        <p>So, one of the few things that almost everyone does after their mid-term exams are over is <em>chill out</em>!</p> <p>I chose to do this using my browser as well! I was browsing GitHub repositories to contribute to, solving and creating issues on projects I maintain and running music in a tab using YouTube.</p> <p>Lately, I had been slightly irritated with the RAM usage of Chromium. It uses about 70% of Memory and 50% of CPU. I still stuck to it because of the great plugin community around Chrome, the really tight integration with most of Google’s services. I liked the Checker Plus for Gmail plugin for Chrome, and this was very important for me. But, enough was enough!</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The...

        <p>Mid-term exams are almost over. One more paper to go, and there’s enough time to study for that. So, I worked on the project that I have been working on for about a week now.</p> <p>My ultimate goal for building this CLI module was to basically ensure that I didn’t have to visit the <a href="http://irctc.co.in">IRCTC website</a> whenever I wanted to check the status of all the tickets that I have booked. (After the ARP for booking tickets was extended to four months, I can book tickets for February 2016 today!)</p> <p>Thus, a lot of tickets, and a really really slow website. But there’s one thing that’s not slow, or atleast not as slow as the website itself. The API...

        <p><strong>Update:</strong> I didn’t really end up doing this internship because on January 12, 2016, TinyOwl revoked the internship offers that it had made to 7 people in IIT Kharagpur due to internal turmoil. I don’t have the heart to remove this post because this is exactly how I felt at the end of the interview, and I want this to be out there for other people searching about TinyOwl.</p> <p><a href="http://tinyowl.com/"><img src="/public/img/tinyowl.jpg" alt="tinyowl-logo" /></a></p> <p>So, this post is long overdue. On 30th August, 2015, TinyOwl visited IIT Kharagpur to recruit interns for their internship program, during the months of May-July, 2016.</p> <p>The first thing I noticed when I saw their intenship notification form on the ERP, was that they used...

        <p>I am a lover of projects with clean history. They always end up being some of the best maintained and working projects. I guess I must refer to the big Dad of all Open Source repositories, Linux when I refer to this. Looking at the history in it’s <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">GitHub Repo</a>, it’s full of merge commits that make sense. You can see the changes going up the ladder, and Linus Torvalds accepting them.</p> <p>Git Flow does essentially that. Git has a lot of options that you can take, as a maintainer, you are just confused and you let the history decay. Git Flow ensures you don’t.</p> <p>The basic <em>funda</em> behind Git Flow is that there are two branches, <code class="language-plaintext...

        <p>Ruby on Rails is built on the principle of convention over configuration. Right upto now, I have deployed production applications on an in house server which invariably ran into some wall or the other. (Check out my rant about this <a href="http://icyflame.github.io/blog/web-development/2015/05/01/deploying-on-an-inhouse-server/">here</a>) Meanwhile, we did test runs of all the applications on Heroku, and that ran without any issues, almost all the time. (Except a couple of times, before I discovered <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rails_12factor</code> ) But this flawless ness was never put to the test, in a live environment, with lots of non-developers, users using it.</p> <p>Finally, today, I got the chance to deploy <a href="http://github.com/icyflame/erp-rails">erp-rails</a> to Heroku. (Huge sigh of relief!) It is now deployed and ready to be...

        <p>After starting to follow <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus">@sindresorhus</a> and <a href="http://github.com/kevva">@kevva</a>, the one thing that started filling my GitHub timeline, were repositories like [is-online], [wifi-password], [is-video], etc. These were NodeJS repositories that did something really simple, like checking if the computer was online, confirming if the file that the path points to is a video or not.</p> <p>The one other thing that was interesting was that these ran from a NodeJS script as well as the CLI. It seemded like one of the easiest method to package a CLI application. And thus, started a journey across @sindresorhus and @kevva’s code. Finding the place where this code exactly was took more time than I thought. Checking through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> file, I...
