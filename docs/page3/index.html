        <p>I have been experimenting with keyboards for the past several years and in February this year, I
switched to a keyboard which I hope will be the last keyboard I <em>ever</em> buy. The whole point of
switching keyboards all this while was to buy the right version of this keyboard, <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">the Ergodox EZ</a>. It
is a split keyboard with an ortholinear layout. It is an expensive keyboard and can be customized to
an (almost) limitless extent. It has several extra keys which can be programmed to do whatever you
want them to such as function keys or macros. This post is a log of the keyboards I bought (and sold
off) during this process.</p>

        <p>Allen’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11569567-global-economic-history?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=uJtJAM2HGg&amp;rank=1">Global Economic History: A Very Short Introduction</a> is a 200-page masterpiece. It packs a
huge amount of history. It looks far enough into the past to set the scene for the Industrial
Revolution and the economic gains seen as a result of it. Then, Allen retreats into the fundamentals
of economic development and goes over the main reasons some countries are perennially stuck in the
“middle income trap.” He has some advice for such economies and what they might be able to do to get
out of this trap. This book is solidly based in data. But Allen does not prioritize data over the
story. Economics is the story of real people who live in each of these countries. Allen never loses
sight of this, and always puts large economic shifts in context by stressing on how it impacts
everyday life. This emphasis on personal experience makes the book a study in the government
policies that work and the pitfalls to keep in mind.</p>

        <p>TikTok is the most talked about social media platform now. Articles about the impact it is having
are published regularly in mainstream publications. People are constantly writing editorials about
what it is, how it became popular, how it is owned by a Chinese company (and thus, controlled by the
Chinese government), etc. I had read enough of it that I wanted to give it a try. I wanted to be a
viewer on TikTok for a week (originally) to understand what it is <em>really</em> like. I ended up being on
it for about a month. This was because I was not completely convinced that I had used all the
features in the product after a week. Then, I gradually realized what was really going on: <strong>TikTok
is incredibly simple; it requires no interaction from the user except for scrolling down.</strong> It is
built with a singular focus on convincing people to imitate the trend that is “going viral” at any
given point.  There are many moving elements around the screen, and some of them are integrations
with other businesses, which TikTok or the creator possibly makes money from. I think that TikTok is
popular today because it solved a content creator’s <strong>biggest problem</strong>: <strong>The requirement to be
<em>original.</em></strong> <strong>Nothing</strong> is original on TikTok. Everything is a copy of a copy of a copy of a
copy. But these are not copies. They are <strong>participants in a trend.</strong></p>

        <p>I understand the economics behind advertising. Advertising can be used to subsidize
content. However, I refuse to accept that Bloomberg.com needs to show advertisements to a paying
subscriber.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This comes down to personal preference: If you believe that advertisements are a
net good and support the work that you are viewing “for free”, so be it. I do <strong>not</strong> believe that. If
I must pay for content that is ostensibly “free” by having my attention distracted by an
advertisement which I did not ask for and am not interested in, then I reserve the right to use
every tool in my arsenal to avoid seeing the advertisement. All of this is just a preamble to a
recent change I made in one of the central components that I use to browse the Internet: my DNS
server. I switched from Pi-hole, a popular adblocking DNS server, to CoreDNS and <a href="https://github.com/icyflame/blocker">a plugin for ad
blocking</a> which I wrote. This is a post about why I decided to <strong>reinvent the wheel.</strong></p>

        <p>A Burning is ostensibly about 3 people. Their lives are entwined in rather banal ways: teacher, a
former student, a young woman helping a slum dweller learn English, a transgender beggar who is
learning acting, an acting teacher who has never had a real audience. Their hopes and dreams are
conventional: The young woman gets into a good school and manages to escape her past and moves
solidly into the middle class. The slum dweller hopes to learn acting and make it big in the movie
industry. Under this shroud of normalcy, and sometimes using it as a tool, Majumdar captures the
depressing nature of the life they lead. And these characters stand-in for a whole group of people;
the group that has missed the social mobility bus; the bus was packed in the 1970s with first-time
engineers and doctors and lies overturned on the side of the highway today.</p>

        <p>Gaslighting is a catch-all term. I understand it as the act of relentlessly bombarding a consumer of
information with a large amount of irrelevant statistics and facts to such an extent that the victim
can no longer convincingly explain (even to themselves) their fundamental beliefs. There is a lot of
talk of “gaslighting” in media environments where there is a single source of news. In India,
nightly news shows are a great example. It is also relevant in environments where a news source is
seen as biased. The biased news source’ reporting is criticized using a bunch of unrelated facts.</p>

<p>On the 28th and 29th of March 2022, there was a 2-day strike call in India. This news was reported
by the New York Times, and crucially, it was included in the “Daily Briefing” newsletter’s Asia
edition on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/briefing/biden-russia-oscars-will-smith-israel.html">28th March, 2022</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I had not heard about the strike. (Not surprising, as I don’t
live in India and have been more out of the loop than usual lately.) None of the people I know in
India mentioned it to me over the previous weekend. When I read about the strike, I did <strong>not</strong> think
that NYT was reporting a lie. I accepted it as fact and went to a few Indian news websites to read
more about the strike. Quickly, I started questioning what was going on and why real people (not
“trolls”) were saying absurd things online. I am not the first person to go through this
disorienting experience and I won’t be the last. I want to talk about why I felt disoriented, how I
battled with this feeling, and how I managed to resolve my disorientation by doing some research.</p>

        <p>I am not one to balk when it comes to writing rants and leaving it at that. However, when publishing
rants, I think it is worthwhile to also think about the problems and try to figure out whether there
is some solution to the problems that one is ranting about. Often, there is no such solution. If an
easy solution did exist, there would be no need to find catharsis through the process of writing a
rant. In the case of the Absurd Customer Service problem though, there <em>are</em> some solutions. Some of
these are practical and can be adopted in our daily lives. While others are absurd; for the
absurdity of the solution must mirror the absurdity of the problem.</p>

<p>(This is the second post in a 2-part series about absurd customer service experiences. You can read
<a href="/2022/04/30/absurd-customer-service-part-1">the first part here</a>.)</p>

        <p>Over a series of several occasions last year, I experienced the absurdity rife in modern customer
service. I don’t think that things have always been like this. Customer service was a pain and you
would often by stuck on 30 minute phone calls trying to explain your situation to the other
person. But there <strong>was</strong> a person at the other end. And after those grueling 30 minutes, they <strong>would</strong>
understand your situation and do something to rescue you from it. My experiences did not conform to
this pattern. It looks like this problem is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/phone-scam-phishing-finance-apps/">widespread enough</a> to warrant feature articles in
magazines.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Indeed, in all the cases that I encountered, the problem was eventually resolved in a
miraculous and bizarre fashion; with my interventions seemingly making no impact on the course of
things. My experiences were with multiple businesses and in different industries: telecom, banking,
and retail. But I think that there are some common trends which can be pinpointed. These trends have
made the experience of “reaching out to customer support” in India a painful and exasperating
experience. In this, the first of a 2 part series, I briefly recount my experiences. Hopefully, the
reader has not been through similar experiences and can read them simply as an amusing recounting of
events that will never happen to them.</p>

        <p>Everyone agrees that Facebook makes them feel worse. It accelerates the “Fear Of Missing Out”
anxiety that is quite strong <em>even</em> when you don’t know <strong>exactly</strong> what your peers are doing on a
Friday evening. But people continue to flock to Facebook. Yes, Facebook is losing teen users<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>,
but this is not a precipitous drop. In any case, these teenagers are going to other platforms which
are arguably worse than Facebook for reasons that I will outline in this post. What is so
interesting on Facebook? Why does it exist? What is it for?  These are incredibly complex questions.
I will leave that hardest-of-all tasks to the technology philosophers. Instead, I will focus on the
one thing that became clear to me after a recent conversation: The existence of Facebook is an
anomaly. Facebook’s target user base will never need to use Facebook: Facebook is meant to “connect
people.” Their belief is that if you know what is on your friends’ mind, then you are connected to
them. The better you know someone, the more connected you are to them. The more you will be able to
appreciate the posts they make, both personal and political. <strong>But</strong> the better you know someone, the
less you need a tool such as Facebook to keep that relationship alive and healthy. So, you don’t
need Facebook to connect with the people whom you are closest with in the world.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> <strong>So, …,
what gives?</strong> Why are you on a platform where you are connecting with a bunch of people whom you know
only vaguely and care about at the superficial level? I have some thoughts about this dichotomy.</p>

        <p>The month of February is before the end of the financial year and the month that many governments
release their budgets for the next financial year. They also talk (at length) about the policies
that they are going to implement.  To commemorate this annual exercise in long-term decision making,
this month’s list of recommendations is about <strong>politics and government policy.</strong> We see examples of
government policy gone wrong and those that worked out well. There is an interesting new theory
about conservatism and the feeling of disgust (not just at <em>liberal</em> ideas, but a more <em>generic</em>
form of disgust.) And there is an article about degrowth from Vox, which has been making the rounds
periodically since 2019. It is worth looking back on this article periodically to understand how
futile unilateral action can prove to be.</p>
