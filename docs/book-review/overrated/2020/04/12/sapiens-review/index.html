  <p>I have been hearing about Sapiens since April 2018. A friend in university read
that book and told me that it was really good and that it changed the way they
thought about a lot of things. I wanted to read the book but it was never very
high on my list. This past Friday, I read <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/17/yuval-noah-harari-gives-the-really-big-picture">a profile of the author</a>, Yuval Noah
Harari in the New Yorker. This profile intrigued me because it told the story of
a university professor and a historian and even a philosopher who had some very
strange principles and said things that I had honestly never heard before. These
two quotes sealed the deal for me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In “Sapiens,” Harari writes in detail about a meeting in the desert between
Apollo 11 astronauts and a Native American who dictated a message for them to
take to the moon. The message, when later translated, was “They have come to
steal your lands.” Harari’s text acknowledges that the story might be a
“legend.”</p>

  <p>“I don’t know if it’s a true story,” Harari told me. “It doesn’t matter–it’s
a good story.” He rethought this. “It matters how you present it to the
readers. I think I took care to make sure that at least intelligent readers
will understand that it maybe didn’t happen.” (The story has been traced to a
Johnny Carson monologue.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to find out if I was an <em>intelligent reader</em>. And this one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Later this year, in Israel, Harari plans to have a private conversation with
Peterson. Harari said of Peterson’s representatives, “They offered to do a
public debate. And we said that we don’t want to, because there is a danger
that it will just be mud wrestling.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know much about Jordan Peterson but I have seen him talk about some
things when he was on the H3H3 podcast and the one feeling I didn’t get from him
was that he was someone who would get into mud wrestling on a public debate.
(Especially because they talk about his appearance on an English talk show and
how the anchor tries to <em>gotcha</em> him every single time but he is extremely
careful with his words and can effortlessly trace back to exactly what he said,
word for word, and explain to her why she is portraying things not as they are,
but as she wants them to be.</p>

<p>Now, I <em>absolutely had</em> to drop everything else and read Sapiens. I did just
that.</p>

<h3 id="review">Review</h3>

<p>The book is divided into three parts.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Don’t read Sapiens. Read Lever of Riches (Mokyr) to get a detailed
account of the last 2000 years of technological progress and Factfulness
(Rosling) to learn about the social advancements that we have made since ancient
times and feel good about progress.</p>

<p>There aren’t a lot of original insights in this book, there’s a lot of
speculation without any backing in facts or in arguments. The prose isn’t
concrete enough to be history and isn’t abstract or argumentative enough to be
philosophy. It is extremely easy to read and that is concerning to me because of
the purported subject of the book: “History of Humankind”.</p>

<p>Most people who read this review might disagree with me or might think that this
review is too harsh. I am confounded by the fact that so many people read this
book and found it to be useful. I want to understand how that could happen.
Perhaps, we can discuss why you thought it was a good book and what insights
were in it that I didn’t pick up on.</p>

<h4 id="part-1">Part 1</h4>

<p>The first part covers human “history” leading upto about 12,000 years ago. The
main event that it talks about is the Cognitive revolution about 70,000 years
ago at which point in time there were several species of the genus <em>Homo</em> on the
planet and the <em>sapiens</em> species was the first to start thinking. I have put the
word history in quotation marks because most of it is made up. There are no
written records (there wasn’t even writing yet) and there’s the flimsiest basis
for most of the claims made in this part if you consider archaelogical findings.
    The ethos of this part seems to be “If you don’t know what happened, make
    something up”</p>

<p>One particular passage sums up this part nicely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark. In modern times, a small difference in
skin color, dialect, or religion has been enough to prompt one group of
Sapiens to set about exterminating another group. Would Ancient Sapiens have
been any more tolerant towards an entirely different human species?  It may
well be that when Sapiens encountered Neanderthals, the result was the first
and most significant ethnic-cleansing campaign in history.</p>

  <p>– p.18</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This passage comes about 3 lines after the author admits that there are two
possibilites that expert have admitted: Sapiens exterminated Neanderthals either
intentionally or by simply being better at foraging and hunting everything before
Neanderthals could do anything OR Sapiens and Neanderthals intermixed and there
was no malicious extermination. You might have seen what path the author chose.
And perhaps you see why he chose that path. This passage is particularly hard to
look past because it’s the equivalent of something that talking heads say on TV
to get next day’s sound bite; it is sensational.</p>

<p>Part 1 is rife with such examples. Another classic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us. Domesticate comes from the
Latin <em>domus</em>, which means “house”. Who’s the one living in a house? Not the
wheat. It’s the Sapiens.</p>

  <p>– p.81</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And one last one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since we enjoy affluence and security, and since our affluence and security
are built on foundations laid by the Agricultural Revolution, we assume that
the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful improvement.  Yet it is wrong to
judge thousands of years of history from the perspective of today.</p>

  <p>– p.83</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s the thing: what he is talking about is not wrong. No one can say that it
is, because we <em>don’t know</em> what is right. We have absolutely no idea. No one
does because there are no records from this period of time. As there are no
records, one can say almost anything they want to about this period without
caussing much ire among any group of scholars. In my opinion, one should not
speculate about such things. Especially when the speculation is that it was a
tragic mis-step to move from foraging to agriculture and the implication is that
even though we have some comforts today the path we took to this state was not a
good one.</p>

<p>I know that books about a particular philosophy make such speculations. <em>That</em>
is completely acceptable as the author is trying to put forward an argument for
why things are the way they are. This is not philosophy. This book is not being
marketed as philosophy. The back cover of the book claims that it is related to
“Science” and nowhere does it indicate that everything in this book might not be
factual or even based on any evidence.</p>

<h4 id="part-2">Part 2</h4>

<p>This is the smallest part of the book. It talks about the effects of the
Agricultural Revolution, about 12,000 years ago. Here, we slowly lead up to the
invention of writing. Things start to get more concrete and the author moves
away from using <em>probably</em> and <em>perhaps</em>. There are fewer over-simplifications
in this part, but there is still a significant amount of “dumbing down” of
complicated topics for the benefit of the reader.</p>

<p>I didn’t really get any novel insights from this part either. Most of the stuff
being said is either mundane and known to everyone or hyperbole. I have tried to
find some original insight that I can highlight here but I am struggling to even
as I flip through the chapters to find something. This is a very good example of
the kind of hyperbole: The author’s argument is that moving from foraging to
agriculture was a tragic mis-step, people are supposedly working more hours,
dependent on nature’s whims hence making them more anxious and are getting less
nutrituous food in return. The only good point is that the food comes in
abundance and one doesn’t have to live hand-to-mouth which leads to an explosion
in population.</p>

<p>When discussing why such a mis-step was allowed to stand by thinking populations
and evolution, on a macro level, alike, here’s what is said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The above scenario explains the Agricultural Revolution as a mis-calculation.
It’s very plausible. History is full for far more idiotic mis-calculations.</p>

  <p>– p.89</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s no explanation about what those other <em>idiotic mis-calculations</em> were;
also, the very next paragraph explains another possibility which has written
evidence.</p>

<h4 id="part-3">Part 3</h4>

<p>This is the longest part and it’s about the unification of humanity into a
single world. For the first time in the book, there are some original insights.
Even though they are framed as bite-sized couplets that would look very good
with a contemplative image as background, they are insights nonetheless. here’s
the first one:</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/sapiens-1.png" alt="sapiens" /></p>

<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/c-qqleQ8REk">Photo by Christian Kielberg on Unsplash</a></p>

<p>I didn’t have time to make similar images for the other insights, but there are
some good ones. One particular story that I liked was about how James Cook’s
expedition out to Australia was actually as part of an expedition that the
British government had set up asking scientists to go to different places and
get some readings which would enable them to calculate the distance between the
Earth and the Sun accurately.</p>

<p>Another one was about how America was named after Amerigo even though the only
thing the Italian Amerigo did was say that the landmass that Columbus found were
part of an entirely unknown continent. This is a great piece of trivia.</p>

<p>There are more such pieces of trivia. But the major questions are left
unanswered and there aren’t even any solid serious arguments put forth about
them. For eg, the author started to make me uncomfortable for a few paragraphs
by saying that Communism and even Nazism were religions!!! They were not mere
ideologies that one could choose to believe at one point and not believe when
they did not feel like it, they were religions that one must convert to and
can’t leave without an official conversion, and so on. But after these few
paragraphs, he immediately backs off and doesn’t flesh it out any further. I
don’t think I would have the stomach to read about how Nazism is a religion (I
recently finished reading Diary of a Man in Despair) but for Communism, it would
have been an interesting argument to reason about. But the book disappoints by
not taking it any further. In fact, the author even says that it’s not of any
import what you call it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it makes you feel better, you can go on calling Communism an ideology and
rather than a religion. It makes no difference.</p>

  <p>– p.229</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this was indeed the case, then why make the initial argument and say that
they are religions?</p>

<p>Another question that is asked is about why the Chinese or the Mughals or the
Indians weren’t interested in going over to America and conquering those lands
for themselves despite finding out about European conquests on this new
    continent almost immediately and having the ocean navigation technology to
    get there. Readers of this blog might notice that this is extremely similar
    to the questions posed by Mokyr in Lever of Riches. The difference being
    that Mokyr presents the comparison in extreme detail and puts forth several
    arguments for why he thinks this could have been. Nothing of this sort can
    be found in Sapiens. The question is posed, and promptly forgotten about.</p>

<p>The last three chapters of the book are apart on their own. The book slowly
turns into a social commentary on our connected way of life, consumerism, people
buying things they don’t need, happiness being connected to what one feels
rather than what one has, “pauper can be happy if they have a loving family but a
lonely billionair can’t” and so on. Once again, there’s nothing particularly
revolutionary about anything being said. I felt like I was reading curated
Medium articles about capitalism, happiness, consumerism, the evils of shopping
malls, global trade connecting nations etc.</p>

<p>There are some hard to believe assertions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never before has peace been so prevalent that people could not even imagine
war</p>

  <p>– p.344</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author says this in reference to the post-WW2 period from 1945 to now. As
far as I can remember, most of the cold war was anxiety filled about an actual
war, there was an actual war in Vietnam, then several wars in the middle east.
In India and across the world, there was some terrible terrorism in the period
between 2000-2012. So, I would say that “people could not even imagine war” is
an exaggeration. There’s also no mention about the most peaceful period in
history which one might compare our own times against.</p>

<h3 id="some-quotes-from-the-book">Some quotes from the book</h3>

<p>An example of sentences that start with probably and how detailed they can be:
(emphasis on probably mine)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nomadic bands that stalked wild sheep gradualy altered the constitutions of
the herds on which they preyed.  <em>This process probably</em> began with selevive
hunting. Humans learnt that it was to their advantage to hunt only adult rams
and old or sick sheep. They spared fertile females and young lambs in order to
safeguard the long term vitality of the local herd. The second step might have
been to actively defend the herd againt predators. Driving away lions, wolves
and rival human bands. The band might next have coralled the herd into a
narrow gorge, in order to better control and defend it. Finally, people began
to make a more careful selection among the sheep, in order to tailer them to
human needs. The most aggresive rams, the ones that showed the greatest
resistance to human control, were slaughtered first. So were the skinniest
females and the most curious. With each passing generation, the sheep became
fatter more submissive and less curious. <em>Voila!</em> Mary had a little lamb and
everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go.</p>

  <p>– p.92</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example of the arguments that the author decided to back out of instead of
fleshing them out further:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it makes you feel better, you can go on calling Communism an ideology and
rather than a religion. It makes no difference.</p>

  <p>– p.229</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A crucial lack of explanation about what the theories are and why they aren’t
convincinng:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why did the Scientific Revolution begin there of all places, and not in China
or India? Why did it begin at the midpoint of the second millenium rather than
2 centuries before or 3 centuries later? We don’t know. Scholars have proposed
dozens of theories but none of them is convincing.</p>

  <p>– p.244</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For posterity, the arguments given in Lever of Riches (Mokyr) <em>are</em> convincing.
The least the author could do was at least point the reader to another book
which would summarize those theories.</p>

<p>P.S. I wrote about this on Twitter as I was reading the book:</p>
