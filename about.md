Hey! I am Siddharth Kannan. I am a Sophomore student of the Mechanical Engineering Department, at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. This is my blog, the area for my own musings!

My previous blog was at [WordPress](http://mylifeatiitkgp.wordpress.com), But I got pretty lazy because I had to open the browser and wait for the page to connect and login and all of that. So, I decided to come to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

And with the help of [Hyde](http://github.com/poole/hyde), built by [@mdo](http://twitter.com/mdo), I had my blog up and running! (Read my [post](http://icyflame.github.io/blog/web-development/2014/09/12/set-up-and-ready/) about the setup process.)

I love [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com),[jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com). And in general, just everything web and open-source. I am totally in love with Ruby on Rails. And have been developing Rails applications since September 2014, and have not looked for a more versatile, robust, back-end framework. I was an avid user of PHP before that. 

[Git](http://git-scm.com), paired with [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator) complete my virtual workspace! Add [Slack](http://slack.com) for Communication and [Trello](http://trello.com) for Task-lists, and I am at my productive peak. Ubuntu is my operating system of choice, although, I do have a dual-boot machine, with Windows 8 o nthe side. (Seldom does Windows get to see the light of day!)

Coming to the apps that have been deployed, I have used [Heroku](http://heroku.com) for deploying Rails applications. One of the applications written in Rails is now deployed on a Phusion Passenger Module, on an Apache Server [here](http://www.mentorship.iitkgp.ernet.in).

I am currently a <b>Creative Team Member</b> at the Students' Alumni Cell, IIT Kharagpur and a <b>Software Developer</b> at [Team AUV](http://github.com/iit-kgp-auv-team).
