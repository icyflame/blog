Hey! I am Siddharth Kannan. I am a Senior Undergraduate student of the
Mechanical Engineering Department, at the Indian Institute of Technology,
Kharagpur. This is my blog, the area for my own musings! I write about the books
I read, the code I write, the articles and videos I find on the Internet, and
(rarely) rant about my experiences with computers.

I wrote at [various
places](https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/writing/technology/wordpress/jekyll/programming/2017/03/26/day-37/)
before settling on this setup. Like a true content creator, I wrote a [blog
post](https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/writing/technology/wordpress/jekyll/programming/2017/03/26/day-37/)
even about the fact that I wrote in various places using various tools.

I love [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org),
[Android](https://www.android.com/),
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com),[jQuery](http://jquery.com) and
[GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com). In general, everything web, android and
open-source. I have ported an iOS application to Native Android in the summer of
2016\. I have been developing Rails applications since 2014, and have not looked
for a more versatile, robust, back-end framework. I was an avid user of PHP
before that. I have also dabbled around with Node.js: I built 24 NPM modules
which were downloaded a [total of 14,000
times](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?author=icyflame&from=2016-04-06&to=2017-04-06)
in the last 1 year. (ending April 6, 2017)

Vim, tmux, git and Firefox are the major parts of my daily setup!  Ubuntu is the
OS I have been using for the past few years. I have several gripes with it, but
it has to do for now. I still have Windows 8 on the side for Solidworks, Ansys,
Abaqus. I log into Windows far more frequently than I used to just two
years ago, but that will all stop within the next year, I could not be too happy
about that.

Check out my open-source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/icyflame). Check
out my NPM modules at [NPM](https://npmjs.org/~icyflame). I watch too many TV
series and incessantly talk about them on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/_icyflame).
