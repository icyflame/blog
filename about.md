Hey! I am Siddharth Kannan. I am a Sophomore student of the Mechanical Engineering Department, at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. This is my blog, the area for my own musings!

My previous blog was at [WordPress](http://mylifeatiitkgp.wordpress.com), But I got pretty lazy because I had to open the browser and wait for the page to connect and login and all of that. So, I decided to come to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

And with the help of [Hyde](http://github.com/poole/hyde), built by [@mdo](http://twitter.com/mdo), (Who is great!), I have my blog up and running! (The process was mostly painless, except for the `post.url` part, configuring which, took up about 50% of the hour that took to set everything up.)

I love [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com). And in general, just everything web and open-source. I am an avid user of PHP. And although, I have tried to move to Python (Read Django) and Ruby(Read Rails), I have not made the switch and have been faithful to PHP. (partly because, I am on Ubuntu 12.04 and setting stuff up is seldom painless!)

[Git](http://git-scm.com), paired with [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator) complete my virtual workspace!

My favourite MVC app-dev framework, for PHP, is [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter). I found this sometime around March, this year, and we have become pretty inseparable since.

I am trying to get on the [Laravel](http://laravel.com) wagon, and hope to be on it soon!

I am currently a <b>Creative Team Member</b> at the Students' Alumni Cell, IIT Kharagpur and a <b>Software Developer</b> at [Team AUV](http://github.com/iit-kgp-auv-team).

I am working on a couple of web applications right now, for SAC, and also, on the Image Processing Stack of Kraken 3.0, the latest version of our AUV. Check out the code on [GitHub](http://github.com/icyflame)!
