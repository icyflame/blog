Hey! I am Siddharth Kannan. I am a Software Engineer at Mercari in Tokyo, Japan.
This is my blog, the area for my own musings! I write about the books I read,
the code I write, the articles, videos and podcasts I find on the Internet, and
about experiences that I have in Japan and elsewhere that I think are
interesting!

I wrote at [various
places](https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/writing/technology/wordpress/jekyll/programming/2017/03/26/day-37/)
before settling on this setup. Like a true content creator, I wrote a [blog
post](https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/writing/technology/wordpress/jekyll/programming/2017/03/26/day-37/)
even about that.

I love Node.js, Golang and Docker. I have been tinkering around with the latter
2 quite a lot lately, and it has been a humbling experience. Both are extremely
complicated software that are not anything less than magic, when used as
intended. I have done some backend development in the MEAN stack till now. I
have also worked with Python, Ruby, PHP and Golang over the years as I work on
open source projects.

Vim, tmux, git and Firefox are the major parts of my daily setup!  Ubuntu is the
OS I have been using for the past few years. I have several gripes with it, but
it has to do for now. I have Windows too, but I mostly use it to play NFS Hot
Pursuit. That game has worked on every Windows PC I have tried to run it on,
and it's a no-bells-and-whistles racing game. I have stuck with it for a few
years, and probably will for a few more!

Check out my open-source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/icyflame). Check
out my NPM modules at [NPM](https://npmjs.org/~icyflame). I watch too many TV
series and incessantly talk about them on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/_icyflame).
