_This is part 2 of a two part series_

[Part 1][5] &middot; [Part 2][6]

As promised at the end of Part 1, I will list the number of people who were
affected by these incidents that were heavily reported on in the Indian news
media to the point where I was actually wondering whether it was even safe to
travel in the Railways anymore. If I had only had a look at the numbers I am
going to show you, I would never have had that fear.

The full data can be found [here][4].
The sources are listed at the end of this post.

First, let's look at the list of deaths and injuries over a period of 5 years
starting 2010 and ending 2017.

**YEAR** | **DEATHS** | **INJURIES**
:---: | :---: | :---:
2010 | 222 | 464
2011 | 128 | 540
2012 | 94 | 89
2013 | 75 | 81
2014 | 69 | 181
2015 | 110 | 420
2016 | 153 | 382
2017 | 67 | 360
**TOTAL** | 918 | 2517

That's less than a thousand deaths and about 2500 injuries over a period of 8
years. _Including_ the year in which there were so many reports about
derailments and problems. How dangerous is travelling in the Indian Railways?
One number will reassure you.

Every year, Indian Railways carries more than [8 billion passengers][1]. Out of them,
in their worst year, 222 people died. That's an incredibly small number.

For comparison, [WHO estimated][2] in 2013 that about 207,000 people die each
year because of road accidents in India. Put another way, an estimated [17
people die][3] among 100,000 inhabitants each year. That is way way more than
the total number of people who die in railway accidents.

So, trains are far safer than road travel. And air travel just had the safest
year, last year. So, flights are safer than trains. There's no need to feel
panicked by the numbers that are being shown on TV every time a train derails.

Every step should be taken to bring this number down to zero. But realize that
this is a safe mode of transport. That's the take-away here.

***

My argument is that these numbers should have been part of every single story on
TV about this topic. Isolated numbers make no sense to a viewer. When you show
them the same numbers with context and a total that they can divide it by, they
will realize how important the number is. I probably don't need to explain this,
but I want to be sure I am understood here. Say there is a fictional elevator
and you want to find out how dangerous it is to get on it. You know this:

_On average, 2 people have gotten injured every single week for the past 8 weeks_

Now, if the elevator is used by only 10 people in a week, that's very alarming.
You should probably not get on the elevator and take the stairs.

But if it's a big building where several people work and it's used nearly
100,000 times or more, you don't need to worry.

In either case, it's very important that you find the problem and fix it. But
institutions tend not to be very fast about solving some problems that are
logistically complicated. In that case, you need to be able to make a realistic
estimate of the danger you will be in when you make a decision. To do that, you
need all the facts.

So, everyone who reports news, please please please mention the context next
time you report a number. Mention the total, compare it to a similar number,
help your audience understand the number you are reporting. You are doing a job
that's more important than the ratings your show gets.

**P.S.** Do watch the TV show [The Newsroom
(2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1870479/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). It's a really
great story about what the business of reporting news is really about.
