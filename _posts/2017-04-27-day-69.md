This is one of the posts that I hope to be proud of when I am done with this 100
days of writing marathon.

For a long time, moods and music have been closely connected. I think
temperatures are too. Stay with me.

On a hot summer day (hot is about 35-40 degrees celsius, here in India),
listening to an Arctic Monkeys song that is racing through is hard. I might
listen to it for a bit, but I eventually end up feeling _hot_. Especially, songs
from Favourite Worst Nightmare. The best example is If You Were There, Beware.

The songs starts out slightly less heavier than it gets, which makes it a bit
more enticing.

Whereas, now compare it to the following two songs. They instantly make you feel
light and cold.

All Lana Del Rey songs seem to induce a laid-back, let's sleep this one out
attitude on the listener. I first binged on Summertime Sadness for a whole month
in the Summer of 2014. I hadn't heard any of her other songs then, but that one
song that I heard and it's video was enough to put me through May 2014, in
temperatures that were way over 40 degrees in Kharagpur. Listening to it now, I
feel like that song was incredibly "_hot_" and there was definitely something
off with me for having heard it and liked it in the summer.

**Bonus fact:** I had no clue what Summertime Sadness was, when I first heard
the song. I liked the lyrics though, they were poetic and each sentence merged
into the other. That is a feeling I have about Lana's music even today. (She
released a single a few days back.) Now that I know what it means, the video
makes a lot more sense. It builds up to the climax that I didn't understand
before.

There are some songs I couldn't quite figure out, though.

It's probably because these songs don't really have any unique "temperature" to
them. They are cold-blooded, they adapt to the temperature their listener is in.
That's a pretty cool analogy, I feel. But, who am I, really?

P.S. (to a post that I was hoping would be great but turned out to be slightly
above average): I have been meaning to do a chronological music catalogue in
which I list what all artists, bands and people making music I love. Something
that I could look back on 10 years from now and reflect at how mature / immature
/ misled I was, at this point in my life.

I would give anything to have a Year In Review video for every single year of my
life. Something that is incredibly fast paced and basically a clone of [this
Casey Neistat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=633rwYgYJDs).
