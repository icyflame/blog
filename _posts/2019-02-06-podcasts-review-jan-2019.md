Happy New Year! Let's jump right in!

* **This American Life** - **The Walls** - **5/5**

    A fascinating episode! This American Life is one of those podcasts that I
    listen to rarely, but every time I do I end up with an episode that is
    absolute gold! This episode came out at the top of the "Trump shut down the
    government for a wall" news story and debates some of the amazing walls
    around the world. The conclusion is simple: _Walls make us feel safe_,
    irrespective of how big they are, whether there's another wall on the other
    side of the wall on _our_ side, whether it actually even exists or has been
    conjured out of nowhere just to pacify us. This episode also follows the
    story of a man who has lived all his life with a wall in his home country; A
    wall that has made his relatives strangers to him and how he reconciles with
    that. _Once a wall is built, it becomes a fact of life and affects the way
    life is lived around it_ When put like that, we really see how much power
    walls have! An absolutely amazing episode!

* **The Slow Burn** - **Season 1: Watergate**

    The Watergate scandal is something that was shrouded in a lot of mystery
    for me before I heard the first season of this podcast. The scandal is
    mentioned so often no matter which country's news channel you turn on. It's
    this daring attempt at covering up something that so many people knew that
    anyone who must have looked at it from the outside, in the aftermath, would
    have said: "AH! That could never have been kept under wraps" and yet the
    truth is, that it _was_ kept under wraps for quite a long time. Listening to
    this podcast really makes you think about what would be discussed as
    _history_ 50 years from now when other people are analyzing the choices that
    were made by us. A rivetting story that tries to get to the scandal from as
    many angles as possible!

* **Modern Love** - **What The Sea Took Away**

    This episode talks about how to deal with loss, loss that is inexplicable.
    Loss that doesn't come with the elusive concept of _eventual closure_.

* **Modern Love** - **A Young Man's Game**

    An episode about how bearing children is a young man's game. It's funny and
    evocative. One of the quotes that stayed with me after I finished listening
    to the episode: "I traveled and I wrote books, and I loved that life.  But I
    truly regret that Larkin hasn't gotten to know to know my mother, other than
    through our stories"

* **Modern Love** - **How To Break Up With a 2 Year-old**

    Another amazing Modern Love episode! I have really been sucked into this
    podcast, it's amazing essays and narations! This episode is about how babies
    attach so easily and so effortlessly with adults and even as they grow up to
    forget these adults and how important they were to them as babies, the
    adults keep getting older and realizing more and more how insignificant a
    part they were of this young human being's life! Heart warming and heart
    breaking, in just a few paragraphs. If you can't listen to the episode,
    definitely read the [essay][1].
