title: Day 27 - MISSED; Some python and regex written for Gyft

ARGH! I missed yesterday. It wasn't even too tiring a day or anything, anyway, I
am going to make the best of this. I am about 8 hours later than when the usual
post should have been.

I have not been writing a lot of code, and I hadn't submitted a pull request in
almost 20 days! _That's unacceptable, Jimmy, UNACCEPTABLE._

I decided to remedy that situation today. Gyft is a set of python scripts which
lets you login into your IIT Kharagpur ERP account, get your timetable for the
semester from there. Before my patch, the only option was to put this timetable
into your Google Calendar. You generate a `client_secret` file and give the
python script access to add recurring events to your calendar. It didn't sound
right to me, and it was pretty cumbersome to use as well.

So, I wanted to enable exporting the calendar to ICS files. ICS files are
amazing! Every major calendar application supports them, they are apt for static
calendars like a Semester timetable. I had this idea in [August
2016](https://github.com/icyflame/gyft/commit/4bf76fd2633870f274a1b952ea66abac63339fb9),
I opened [the issue](https://github.com/metakgp/gyft/issues/24) in December 2016. 
Since, it has just been vegetating because I wasn't working on it, and the
whole Gyft repository has been [rather
inactive](https://github.com/metakgp/gyft/graphs/commit-activity) since.

The first part of the patch that I had implemented already was the relatively
time-consuming part. It had a function which would build an event given the
[appropriate
parameters](https://github.com/icyflame/gyft/commit/4bf76fd2633870f274a1b952ea66abac63339fb9#diff-b284a28710cce90d9d9be3a7f4cabc8eR9)
like start time, end time, etc.

The second part of this patch was to merge this with the parsing code that is
there inside the `add_events.py` script. It takes the data from the `data.txt`
file (which is taken from the ERP) and parses that into event information.

Here comes the Regular Expressions part. The old parsing was done with
a complicated [string parsing mechanism](https://github.com/metakgp/gyft/blob/bf3c2614d8508706f30bedca9419b6bf3dac2e33/add_events.py#L88-L129).
Frankly, I couldn't understand what was being done, and I took a step back and
analysed the string that we do want to parse. It looks something like this:

```sh
10:0:AM-10:55:AM
```

I realised that this was the best place to use Regular Expressions! A couple of
minutes in the Python shell led me to this regular expression:

```sh
TIMETABLE_DICT_RE ='([0-9]{1,2}):([0-9]{1,2}):([AP])M-([0-9]{1,2}):([0-9]{1,2}):([AP])M'
```

This Regex is clearly not optimal, there is no need to repeat the same Regular
Expression twice. Having it only once, should be enough. I should implement
that!

But barring that, it worked out pretty well. The new parsing code which is part
of the new `generate_ics.py` script was
[smaller](https://github.com/icyflame/gyft/blob/3e761cd3e2017ee2d876819df401df9dc791b24d/generate_ics.py#L89-L95)
and also returned a `datetime` object instead of trying to write the complete
iCalendar event as per the [RFC (IETF RFC 5545)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545).

Eventually, [this pull request](https://github.com/metakgp/gyft/pull/32)
came out of my work today! I am awaiting reviews
on the pull request, and it should get merged soon. I have already generated an
ICS and added it to my Google Calendar! It looks good!
