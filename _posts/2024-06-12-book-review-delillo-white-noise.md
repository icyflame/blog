categories: book-review capitalism humor

**Rating:** 5/5

What if a novel was **very** funny? If every single sentence that came out of the protagonist's mouth,
only served to make him look progressively less important and more foolish than you thought?  What
if it was the author mocking the protagonist privately to the reader, without letting the
protagonist in on the joke? **That** would be a great novel, and _White Noise_ fits the bill. The
protagonist is a man who walks around a college in long robes and dark glasses, because it makes him
look important and unapproachable, because it gives him authority. He continues this pretense in his
thoughts as well. The chaotic misinformation rallies that go around in the back of his car, as
everyone is talking over each other, and no one is answering the question which sparked the
conversation, are a treat to read. The level of ignorance is deliberately exaggerated to a comic
level. I can't wait to watch the movie adaptation. Meanwhile, here's a review of the book.

I present this (unnecessarily) long thought that is ricocheting around the protagonist's
phenomenally empty mind:

> The kitchen and the bedroom are the major chambers around here, the power haunts, the sources. She
> and I are alike in this, that we regard the rest of the house as storage space for furniture, toys,
> all the unused objects of earlier marriages and different sets of children, the gifts of lost
> in-laws, the hand-me-downs and rummages. Things, boxes. Why do these possessions carry such
> sorrowful weight? There is a darkness attached to them, a foreboding. They make me wary not of
> personal failure and defeat but of something more general, something large in scope and content.

When he wants to describe something, the best the protagonist can come up with is "something more
general, something large in scope and content." It is DeLillo's skill that we do not see this as
bad or lazy writing, but as the character's inability to come up with anything really insightful. It
is not much of a comfort that the protagonist spends almost the whole book in this illusion: that he
is saying something profound, when what he is actually saying is most banal. That is to say, the
whole book is incredibly entertaining. He uses this "something" technique in one other memorable
occasion:

> In the morning I walked to the bank. I went to the automated teller machine to check my balance. I
> inserted my card, entered my secret code, tapped out my request. The figure on the screen roughly
> corresponded to my independent estimate, feebly arrived at after long searches through documents,
> tormented arithmetic. Waves of relief and gratitude flowed over me. The system had blessed my
> life. I felt its support and approval. The system hardware, the mainframe sitting in a locked room
> in some distant city. What a pleasing interaction. I sensed that something of deep personal value,
> but not money, not that at all, had been authenticated and confirmed. A deranged person was escorted
> from the bank by two armed guards. The system was invisible, which made it all the more impressive,
> all the more disquieting to deal with. But we were in accord, at least for now. The networks, the
> circuits, the streams, the harmonies.

The various characters are the main reason I remained interested in getting to the end of the
book. The ending is not a satisfying one; it does not tie anything up; I guess that is predictable
because the story never ends (because consumerism itself has no end).

First, there is the protagonist Jack Gladney. I have poked fun at him already. His "brain noise" is
peppered throughout the book. And the story goes in some bizarre directions. He is the anchor among
all the strange twists and turns (some of which **are** boring). He remains locked into a mind numbing
set of car rides between his house, the college where he works, and the store. Every time he goes to
the store, he buys things he does not need. Whenever he is at home, is throwing away things that he
does not need. He is a symbol: A symbol of the mindlessness that the corporations expect from
everyone, perhaps? There is one final thing that he does which I must mention. While talking with
his wife Babette, he says:

> "We're going to come through this thing all right," I said. "Maybe stronger than ever. We're
> determined to be well. Babette is not a neurotic person. She is strong, healthy, outgoing,
> affirmative. She says yes to things. This is the point of Babette."

The most present character is one of the professors at the college, Murray. He is studying "American
environments." And is constantly talking about the "data" being strong in the grocery store. He is a
first class weirdo, but somehow he is the only one Gladney trusts and talks with and really
believes. On multiple occasions what Murray tells him about something surfaces during another
conversation or in another situation. Murray might well be the author's stand-in: Always at the
ready to explain things that we (Gladney is the naive reader's stand-in?) don't understand. Here is
a classic:

> "This is the nature of modern death," Murray said. "It has a life independent of us. It is growing
> in prestige and dimension. It has a sweep it never had before. We study it objectively. We can
> predict its appearance, trace its path in the body. We can take cross-section pictures of it, tape
> its tremors and waves. We've never been so close to it, so familiar with its habits and
> attitudes. We know it intimately. But it continues to grow, to acquire breadth and scope, new
> outlets, new passages and means. The more we learn, the more it grows. Is this some law of physics?
> Every advance in knowledge and technique is matched by a new kind of death, a new strain. Death
> adapts, like a viral agent.

Heinrich is one of the kids in Gladney's house. He, Heinrich, is Gladney's son from a previous
marriage, and his mother has joined a cult as their accountant. Heinrich is constantly the most
interesting and the most confusing of all the characters: He talks about the looming ominous thing
when there is a manmade disaster near Gladney's house and he really shines during this time: He
spreads all kinds of doubts, speculation, and theories about what is going on and is very
authoritative about it. He asks Gladney questions that throw him off his studied center; these
questions dethrone him from the pedestal of authority which Gladney maintains at the college by
wearing his robe and dark glasses. At home, he is vulnerable to Heinrich's probing.

Babette speaks the least. She only has one really long conversation with Gladney. And she goes
through it matter-of-factly, without revealing much about herself. She remains the most mysterious
until the end; even though she is being seen and assessed and commented upon by everyone else, she
never has her own voice. I have a lingering feeling that she wanted to escape, and that she was one
of the saner ones in the house looking for an escape actively, rather than lamenting the apparent
lack of one as Gladney is or studying this condition as Murray was.

> That night, a Friday, we gathered in front of the set, as was the custom and the rule, with take-out
> Chinese. There were floods, earthquakes, mud slides, erupting volcanoes. We'd never before been so
> attentive to our duty, our Friday assembly. Heinrich was not sullen, I was not bored. Steffie,
> brought close to tears by a sitcom husband arguing with his wife, appeared totally absorbed in these
> documentary clips of calamity and death. Babette tried to switch to a comedy series about a group of
> racially mixed kids who build their own communications satellite. She was startled by the force of
> our objection. We were otherwise silent, watching houses slide into the ocean, whole villages
> crackle and ignite in a mass of advancing lava. Every disaster made us wish for more, for something
> bigger, grander, more sweeping.

The story is meandering, and this is not a novel that one would read for the story. One might read
it for its commentary on modern consumerism. One might read it simply because it is the funniest
book _ever._ To attempt a serious review of this book would be to dissect a great joke. A joke such
as this one:[^1]

> PLEASE NOTE. In several days, your new automated banking card will arrive in the mail. If it is a
> red card with a silver stripe, your secret code will be the same as it is now. If it is a green card
> with a gray stripe, you must appear at your branch, with your card, to devise a new secret
> code. Codes based on birthdays are popular. WARNING. Do not write down your code. Do not carry your
> code on your person. REMEMBER. You cannot access your account unless your code is entered
> properly. Know your code. Reveal your code to no one. Only your code allows you to enter the system.
