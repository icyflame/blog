A large number of articles, opinion pieces, blog posts, video essays, podcasts, television dramas,
and movies saturate the information landscape. It is bad form to say that there is more out there
than can be read by any one person. The dreaded information overload has arrived. A few acknowledge
the existence of this swarm of multimedia. The majority beckon an Algorithm, entrusting it with the
responsibility of collecting, filtering, and sorting them in the unknowable order that each
component particle of the majority expects. Opting out is futile. Not knowing about something is
superior to not knowing about its _occurrence._ What follows is a view of culture and society based
on the contents of 3 issues of the WIRED magazine.

Suggestions of openness are reduced to the realities of great coffee in the lobby in less than a
decade.

> Yet OpenAI _has_ changed. The nonprofit board might technically be in charge, but virtually everyone
> in the company is on the for-profit ledger. &#x2026; It's got product managers and engineers working
> constantly on updates to its products, and every couple of weeks it seems to ping reporters with
> demonstrations&#x2013;just like other product-oriented Big Tech companies. I have visited virtually every
> major tech company in Silicon Valley and beyond, and not one surpasses the coffee options in the
> lobby of OpenAI's headquarters in San Francisco.
>
> Not to mention: It's obvious that the "openness" embodied in the company's name has shifted from the
> radical transparency suggested at launch.

Product companies have a bright future, if they focus on engagement.

> Roblox Connect, then, is an attempt to get people to just &#x2026; hang out in Roblox, even when they're
> not gaming. Hanging out equals more engaged minutes; more engaged minutes leads to better
> advertising opportunities and "bookings," the purchase of virtual goods using Roblox's digital
> currency, Robux.

&#x2026; and if that engagement is tied to _commercial information_.

> First of all, in search, people come looking for information. Over the past many years, you know,
> how we present that has dramatically evolved. But we are still trying to help people find the best
> information that exists online. Inherently, people are also looking for commercial information, and
> ads are very valuable commercial information, because they connect merchants and businesses, small
> and big, to users. None of that changes just because we are applying AI deeply. When we evolve
> search with generative AI, we'll apply the same principles. It's important to us to connect users
> with what's out on the web, and we are working deeply to make sure that continues to work
> well. &#x2026; We want to make sure users are consuming those sites. So I don't think the core part of
> the experience will change. We will have a space for ads in a way that makes sense for users and
> particularly on commercial queries

Creation myths allow protagonists to enter closed restaurants and make small talk with staff after
they were _dropped off_.

> I arrived at a restaurant to meet Moore and tugged at the door. Locked&#x2013;it was one minute before
> opening. &#x2026; When the hostess let me in, I gave her the reservation name. "The other guest is
> already seated," she said. &#x2026; That was impossible. The restaurant wasn't open yet. &#x2026; "She's been
> here awhile," she explained. &#x2026; She'd been dropped off earlier and passed the time by making
> conversation with the staff.

Definitions are changing.

Podcast-ready essays read by AI-generated voices.

> The 19-year-old speaks in the confident, podcast-ready tone of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who
> sees the world in terms of problems to be solved, ending every other sentence with, "Right?"
> Listening to him wax on about defensible moats and the "S-curve" of societal growth, it's easy to
> forget he can't legally drink. But then, occasionally, he'll say something that reveals the
> wide-eyed undergrad, open to the world and still figuring out his place in it. Like the time he and
> a friend walked around the Santa Monica pier until 3 am, "talking about what we value." Semrai
> thinks a lot about how to find balance and happiness. "I think, while I'm young, it probably lies
> more in exploring the derivative," he says, "chasing the highs and lows."

Profit still matters.

The masters spoke. They said, "AGI is not on the way." No one was listening.

> Now, Microsoft has an exclusive license to commercialize OpenAI's tech. And OpenAI also has
> committed to use Microsoft's cloud exclusively. In other words, without even taking its cut of
> OpenAI's profits (reportedly Microsoft gets 75 percent until its investment is paid back), Microsoft
> gets to lock in one of the world's most desirable new customers for its Azure web services. With
> those rewards in sight, Microsoft wasn't even bothered by the clause that demands reconsideration if
> OpenAI achieves general artificial intelligence, whatever that is. "At that point," [says Nadella,](https://www.wired.com/story/microsofts-satya-nadella-is-betting-everything-on-ai/)
> "all bets are off." It might be the last invention of humanity, he notes, so we might have bigger

The optimists have abandoned ship.

> "Artificial intelligence, cloning, genetic engineering, [virtual reality](https://www.wired.com/tag/vr/), [robots](https://www.wired.com/tag/robots/), nanotechnology,
> bio-hacking, space colonization, and autonomous machines are all likely coming, one way or
> another. But we must take a stand and insist that human values are folded into the development of
> each and every one of them." Only a few years later, here he is rejecting not just these
> technologies, but technology writ large as a solution to our problems.

Humans communicate to win esoteric games that simulate a world without bureaucracy.

> This is the current Diplomacy metagame. Game theory calculations undergird most utterances, and even
> humans communicate in code. Lerer joked that in modern-day online Diplomacy, even human players
> wouldn't pass the Turing test. Before Cicero, it seems, humans had already started playing like
> AIs. Perhaps, for an AI to win at Diplomacy, Diplomacy had to become a less human game.

Writing is still hard for the writers (apparently).

> According to Thomas Mann, "A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for

Some things have not changed.

> It's a subtle but meaningful distinction: Human writing may not be better, or more creative, or even
> more original. But it will be human, which will matter to other humans.
