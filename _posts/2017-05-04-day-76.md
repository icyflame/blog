title: Day 76 - I have nothing to write about
categories: 100daysofwriting nothing
---

I have been staring at an empty markdown file for the past 10 minutes. The
difference between going to college and working a day job is that you are at
your day job for 8 hours a day. Then, you come home to have dinner and chill.
There's no other time to read something or find something that is actually worth
writing about. I must inevitably fall back on some of my reserve, can always
write about topics.

Now, after 75 days of (almost) daily, (certainly) regular writing, that list of
topics stands at `[ ]`: an empty list. My last post was about nothing, the post
before that was about a book I read and quotes from that book, so I didn't
effectively do anything except read the book and read the parts I marked in the
book again.

**POST #76 is OVER**
