I don't really know what to write about. It's been about 15 minutes since I
opened this file and edited the header. No idea has really occurred to me, yet.

The next issue on Github that I am going to target is the `subjects.json`
inconsistency that is bound to happen between all Metakgp repositories.

Basically, `subjects.json` is meant to be a JSON file that maps subject courses
offered in IIT Kharagpur to the name of the subject. Right now, there's a JSON
file that's used. I can't be sure that the same version of the file is used in
these projects: [mfqp-source](https://github.com/metakgp/mfqp-source), 
[gyft](https://github.com/metakgp/gyft). These are the only two projects I can
find which use this file, I was convinced before that more projects used it!
Probably because people have often asked me for that file, and used it to some
other end.

Anyway, submodules would solve this problem entirely. Must work on that.

_Still struggling to find something to write words about_

I am going to have to end this here, it seems. This will definitely be my
shortest post till now. I will strive to do better tomorrow!
