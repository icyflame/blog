I have been rewatching Homeland episodes. Season 1, starting right from the
pilot. I can't get enough of Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin before they became
infinitely more matured and started handling actual, credible threats instead of
gut feelings about someone who is off.

Those are the last few moments of Homeland 1.4: Semper I. Carrie just met Brody
for the first time alone. Her smile says a lot here, she was struck by him right
from the first time they met. I never noticed the subtlety with which these
episodes were shot.

They way being a voyeur into Brody's life made her feel bad, but she watched
anyway because she still believed that even in those moments he might give
something essential away. That quality stayed with her through 5 seasons. She
watches Quinn's painful video several hundred times, until she finds the tile
design that eventually leads to them finding him.

It's surprisingly how less their character traits have all changed, having
a constant set of writers makes a huge difference in the continuity that a show
maintains. Changing writers will always change the style of a show, and viewers
**will** give up. Alex Gansa has done Homeland justice.

Do I think Homeland should end soon? Well, I don't see any reason for them to
end it. The story hasn't gotten repetitive yet, they are still coming up with
new plot points and insane insane twists that can't be seen despite 5 seasons of
material.

Did Quinn have a good exit from the show? HELL YEAH. I am sure Rupert will be
back in past sequences in the next season, it's a good old trick to keep the
transition from Rupert to no-Rupert smooth. I am glad for that, but his
character had become something that had only two goals, like one Reddit user
aptly summarised it. "He has to get together with Carrie now, or die. I don't
see them killing him after this much groundwork that went into his character and
building him to this point." That served as a source of hope and inspiration,
until the episode released. He had a good exit. Rupert Friend will return as
another different character somewhere else, I am sure. I shall wait eagerly for
that.
