## Review

This book is everything that it claims to be on the book jacket. It "uncovers
the inner workings of the institutions behind these economic manipulations". In
particular, it looks at some of the _incredibly_ global institutions that are
name dropped in a lot of contexts: World Bank, International Monetary Fund and
the World Trade Organization. There are several stories here about loans that
were given to countries which were supposed to build schools or upgrade the city
hall building of a bustling city or one of a myriad of other reasons but never
did that or help the people the money was supposed to help in any way.

I must admit that it was a pretty shocking revelation at several points. In
particular, we get stories from the people in the field, the rank and file of
organizations like the World Bank who are going abroad to assess if a given loan
should be sanctioned or a banker who used to work in an island that was being
used for offshore banking.

They tell stories about how their job affected the places that they were working
in or the places they went to in Africa (this book focuses a lot on some
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa) or about the ways in which the management and
people above them were basically apathetic to the consequences of the things
that their jobs were enabling. These stories are all backed up with actual data
from reports or news articles which show the outcomes of the things that are
discussed.

I particularly liked that the book doesn't work as a list of testimonials where
the reader is simply supposed to believe the people who are telling the story
and the editor and not really question where they got their data. This was a
refreshing non-fiction book about global economics, in that sense.

I learnt a lot of things about the global economy. The chapter on offshore
banking in Jersey, Englang, the chapter on exploitation of the Iraqi people and
government in the name of "Production Sharing Agreements", the chapter about the
strange policies that were implemented in Philippines despite continued
realizations at different levels of the heirarchy that whatever they were doing
was simply not working.

The most important insights for me came in the 11th Chapter by James S. Henry,
The Mirage of Debt Relief. This chapter really shook me and my assumptions about
national debt. I didn't know much about national debt before I started reading
the book, but my belief was that having high foreign debt was quite common in
most economies and that it wasn't really something to think much about because
"banks and governments don't default on loans"! This assumption of mine was
_completely_ blown out of the water by the things that Henry shows in this
chapter.

### On the Debt/Capital Flight cycle

Debt goes to the Finance ministry of a government with no oversight or
accountability to the tax payer.

- This capital is either wasted on projects that are intentionally priced above
  the market rate or is fleeced by the people inside the government or
  companies with close ties to people high up in the government who are
  supposedly working on "development projects"
- The fleeced capital is moved out of the country through a web of offshore
  investments contributing to capital flight. This is powered by clever,
  high priced lawyers and bankers who are working on islands like Jersey,
  England (a previous chapter)
- The country is left holding the bag: An unproductive loan that taxpayers have
  to pay interest on as debt service, each year. The principal will almost
  certainly not be paid for several years.

The existence of this cycle might appear to be _semi-obvious_ if you have
followed the trajectory of some countries and their economies: They get huge
loans from the World Bank or from a group of foreign lenders, but the money
never ends up making any difference. Eventually, the country gets a follow-up
loan or everyone gives up on the country's economy. _Corruption and transparency
issues_ are pegged as the root cause of this problem.

Here's the sitch: The debt-based development model doesn't work when it comes to
low-middle income countries where the government is a weak institution and
almost always over-run by corruption.

The World Bank model of neo-liberalism peddles the "free-market" as the silver
bullet which is going to solve all the problems that plague the lower income
economies of the world. But the problem with this model is that it is focused on
lending to the government, reducing the government's role in the economy,
bringing in private players for local services and foreign investment for new
industries, effectively reducing the government to a license-issuing institution
with no real power to set policy or even the minimum wage that should be paid to
citizens or even control the amount of local labor that must be used for a given
project.

In search of the free-market, the government has just accepted World Bank advise
and reduced it's own role and made itself weaker. This makes it even more
simpler for corrupt individuals to take over the government and fleece future
and past loans even more efficiently! This kicks off the cycle which leads to a
small elite who control the government, are extremely rich, keep their assets
safely in First World economies in offshore investments, thus ensuring that
anyone that the loan was originally meant for will never benefit from it.

### Export Credit Agencies

The list of projects that were funded by ECAs from across the First World is
quite long and each project has it's own problems. As the author of this chapter
(chapter 10), Bruce Rich, introduces a lot of issues with ECAs: Lack of
oversight, lack of accountability to the tax payer even though they can enjoy
the benefits of tax money and the government's clout, an impenetrable curtain of
secrecy that ensures that they don't _even_ have to publish the list of projects
that they approved and funded! The author uses a phrase that can be used in
several situations including while describing the development that was supposed
to come from the huge loans that have been sanctioned over the past few years to
the lower income countries:

> perpetually around the corner

There are some important numbers and a little bit of discussion about why China,
India and Korea had some structural, geographical and political advantages and
thus were able to mostly ignore advise from the IMF and outright reject the
neo-liberalism that is being peddled as the "road to development".

I could not find anything problematic about the book. The sources are extensive
and most of the facts that are not _just_ personal experiences are backed up
with official sources. My reading list after reading this book has a couple of
papers about ECAs and how economists in the First World view them. The one thing
that might threw me at first was how old all the data was. Reading the
introduction gives some background on this, it appears as if this book has been
around for a while but wasn't published by anyone because no one wanted to touch
a book that was flaty critical about the _global economic system_ and what had
basically become a cartel of the richest countries bending loans and lower
income countries to their will.
