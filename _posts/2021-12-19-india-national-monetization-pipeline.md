title: India's National Monetization Pipeline

---

The National Monetisation Pipeline was a policy announced by the BJP government in India in
August 2021. This policy [was not widely covered](https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/what-is-asset-monetisation-know-about-governments-plan-to-raise-6-lakh-crore-1629810047-1) in any of the national newspapers, and there were [no
policy analyses](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/india-aims-to-raise-81-billion-by-leasing-infrastructure-assets) that went deeper than the headline numbers highlighted by the government. While some
articles started coming out in September with more details about the government's expectations, I
couldn't find any criticism of the government's approach. A tired [comparison to Australia's asset
monetisation plan](https://theprint.in/opinion/what-is-the-best-asset-monetisation-plan-modi-govt-can-learn-important-lessons-from-australia/721622/) was everywhere, but this did nothing but scratch the surface. (The same comparison
was repeated in multiple publications including The Print and India Today.) This post is a summary
of my understanding of the policy after reading [some detailed coverage](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/20210927-asset-monetisation-the-big-push-1853498-2021-09-17) in the September 27, 2021
issue of the India Today magazine.

This post is broken up into three sections: What, Why and How. I have included footnotes with
sources for all the figures that are mentioned in this post.


# What?

India's [National Monetization Pipeline (NMP)](https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2021-08/Vol_2_NATIONAL_MONETISATION_PIPELINE_23_Aug_2021.pdf) was unveiled by the government in the last week of
August 2021. It is a policy that aims to raise Rs. 6 lakh crores[^1] over the 4 years between 2021
and 2025.

The pipeline plans to put up existing, operational government-owned assets for monetisation. Private
companies can get "revenue rights" to these assets, which will enable them to enhance them (such as
widening operational roads) and provide new services using them (such as new trains on existing
railway tracks). The ownership of the assets will remain with the government. And when the tenure of
monetisation ends, revenue rights will revert to the government. In effect, the government is
leasing out its assets to private players.

The question for private players who are considering any investment is clear:

1.  Can they use the asset to generate enough revenue to recoup the capital that they invest?
2.  If they can recoup the capital, can they make a profit on the asset in the limited time for which
    they will hold the revenue rights?


## Government's expectations

For assets that are monetised, the government expects the following three things from the private
sector entity:

1.  Upfront capital
2.  A share of revenue generated from the asset during the period of monetisation
3.  Investment commitment towards the monetised asset

The government expects the private player to increase efficiency, enhance the quality of service,
and increase userbase through service improvements, so that they can charge enough to make money
despite having to pay a share of their revenue back to the government. In reality, most private
players that will monetise an asset will probably use all three strategies.


## Connection to National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)

[NIP](https://indiainvestmentgrid.gov.in/national-infrastructure-pipeline) is the flagship policy that the Indian government unveiled on August 15, 2019 (India's
Independency Day). This policy's goal was to invest Rs. 100 lakh crores into infrastructure projects
in India during the period from 2019 to 2025. This policy is planned to end at the same time as the
NMP.

NMP is one of the ways in which the government is raising money to invest in the NIP. (The
government's revenues from NMP will be re-invested in "new infrastructure" that will be built as
part of NIP.)

The NIP's headline number was _ambitious_. The total infrastructure investment in India in the
preceding 5 year period from 2013 to 2018 was Rs. 46.48 lakh crores, according to the [Department of
Economic Affairs (DEA)](https://www.dea.gov.in/sites/default/files/Report%20of%20the%20Task%20Force%20National%20Infrastructure%20Pipeline%20(NIP)%20-%20volume-i_1.pdf).[^2] In effect, Modi's plan was to double infrastructure investment.

Surprisingly, I could not find any summary of how this policy is going after 2019. The [official
policy document](https://www.dea.gov.in/sites/default/files/Report%20of%20the%20Task%20Force%20National%20Infrastructure%20Pipeline%20(NIP)%20-%20volume-i_1.pdf) marks several of the important Key Performance Indicators as "TBD (To Be Decided)."
The [latest mention of this policy](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/budget-2021-national-infrastructure-pipeline-expanded-to-cover-7400-projects) was in the Budget speech in February 2021 where new projects were
added to NIP.  It is already 2 years since the policy's implementation period began, but there seems
to be no mention of it anywhere on Government websites or any media coverage of how much investment
has come in through this policy and whether the government is meeting its phasing goals for the
project.

My read of the numbers is that the government is falling short of the capital expenditure
planned under the NIP:

| Period  | Planned CapEx from Centre under NIP[^3] | CapEx as in Budget 2021-22[^4] | Percentage of CapEx achieved |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 2019-20 | 5.62 lakh cr.                              | 3.35 lakh cr.[^5]              | 59.60%                       |
| 2020-21 | 8.39 lakh cr.                              | 4.39 lakh cr.[^6]              | 52.32%                       |
| 2021-22 | 8.31 lakh cr.                              | 5.54 lakh cr.[^7]              | 66.66%                       |


## Comparing Expected Revenue

To put this number in context, here are some headline figures for the Indian economy. All figures in
the second column are in lakh crore INR (= 1 trillion INR). The figures for government revenue and
expenditure are from the "Actual" values of 2019-20, the last year which has published "Actuals"
figures and was not affected by the Covid19 pandemic. Figures are taken from the [PRS India Union
Budget analysis](https://prsindia.org/budgets/parliament/union-budget-2021-22-analysis).

So, the government's peak yearly revenue from NMP would cover the government's expenditure on
Education and Railways. Looking at these figures, it's clear that the NMP is not as ambitious as the
NIP.


# Why?

There seem to be two major reasons for this policy:

1.  **Public sector management of public assets is inefficient:** This is tacitly accepted
    throughout the NMP policy document, especially in sections where the policy talks about
    "unlocking value" in existing assets. The government recognizes that efficient management of
    public assets is essential to the economy's growth. However, to achieve this, the management is
    outsourced to private players.
2.  **Government borrowing is at a limit:** For the NIP, the government must raise Rs. 100 lakh crores
    in the 2020-2025 period. Until now, it seems that the main method for raising this capital has
    been government borrowing. (I could not find concrete figures for how much of the borrowing has
    gone into NIP projects.) The debt-to-GDP ratio is just above 62.9% in 2020-21. Moreover, over the
    remaining period of the NIP, until 2025, the government plans to bring this ratio down to 60%,
    according to the recommendations from the 15th Finance Commission. This means that the government
    has to pay back about Rs. 4.5 lakh cr.[^10] of the oustanding liabilities to achieve their
    debt-to-GDP ratio goal. So, more borrowing is not the solution to fill the gap in NIP
    capital. The government sees monetizing existing assets as the only viable option.

One thing jumped out at me after reading through the literature about both NMP and NIP. NMP's
underlying assumption is that the private sector is better at efficiently maintaining infrastructure
compared to the public sector. So, one is forced to question the government's wisdom in trying to
build more public infrastructure under the NIP, which will be managed by the public sector, while it
is accepting that public sector management is inefficient in the long-run.


# How?

Details about the implementation of this policy are completely missing from the original policy
document. Most [media coverage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/india-aims-to-raise-81-billion-by-leasing-infrastructure-assets) about the NMP simply skips covering this part, because there is
nothing to be said.

Firstly, the details that are missing are: what kind of rights will be part of "revenue rights," how
much upfront capital and revenue share the government will demand for each type of asset. One has to
assume that these numbers will never be set in stone, because the private sector will expect them to
be negotiable based on their existing scale. They will also hope to get a "wholesale" discount, if
they decide to invest big in NMP. The government would not want to tie its hands during these
negotiations by publicly announcing a minimum value for any of these figures. So, the public will
probably find out about NMP projects only after the negotiations have been completed and the
government has already made a decision about these numbers.

Secondly, whether the private sector is even interested in taking over management of mismanaged
public assets, investing capital in them and trying to turn them around, is up for debate. There has
already been some criticism of the two major asset classes that are up for monetisation:

1.  **Roads:** Roads make up 27% of the expected revenue from NMP. 26,700 kms of roads that are
    operational or under construction with at least 4 lanes are up for monetisation. These roads are
    part of the National Highway network and the toll collection rights have been retained by the
    National Highway Authority of India. The criticism of this asset class is that 4-lane roads are
    already being managed efficiently by the NHAI, and that as long as toll collection rights remain
    with the NHAI, it seems unlikely that private players would want to put in any unrecoverable
    capital in the enhancement of this asset class. (As in the long term, NHAI will reap the benefits
    of the private player's capital investment.)
2.  **Railways:** Railways make up a further 26% of the expected revenue from NMP. 400 railway stations
    and 90 passenger train operations are up for monetisation. Currently, Konkan Railway seems to be
    the only railway entity in the country which has atleast one private stakeholder involved in its
    management. Given this relative lack of experience in the private sector, getting them involved
    in operations through asset monetisation seems akin to throwing them into the deep-end of the
    swimming pool. An approach in which entities that have experience managing operations can work
    with entities that don't have any experience in an effort to build the private sector's
    experience would be preferable. This approach would also give them a close look at the potential
    for profit in Railways operations.

---

Policies die in the implementation phase, where ambitious projects transform into reams of paperwork
making their way through an incompetent, circuitous and intolerably slow bureaucracy. Private sector
players are unable or unwilling to invest the resources required to cut through this regulatory red
tape. The very existence of the red tape will tilt the field towards a very small number of players,
and this policy might result in an oligarchy. This concern has been raised before, and the
government seems to be willing to accept the risk of oligarchy as long as they are able to get the
capital required to enact wider benefits. In a nod towards the influence of the reigning monopolists
in India (namely, [Ambani and Adani](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-12/two-billionaires-are-central-to-india-s-oversized-net-zero-ambitions)), [the leader of the opposition did not mention their name](https://youtu.be/lBXEFc0i4OE?t=913) in a
press conference in which he was criticizing the NMP. Instead, he chose to refer to them indirectly
as "2 or 3 people that you already know about."

With a goal of raising Rs. 0.88 lakh crore[^9] by April 2022 under the NMP, missing implementation
details raise questions about the government's ability to achieve their target.
