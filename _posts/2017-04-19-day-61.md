title: Day 61 - So, you think webcams can't be turned on without the indicator light?
categories: 100daysofwriting webcams security privacy online
---

2 days ago, I wrote [this
list](https://icyflame.github.io/blog/100daysofwriting/security/cryptography/lists/2017/04/17/day-59/)
about improving your security online and practices that you should follow. The
last point on that list was `Tape your webcam`. The question that most people
seem to have is:

1. Are there any existing exploits which can turn on your webcam without turning
   on the light that is there next to it? How widespread are these lights?

2. Why should I tape the webcam if I have nothing to hide? (This was the
   argument used by Shailene Woodley's character in the movie Snowden (2016)).

I think the FBI director Comey answered both these the best:

> I saw something in the news, so I copied it. I put a piece of tape — I have
> obviously a laptop, personal laptop — I put a piece of tape over the camera.
> Because I saw somebody smarter than I am had a piece of tape over their camera.

And what did he say about the second question?

> You go into any government office, we all have our little camera things that
> sit on top of the screen. They all have a little lid that closes down on them,
> You do that so that people who don’t have authority don’t look at you. I think
> that’s a good thing.

In light of all of that, I think my point about protecting your privacy because
the existence of exploits might be questioned but by the time that these
exploites are released to the public, it will most certainly be too late.

Moreover, if you know about the [Lower Merion School
District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbins_v._Lower_Merion_School_District)
case in which the School district gave laptops to all their students and
installed an anti-theft tracking software and used that to capture photos of
their students at periodic intervals. Most students noticed that the green light
next to their camera used to flash now and then, and they found it creepy but
the people at the school reassured them that it was a technical glitch (which is
the easiest out) and let it go. They paid heavily for their indiscretions and
SICK actions, it _must be_ noted though that the photos are out there and they
might have been deleted or handed over, nonetheless some people have seen it.

Further research for about 30-40 minutes on sites like the StackExchange site
for [Information Security](https://security.stackexchange.com/), Quora and news
websites led me to **several** articles that detailed exploits and attackers
getting access to webcams and using those to click pictures. There is a dearth
of articles in 2014 and 2015, which is intriguing, but 2013 was the time that
this issue was at it's highest popularity and there are many articles from the
second part of that year. So, _read on!_

    A Quora question with some surprisingly good answers about whether taping
    your webcam is something everyone should do

By this time, after reading all of that, I think you should be sufficiently
convinced about 1. the possibility of the existence of exploits 2. that someone
or the other is watching and it's not right to let them watch without your
permission.

On a sidenote, I didn't find those articles in the exact chronological order
that I have presented them in (obviously). After creating a list entry for each
of them, I had to sort them. I probably did using Quick Sort, because I
inherently created year pivots and grouped all of 2016's articles together, same
for 2015, 2013 and then once I had a clear distinction between these two sets, I
moved the whole 2013 before 2015 and so on. Probably not traditional quick sort
but I think that's the algorithm that comes closest to describing what I did.
