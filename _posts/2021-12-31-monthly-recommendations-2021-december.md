title: Monthly Recommendations (December 2021)
categories: monthly series reading
---

There is no specific theme for this month's recommendation list. It is an assortment of the articles
I read over the past year which had one thing in common: I wanted more people to read them and
decide what they thought about the underlying institutions and people that these articles
described. So, we have two articles about the tennis world: one about an athlete within the world
and another about the incentive structure of the sport; one article about a non-contrarian CEO with
some interesting ideas about running companies that he does not divulge, and another one about a
politician with new realizations that helped him confirm 3 nominees to the US Supreme Court even
though the confirmation of a single Supreme Court nominee was hailed as a big achievement just a few
years ago on [the TV Show, West Wing](https://youtu.be/m-qUfg6TjG8).

1.  **Naomi Osaka and tennis journalismâ€™s ugly history of demeaning its players (Abad-Santos)**

    [Vox](https://www.vox.com/22534957/naomi-osaka-french-open-wimbledon) ([archived](http://archive.today/2021.12.31-150413/https://www.vox.com/22534957/naomi-osaka-french-open-wimbledon)). 17 June, 2021.

     Naomi Osaka decided to take a break from tennis after she was fined for refusing to appear at
    post-match press conferences at the French Open. The moment she announced this was [included](https://youtu.be/EqboAI-Vk-U?t=31) in
    Google's Year In Search 2021 video. It was a major event in tennis; it was a major event in
    sports in general: A player decided to stop playing the sport because they could not deal with
    pressure from the journalists who cover that sport.

     I don't agree with the viewpoint of this article from Vox. Vox has been noticeably moving to the
    liberal left in the past year, especially since the departure of the two founders and more of the
    founding staff. This article seems to be another indication of this. Sports has **never** been just
    about the game that is being played. It has always been about the human element: People play
    these games and it is these people we are interested in, more than anything else. This was
    important for me in understanding the disgusting behavior of the spectators at the US Open 2018
    final between Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams who were [booing the victor](https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2018-09-08/naomi_osaka_derails_serena_williams_in_dramatic_final.html). If it was all about the
    sport, people would not be booing anyone because they got to see a good fight.

     If the athlete decides to just leave and not talk to anyone until they have had the chance to
    re-watch their performance and talk to their coaches/PR consultants to decide what they are going
    to say, the apparent "raw" element of sports is lost. This shift might not be a bad thing, but if
    this really does happen, the group of spectators will also change.

2.  **A Few Tennis Pros Make a Fortune. Most Barely Scrape By. (Steinberger)**

    [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/magazine/tennis-players-association.html) ([archived](http://archive.today/2021.07.05-082124/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/magazine/tennis-players-association.html)). 29 June, 2021.

     The incentive structure inside the professional tennis world is messed up. There are multiple
    tiers of competitions in which professionals early in their career must compete and win to get
    spots in the noticeable tournaments. These early tournaments are tiring and often played without
    any sponsorship. A player that does manage to travel and compete in these early tournaments will
    face the daunting task of defeating a well-rested seeded player in the more popular
    tournaments. This system is beneficial to players who have already made it and perhaps answers
    the question about why the established players from 10 years ago are still the established
    players of today (Nadal, Federer, Williams). The New Yorker published a [fictional take](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/futures) of the
    same problem, showing the state of a player who depends on benefactors to pay for his practice
    and travel, and develops a relationship with the donor's offspring.

3.  **These Chinese Millenials Are 'Chilling,' and Beijing Isn't Happy (Chen)**

    [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/03/world/asia/china-slackers-tangping.html) ([archived](http://archive.today/2021.07.10-061529/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/03/world/asia/china-slackers-tangping.html)). 3 July, 2021.

     Opting out of the rat race is not _just_ a personal choice in China. It is an interesting
    problem for a government to solve. Governments have been working to increase the workforce
    participation rate for several decades. But if they work their population too hard, the efforts
    are bound to boomerang and blow up in the government's faces. This is a good indication of what
    late-stage looks like in the socialism/capitalism hybrid that the Chinese economy is based
    on[^1]. We have already seen what late-stage socialism looks like in Europe with the
    pro-status-quo, anti-immigrant sentiment that has been growing over the past few years. In
    America, late-stage capitalism has manifested as dizzying inequality between executives and
    workers. India's capitalism-based economy seems to be heading towards the inequality
    scenario. Looking to other economies, identifying parallels, and trying to prevent them is a
    worthwhile exercise that policymakers seem uninterested to engage themselves in.

4.  **Does Palantir See Too Much? (Steinberger)**

    [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/21/magazine/palantir-alex-karp.html) ([archived](http://archive.today/2020.10.30-150748/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/21/magazine/palantir-alex-karp.html)). 21 Oct, 2020.

     The present is the time of the contrarian CEO. Just look at Elon Musk and his cavalier usage of
    his Twitter account to [poke fun at regulators](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-can-t-stop-taunting-the-sec) despite being burned before. This article is a
    profile of Palantir's founder Alex Karp. Karp is a contrarian CEO, who thrives on the mystery
    that he is able to generate. He is also non-conforming in the way that he runs the company. He
    talks about how the "team" is more important than everything else; which is similar to a lot of
    other software companies and not contrarian at all. But one of the advantages of his "let us
    maintain the mystery about Palantir" routine is that it makes it impossible to tell whether he is
    running the company in the standard fashion or if he is doing something truly contrarian. This
    article is a fun read simply due to the eccentric nature of the CEO. (Take for instance, his
    "inability to be norm-conforming and marry." Or his flight to Germany to study German and read
    the writers and thinkers he was drawn to in their mother tongue.) The way that Karp talks about
    himself and Palantir in this article makes it seem like a cult. This _might_ be the very effect
    that Karp is going for.

5.  **Enabler-in-Chief (Mayer)**

    [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/20/how-mitch-mcconnell-became-trumps-enabler-in-chief) ([archived](http://archive.today/2021.01.03-174602/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/20/how-mitch-mcconnell-became-trumps-enabler-in-chief)). 20 April, 2020.

     The American political system is ridden with veto points which can be exercised by [a single
    person](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/19/politics/joe-manchin-build-back-better/index.html). This also means that a single person who is able to keep their party's policymakers
    together in an unbreakable coalition is extremely valuable. Former Senate majority leader Mitch
    McConnell from the Republican party was just such a man. He was able to keep **all** the Senators
    from his party united towards a single goal, a staggering number of times during his 5-year term
    as the majority leader (since 2015). The one time that he had some doubt about whether he would
    be able to keep his caucus together was when Obama nominated a Supreme Court justice in his
    election year. On this occasion, McConnell decided to keep this from _even_ being voted on. Even
    during the last few chaotic weeks of the Trump presidency, McConnell managed to confirm 1 Supreme
    Court justice and prevent the impeachment in the "second impeachment trial" of Trump after (and
    despite) the [events of January 6, 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Capitol_attack). His understanding of the rules and procedures of the
    Senate were unparalleled. His realization that the electorate will blame the party in power for
    losses, even if they were caused due to a filibuster from the minority was genius and the key to
    most policy that did not go through the American system whenever the president is a
    Democrat. This article delves into the "McConnell" psyche by talking to people who worked
    alongside him and got a chance to look at how he makes decisions. The most memorable quote about
    McConnell, unfortunately, is one that shows a total lack of policy-making principles:

    > He [McConnell] never had any core principles. He just wants to be something. He doesn't want to
    > do anything.

Some policies that are included in this such as limits on for-profit education institutions are worth adopting in nearly every economy that wants to improve education opportunities for their citizenry. --- ![img](/public/img/monthly-recommendations-2021-12-something-else.jpg)
