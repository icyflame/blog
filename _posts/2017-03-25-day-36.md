title: Day 36 - Finding a solution to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS' "mouse not working" problem
categories: 100daysofwriting writing technology problems problem-solving
---

I am reading [Force and Opinion](https://chomsky.info/199107__/), an essay that
was posted on Metakgp Slack, when [I
posted](https://metakgp.slack.com/archives/C0AHUL0JE/p1490285875717038) my
surprise at having found the Internet Shutdowns in India. I am still reading it,
but it sounds like a solid thing to talk about in another post. I should
maintain a TODO list of topics that I want to talk about. (I am now switching to
Trello to create that list)

The mouse thing happened again. This Ubuntu was started only about 3 hours ago.
This is extremely frustrating, I don't want to go through the pain of
re-installing Ubuntu all over again with the right configuration and I don't
want to have to keep restarting the PC. That would defeat the whole purpose of
having a GOOD COMPUTER! I need to find a solution to this problem, RIGHT NOW.

AND FOUND IT!  [Restarting Laptop's USB PORTS WITHOUT restarting
computers](http://askubuntu.com/questions/178054/laptop-usb-ports-stop-working-how-to-restart-them-without-restarting-the-pc)
Yet another lesson in effective searching of the internet! I went through the
`dmesg -w` output right before the mouse stopped functioning and it didn't tell
me anything more than I already knew. Does it ring a bell?

The point 6937.288 is where the USB stopped functioning. See how the existing
mouse (connected as device 6) was disconnected and then reconnected as device
number 8. This lead me to think that _if only_ I could restart the USB module in
the kernel, it would detach and reattach ALL the USB devices. That would be the
best! I have my keyboard and the mouse connected on USB ports. A quick look at
the [AskUbuntu answer](http://askubuntu.com/a/178061/143446) and the `modprobe`
man page increased my confidence in the command posted there! So, this was the
solution I was looking for! This will go right next to my existing [restart
network
manager](https://github.com/icyflame/dotfiles/blob/3a7d96774d5995e80771c5f6d0f7cb61fccfd468/zsh/system_aliases.zsh#L1-L2)
alias in my dotfiles. GREAT, this solves a huge inconvenience. This happened
yesterday while I was watching a movie and wanted to download the subtitles for
that movie. It was an incredibly high and unexpected amount of pain. I didn't
anticipate that.

Okay, that has itself become a long post (probably because of the dmesg output
that I posted but it was totally necessary!) While I was writing that sentence,
it happened again (weirdly, the frequency seems to increase after fixing it
once. But frankly, I don't care now, I will just continue to run `modprobe`
while researching the problems that this could have. I can't think of any
really, adding and removing modules from the kernel is NOT that catastrophic
really.

Okay, I am really calling it here now.
