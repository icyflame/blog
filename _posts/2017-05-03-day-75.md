In the latest (April, actually) news, there are _a few more_ book to screen
adaptations that are scheduled to come out this year. Gillian Flynn's final
novel which hasn't been adapted yet, Sharp Objects, is coming out as a series on
HBO starring AMY ADAMS! After Arrival, she _probably_ needs to step up her game
to play the frontwoman.

More Stephen King with It and Dark Tower. It is HUGE, it's about 1000 pages and
I am not going to commit to that book anytime in the near future, which is
reason enough to be excited for the adaptation. I don't know how long Dark Tower
is, but if it is anywhere more than 400 pages, I am going to skip it.

The Circle has been on my list for a while now, it should have been read before
Emma actually. It's also a considerably long book, and I am not sure whether now
is the right time to start it. The adaptation is coming out very soon (or is
already out). I could rush to finish reading the book and then see the
adaptation in a theatre, the practicality of that plan isn't something I can
attest to.

Murder on the Orient Express goes onto my list, I don't like reading Agatha
Christie too much, but this one was really hyped up by everyone who read it. It
might be well worth the hype.

Today was **Day 1** of my 2 month internship at [Elanic](http://elanic.in).
