title: Technological Unemployment - Summary of a summary
categories: work productivity technology robots unemployment
---

There is this approach to consuming information online. I don't know what it is
called or who came up with it. The approach is to look at a topic, write down
the solid questions you would like to answer about the topic, consume the
material about this topic that's in front of you and after you are done, answer
the questions that you had started out with. With several blogs (esp Slate Star
Codex), this approach has helped me a lot. Especially because it gives me an
idea about what I would like to know, what my presumptions / beliefs about the
questions are _before_ I read the article and am influenced by the author's
presumptions and beliefs.

[Technological
Unemployment](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/19/technological-unemployment-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/)
is a post on Slate Star Codex. I have been following this blog, albeit without
understanding much on several occasions, for the past month and I jumped right
out of my seat when I realized what this post was about. I had recently had a
discussion about this with my parents in the context of the (lately increasing)
AI paranoia articles in mainstream online and offline media and on sources like
LinkedIn where people seem to be posting stuff about this all the time. (Elon
Musk's rather arbitrary position on this doesn't help)

Before I read the post, I wrote down some questions and after reading the post
(and taking notes, _yeah._), I answered them.

**Premise:**

Prime Age Male Labor Force Participation Rate went from 97% in 1950 to 88% in
\2014. Where did the ~10% of men go? Why aren't they part of the workforce
anymore? Were advances in technology the cause for their exit?

What sectors and income brackets were these 10% men a part of?


**Caveats**

1. This is third-hand information. Scott Alexander (the blog post's author) read
   several papers and reports about the topic and composed his post. I have read
   his post and skimmed through the text and analyzed the graphs in the
   [Brookings Institute Report][1].

1. My questions **will not** be the same as the questions you would like to
answer depending on your age, field of employment, childhood etc.

1. The studies concentrate on the labor market in the US. So, it's inherent in
   the blog post that everything is in the context of the American labor market.
   There will be wild differences between these numbers and the numbers for
   India or China, but the comparisons between the US and countries like Japan,
   Germany, Spain and other EU countries seems to indicate that the behaviour in
   these countries is more or less similar and the US labor market _may_ be used
   as a proxy for these countries' labor market.

1. The numbers in the tables have been taken from graphs that are mentioned
   below the tables. The numbers are representative and as accurate as can
   possibly be taken from a graph which doesn't have labels.

That said, here goes.

**Goal:** Are people losing jobs because of advances in technology?

### What age-group, level of education and gender dominates this set?

Throughout the analysis, we concentrate on Prime Age Male Labor Force
Participation Rates. i.e Men between the ages of 25 and 55 who have a job.
Female LFPR are not considered here because the main jump for Female LFPR
came around 1990-2000 and it seems rather premature to make anything of
numbers that are _only_ 20 years old.

**Age Group** - All age groups; But mainly advanced ages; where disability can
be a major cause for retirement before the age of 55 or a change of role at
home (_stay-at-home dad_); even apart from this, there seems to be some
indication that younger people have a degree of robustness in the selection
of their field of work and an option to go back to college and gain skills
as compared to older people.

**Level of education** - People whose level of education is less than
high-school are the worst affected. Men with college degrees show a rate of
decline that has remained more-or-less unchanged since 1950. The following table
shows the Prime Age Male Labor Force Participation Rate distribution for three
years across level of education:

Level of education | 1968 | 1988 | 2016
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
4 years of college and more | 97% | 95% | 94%
Some college but no 4-year degree | 96% | 95% | 87%
High school degree, no colege | 95% | 94% | 84%
Less than high school | 94% | 85% | 80%

_Figure 4, [Brookings Institute Report][1]_

**Gender:** Inconlusive

### What kind of technology lead to the loss of jobs?

> It's better to rephrase this question as "Which sector lost the most amount of
> jobs because of advances in technology?"

Manufacturing and middle-skill level, middle-wage jobs were the worst affected.
The conclusion on this is unanimous and there are no doubts about who was dealt
the worst hand here.

Manufacturing jobs as percent of total:

1948 - 30%
2010 - 10%

Manufacturing jobs (absolute numbers):

Year | Millions of jobs held in this sector
:--: | :---:
1970 | 18
1980 | 19.4
1990 | 17.9
2000 | 17.1
2010 | 11.5
2016 | 12.1

_Figure 6, [Brookings Institute Report][1]_

It's worth noting that the share of manufacturing the in the GDP has remained
fairly unchanged over this period of time.

Manufacturing has been losing jobs ever since World War 2. During the Industrial
Revolution, there was an exodus of people from agriculture to manufacturing.
Now, if there is to be an exodus, where would the people with the current
manufacturing jobs go?

Surprisingly, it's not the least-skilled jobs which lost out. In fact, they were
the ones that gained because it's fairly hard to automate these jobs away. These
jobs are manually intensive or require some level of interpersonal communication
and robustness (say against vandals or robberies in the case of truck drivers)
which are not easy to solve in the real world.

A quote from the article that sums it up:

> This is potentially consistent with a story where the jobs that have been
> easiest to automate are middle-class-ish. Some jobs require extremely basic
> human talents that machines can’t yet match – like a delivery person’s ability
> to climb stairs. Others require extremely arcane human talents likewise beyond
> machine abilities – like a scientist discovering new theories of physics. The
> stuff in between – proofreading, translating, records-keeping, metalworking,
> truck driving, welding – is more in danger.

There is one major caveat here though: As the number of jobs has always been
declining, it's hard to say without a shred of doubt that the jobs that were
lost were indeed lost because of automation and not because people had a change
of mind and decided to pursue other jobs or manufacturing jobs became less
desired or some reason not related to automation at all.

**Jobs were lost mainly in the manufacturing sector and in sectors that require
medium skill level and are middle-wage**

### Was this technology cheaper over a period of time, compared to hiring people?

I couldn't answer this question. Common sense seems to suggest that this should
be the case or else why would businesses do something that costs more and
employs fewer people? A quote from the blog post hints towards the same:

> There may be some point at which we too stop being worth more than it costs to
> replace us. And the decline of manufacturing, the increase in labor force
> nonparticipation and despair in rural Rust Belt communities, etc, suggest that
> point is fast arriving.

takes a stab at why even if one thing became cheaper, the inventors would be
_forced_ to move on to some other sector and if that continues, everything will
become really really cheap but everyone will also be out of a job. Where did I
end up?

Anyway, **Couldn't answer**.

### Did the jobs which were lost involve a hazardous work environment?

> Jobs like those on the 24 hour assembly line that cause a lot of employee

There's no particular indication here that jobs in hazardous environment were
more automated compared to non-hazardous environments. The Brookings Institute
report does provide a good out for us though.

Table 1 reports the "Most Rapidly Declining Industries - by employment
projections" as Apparel, Leather and allied manufacturing; Tobacco
manufacturing; Postal service; Federal enterprises except Postal services;
Manufacturing and reproducing magnetic and optical media. The first two sectors
in this list are hazardous when the proper employee safety norms aren't folloed,
but that probably won't be the case in the developed economies.

So, **Not very conclusive; But _some_ of the jobs which were lost did involve
hazardous environments**

### Were the jobs that were lost monotonous?

The answer to this is a resounding yes. Just from the definition of
middle-skill level, middle-wage jobs which have been the worst affected, this
should be apparent:

> Middle-paying occupations are **stationary plant and related operators; metal,
> machinery and related trade work; drivers and mobile plant operators; office
> clerks;** precision, handicraft, craft printing, and related trade workers;
> extraction and building trades workers; customer service clerks; **machine
> operators and assemblers;** and other craft and related trade workers

(The occupations in bold are monotonous, in my opinion. I am probably wrong, so
please make your own judgement)

So, **A resounding yes**

### Did the people who lost their job find another job?

> If yes, was the new job higher or lower paying than the old one?

Once again, we are stuck without any data. But we have some strong indications
about the trend here. The consensus seems to be that most of the workers who
were in middle-skill, middle-income jobs who lost their jobs, slid into
low-skill, low-wage jobs, because they couldn't complete the requirements and
acquire the skills to move to the high-skill, higher paying jobs.

This being the norm, there are certainly some people who do gain these skills
and move into higher paying jobs.

**Strong indications that most people who lost middle-income jobs, slipped into
low-wage jobs. While the others either exit the workforce or gained the skills
required to move to a high-skill, high-wage job**

***

I conclude exactly as Scott Alexander does at the end of his post. I don't think
the people who aren't part of the workforce anymore are not here because of the
advancements in technology.

Technology has always been progressing forward and there doesn't seem to be
anything historical happening right now (and there aren't any indications that
something of the sort will happen in the next few decades)

Perhaps the rosy picture painted by more people leaving the workforce early
to retire, take care of family at home, or because of disability is one worth
considering; even if it seems too good to be true and can't be accepted whole
heartedly.

That's the end of my third hand information dissemination effort. As mentioned
earlier, definitely read the SlateStarCodex post. If you have the time, then
read the [Brookings Insitute report][1]. It presents the data they have very well.
