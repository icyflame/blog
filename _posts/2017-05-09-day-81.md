In perhaps the largest backlog of mine in this series of posts, I am now four
posts behind. This post should have been out on 9th May, 2017.

I _must_ run a test about how many times I spoke about this series in a post. I
think it must be every other post. I am not even kidding. I am also at a
position where I mut write the posts for the next 4 days.

I have moved slightly forward in Heather Poole's book. Her mother becomes an air
hostess and starts working alongside her! That is probably one of the weirder
plot points in the book. The back stories and the way her roommates live their
lives is rather interesting. I am glad she spent as much time as she did on
describing them.

Paula Hawkins released a new book called Into the Water. Megan Miranda is on
tour for promoting her new book Perfect Stranger. The female psycho-thriller
fiction market seems to be on the up ever since the stellar Gone Girl and
the equally good book but slightly less hot adaptation The Girl On the Train.

I am hoping for an imaginative plot with some crazy (and believable) twists.
