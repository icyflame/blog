In [the previous post](/economy/india/economic-theory/governments/central-banks/2021/01/11/india-central-bank-intervention-goals-1-the-problem/), we looked at what the RBI has been doing over the 2020 calendar year. The
over-all effect of RBI's interventions have been that the exchange rate (INR to USD ratio) has
remained within a narrow window, despite the unprecedented capital inflows into the Indian equity
market. This is by design, and the RBI has tried to explain their policy a few times in various
documents. Although this excess liquidity can theoretically cause high inflation and have an adverse
impact on the currency, a couple other things are happening simultaneously and making this policy
prudent (existing over-valuation and RBI's strong balance sheet). After reading some of these
documents, here's my thesis of the advantages and disadvantages of what the RBI has been doing, as I
best understand it.

# Advantages


## Monetary Policy Transmission

One of RBI's goals is to set monetary policy. In an ideal world, they would set a policy with a
given policy goal (e.g. bring down food inflation) and this policy would be transmitted to
end-consumers **perfectly** through the various economic institutions that sit in between them and the
RBI (e.g. state banks, corporate investors, foreign investors, etc). As you might have guessed, we
don't live in an ideal world and the RBI has to have a policy to ensure that their monetary policy
is transmitted to end-consumers and has the required effects.

By maintaining excess liquidity in the system, they are trying to ensure that policy transmission is
close to perfect by maintaining the operating rate (the interest rate at which banks borrow in
reality) close to the policy rate (the interest rate at which banks borrow directly from the
RBI). The high supply of local currency and constant deregulation at the RBI ensures that banks can
borrow at [rates](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50946) close to [the policy rates](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/WSSView.aspx?Id=24262). This can be seen in the release from 8th January 2021:
The short term market repo rate was 3.20%, whereas the policy repo rate for this period was 4.00%,
and the reverse repo policy rate was 3.35%.

This can be a crucial tool during a recession to increase consumer spending and economic activity,
as it has been found to be effective at (say) increasing the amount of real estate loans that are
being issued and helping firms and households start spending again. The RBI has noted this in their
last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in early Dec 2020:

## Control over-valuation of the INR

When foreign inflows into an economy are high due to a perceived increase in forward earnings, the
risk of over-valuation of the local currency starts going up. This over-valuation adversely impacts
exports (As the local currency appreciates against reserve currencies, foreign buyers will have to
pay more for the same commodity, provided that their local currency is not appreciating as
quickly). To curb over-valuation, the Central bank will purchase the foreign inflows and park them
as Forex reserves on their balance sheet.

This absorption of the capital inflow by the central bank is also lucrative as it ensures that a
sudden-stop in the capital inflows will not destabilize the market. The central bank can start
removing liquidity from the market gradually, allowing the sudden-stop gradually. In India's case,
the probability of a sudden-stop is low as 1-year forward earnings are still high, and there are no
big changes in policy or government that are expected until Dec 2021. The next central government
election is only in 2024, a long time away.

Once again, here's an excerpt from the [MPC minutes](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50831):

> The intervention that is raising foreign exchange reserves is required because over-valuation of the
> rupee can hurt exports, raise country risk and lead to a sharp depreciation later. Prolonged inflows
> can lead to over-valuation without intervention. Surges and sudden stops of capital flows to
> emerging markets due to advanced economy quantitative easing have hurt emerging market growth in the
> decade after the global financial crisis.


# Disadvantages

The RBI has been weighing these disadvantages against the economic growth that is being supported by
the excess liquidity. Ultimately, their decision to stick with their current policy comes down to
their belief that these disadvantages are not devastating even in the worst case and that the risk
is bearable.


## Impact on Consumer Price Index (CPI) Inflation

Excess liquidity's biggest impact is on CPI inflation: the excess liquidity in the system makes it
easier for firms to invest and they subsequently raise their commodity prices. In some cases, it is
possible to maintain high liquidity but prevent an increase in inflation <span class="underline">due</span> to this. These cases
generally happen when the inflation rates are already quite high and expected to remain high due to
external reasons. As we saw in the previous post, the current high inflation rates in India (October
CPI inflation = 7.6%) are caused by the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on supply chains and some
untimely rains in the harvest season. RBI's monetary policy is not connected to the current high
inflation rate.

Even in these situations, the already-high inflation rates <span class="underline">can</span> be exasperated by the liquidity
surplus. So, the effect on inflation should be closely watched and liquidity suppression tools
should be used when the trend shifts. RBI is on track to do this, although some economists and
analysts believe that RBI's hand will be [forced](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/wave-of-foreign-money-threatens-india-s-tight-grip-on-the-rupee) in 2021 as (say) food inflation starts to go up
again before or during the summer months.

> Analysts suggest the RBI will be forced to address the [liquidity] glut early in 2021.

Here's an excerpt from the MPC minutes:

> To the extent it is transient the contribution of excess liquidity to cost push inflation is
> limited. In an open economy import competition also caps price rise, especially with a rupee that is
> tending to appreciate, provided tariffs and taxes are moderated.


### RBI keeps government borrowing costs low

As the economy is stressed due to various state-wide lockdowns and a sluggish consumer, the
government has been borrowing heavily. The budget deficit for FY2020-21 is now estimated to
end up at about 8%, which is twice the budgeted value of 4%. This deficit is being made up by
government debt issues. A lot of these debt issues have been purchased by the RBI. This has ensured
that the government's borrowing costs in the long term (i.e. 3-, 5- and 10-year bond yields) have
actually gone down.

This is one facet of the RBI's theory of [Economic Capital Framework](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=47983). This theory enhances the
central bank's role from simply avoiding financial volatility, to being a backstop when the
government's finances are deteriorating. The central bank aims to achieve this goal by maintaining a
strong balance sheet and transferring balance sheet capital surplus (equity above the required rate
and whole of net income) to the central government. (**Note:** I have been reading about this theory
and I am still trying to understand it's background and where it came from. I might do a series of
posts about this in the future.)


## Short-term rates crash

[This article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/wave-of-foreign-money-threatens-india-s-tight-grip-on-the-rupee) makes an interesting claim:

> Lower shorter rates without a similar drop in long-term borrowing costs means a steeper yield curve,
> which tends to undermine efforts to stoke growth.

This is also discussed vaguely in the MPC minutes:

I don't know whether this short-term interest rate crash can have long-term impacts. It looks like
the Monetary policy committee is divided on this point and while the decrease in short term rates is
not being supported by any of the members and is being opposed by some members, they don't feel that
the risk has risen to a level where they have to act and intervene to support this rate.
