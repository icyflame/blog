This text perfectly describes this book. But the author put it at around the 90%
mark, right when the book is about to end and you are starting to understand the
kind of closure you will get from this book.

As far as disorienting books go, I have found those with non-linear timelines to
be the most disorienting. In particular, you don't know what's going on, you
have completely lost your place in the story of the book, you are invested in
seeing the main character get out of whatever jam they are in but you have
absolutely no clue where to go or which way will take the character forward and
which will simply be a regression.

The Trial started (for me) with all of these confusions. K. was arrested, but he
could keep working. The men who came to his house to tell him he was arrested
were strange and didn't behave as powerful men would have, K. is extremely
apologetic to his neighbours and does some strange stuff: visiting a female
neighbour at around 11 pm and so on. He is annoyed and confused, just as I was
annoyed and confused at the author's disinterest in telling me what was going
on.

This feeling never quite goes away, throughout the book. At every step, you
think this new character is probably not going to be very important, and they
are not, but you get a lot of exposition about them and if it's a female
character, they are immediately taken by K.'s looks and fall in love with him.
The author even addresses this himself while talking about how all the accused
were attractive in one way or another:

> this peculiarity of hers consists in this; Leni finds most of the accused
> attractive. She attaches herself to each of them, loves each of them, even
> seems to be loved by each of them; then she sometimes entertains me by telling
> me about them when I allow her to. I am not so astonished by all of this as
> you seem to be.

The other thing that Kafka does a disturbingly good job at is showing government
offices, the people working in them and the way proceedings are handled. I had
to visit the Regional Passport Office in Kolkata, India once. And the first trip
that K. takes on a Sunday to the _court_ sounded eerily famiiar because it was
on a similar errand: I had no idea why I didn't have my passport yet, I had to
wait in line from about 10 am to 2 pm, there were a lot of people around me, the
clerks in the office were the king-makers that day, the inability to see any of
the _senior officers_ in the office who would certainly understand my situation
and finally, the breathlessness when you are just inside the door and are not
yet used to the universal lack of ventilation.

**P.S.** The second-last chapter in the cathedral leading up to the ending is
weird. It has an anecdote about a doorman and it sounds vaguely similar to K.'s
story and experience with the court, but not really.


### Some quotes

> he admits he doesn't know the law and at the same time insists he's innocent.

-- When stated as literally as that, it seems rather stupid to ever say that one
is innocent or that someone else is guilty because no one knows the law. When we
say we're innocent, I think we tend to use our value judgement of right and
wrong and try to decide what we would classify what we did as; thinking about
innocence as something determined by one's value system and not by the written
word of law.

> Unfortunately, though, he would still have to make it clear to K. that the

> anything written.

-- Catch-22 style contradiction! LOVE IT
