title: Offline Advertising - Familiarity
categories: advertising old-school
---

I read a few excellent (albeit old) articles on advertising recently. A few of
them were on [The Doc Searls Weblog][1]. My main take away from these articles
was that offline advertising is not _ineffective_ because an ad run on TV is
seen by all sorts of people and is targeted at a cross section of the
population; In fact, it is _very effective_ because of that very property.

I recently made a cross-country move (more on this in a later post). I wanted to
select a phone contract in the new country. There were several companies and it
was all very confusing. I had two references: a contract that my company's HR
people recommended and companies that I had heard of before (particularly,
SoftBank and Docomo). I had heard of these companies not because I had used them
before. I had heard of them through old-school advertising!

We all know the names of a lot of companies whose products we have never used.
That doesn't mean that the money the companies spent on getting us to know their
names was wasted, OH NO! It only means that the return is more long term than
that.

Now, when I walk into the huge super market aisle of moisturizers in a foreign
country, I will see a lot of brands on the shelf. But the moment I see Pantene
or Nivea, my brain will make a quick connection and this familiarity will make
it very likely that I buy their products. All this pretty unscientific and
anecdotal; but I am fairly confident that this is how all of us work.

I have never used Pantene's soaps or Nivea's creams before, but I have seen
their ads on TV, I have seen big celebrities appear in their ads, so I know that
Pantene spends a whole lot of money on their ads. They probably believe that
their product is genuinely good, or why else would they do that? They could just
get a Google AdWords account and try targetting people whose last search on
Amazon was "moisturizer".
