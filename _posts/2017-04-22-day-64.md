title: Day 64 - My thoughts on a Quora answer I disliked, why are titles on Medium so clickbait-y?

Yesterday, a friend shared [this Quora
answer]https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-psychological-facts-that-people-dont-know-1/answer/Dorottya-T%C3%B3th) which ended up with it appearing on my news feed.

I read the answer and instantly disliked the contentions made by the author. I
was going to let it go, until someone asked me to ellaborate on _why_ I disliked
the answer. I had to think about this for just a bit, after which I came up with
this **extremely** long answer:

I have definitely written down everything that I didn't like about the answer.
One of the responses to this comment was very interesting:

(emphasis mine)

The bringing the focus onto one point is a major reason for my moving off of
these two platforms. Medium especially faces this problem a lot. Most of the
articles on Medium are preachy, clickbaity or give you a list to do something.
Frankly, it's rather irritating.

While Quora is something that has content which can be enjoyed as entertainment,
one must never make the mistake of taking Quora answers and associating them to
words that are even near as strong as "facts". Most things on Quora are
experience based, and only those questions are worth reading. That said, there
is something off about these two platforms. Maybe it's the lack of curation and
the algorithmic suggestion of articles based on our past reads, which in most
cases are just one-time reads to understand a topic. 

If I saw a Medium article about "Why people should write", that doesn't mean you
fill my newsfeed with "How to become a great writer in 6 months" articles for
the next 10 years. That doesn't make any sense. These platforms perhaps work
best when you use them as your primary source for user created content. If you
consume content across the Internet, you are probably going to have a bad
experience with them.

To prove my point, I will show the first few posts on my Medium feed:

***

Now, I am aware that I am **judging an article by it's title and thumbnail** and
that some of these articles might be really good. But the fact that all those
titles irritate me and I would _never_ click on something like that is enough to
understand that I would never get to know whether those articles were good or
not. **Can we tone it down, please?**

I would like less Clickbait-y, more news-like titles which don't give me a list,
or tell me what I _must_ do, but a title that tells me what the content of the
article is.

Now that you have reached here, take all of that with a table spoon of salt
because I don't spend any time on Medium and I don't know anything about how the
articles with irritating titles are underneath the hood.

**POST #64 is OVER**
