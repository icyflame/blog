Ah, finally, I made some **real** progress with Emma (Austen). The characters
are realy panning out, this book is far easier to read than I would have thought
of, she writes in a simple style, and there are a few complex sentences here and
there, but most of them are conversational and easy to understand!

I learnt some archaic spellings that I believed were typos, hilariously. _choose_
was spelled _chuse_ and _show_ was spelled _shew_. Very very surprising!

I am almost immediately reminded of this movie:

[![img](/blog/public/img/day-41-1.jpg)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1509732/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

A 2010 Hindi movie with Sonam Kapoor as Aisha and Abhay Deol and some other good
actors. Aisha is definitely inspired from Emma, she's rich, good looking,
doesn't want to get married and has a father who indulges every one of her
insane plans about the new girl that she befriends and is determined to match
with a friend of hers from her own social circle, while that girl is in love
with some other boy from her _life before Aisha_. It's an _OKAY_ movie, one of
the songs is really good, and it's an over-all not too heavy, chilled out
account of a rich, young girl's life. I wonder if this novel was credited in
that movie. Although this kind of a story is quite common and it doesn't need an
Austen to tell us about it, the specific circumstances are too similar.

The ages of most characters have been revealed now. Knightley is 37-38, Elton is
27 and Harriet is not even 18 yet. Emma's age hasn't come up just yet, but I
guess she would be in her twenties because she is definitely older than Harriet
and Elton's admiration (love?) for her suggests that she might be his
contemporary. Knightley is the voice of reason in the book, that's Abhay Deol
character's in the movie. At the end movie-Aisha and movie-Abhay Deol get
toether and get married or something, I wonder if that's even _possible_ with
this book. Just have to wait and see what is going to happen.

I also watched the finale of [People v. O J
Simpson](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6205862/?ref_=nv_sr_1). I didn't know the
outcome, I don't want to spill any spoilers for the people who haven't seen the
live news coverage or the show yet. I can't say anything about it because like
one masterful scene in the show where detective Mark Fuhrman is asked:

Cochran: Did you falsify any evidence in this case?
Fuhrman: I assert my Fifth Amendment privilege

This was a masterful stroke from Shapiro and Cochran.

In some more TV news, an Emmy for Rupert Friend is in the air? He had one
nomination in 2013, probably for the first season as Quinn where he was **THE
BADASS TO BE**. Now, he has a much deeper role and is pulling it off INCREDIBLY
well! I wish he gets an Emmy! #EmmyForRupert
