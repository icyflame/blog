title: Day 16 - zsh, color schemes and auto-mounting partitions with an elegant password prompt
categories: 100daysofwriting programming ubuntu installation setup
---

This is part 2 of the installation diary. While the backing up and install
process was done, an installation is only complete _after_ everything goes back
to normal.

**Step 1:** shell, aliases, functions. I maintain a **good** dotfiles
repository, which I have improved over time. The [bootstrap
script](https://github.com/icyflame/dotfiles/blob/master/bootstrap.sh) is a
shell script that does a lot of stuff. I use it in my default User data on
Digital Ocean droplets, when I create one, and it works really well! This will
install my shell of choice: zsh, and will also install all the other basic
things that are definitely required: ruby, node, vim. This gives a great point
to start at for other packages that you also need but can do without for some
time.

There was a slight hiccup in the zsh installation, probably because something
has changed in the zsh readme or setup (?), but I didn't care to spend any more
time there, so I quickly ran the script that was there on the readme, and zsh
was installed with my favourite oh-my-zsh theme: ys. It's a theme that uses only
basic ASCII characters that ensures that it will work on all machines! I hate
seeing boxes where tick marks should have been. The way `ys` shows an updated
git tree with a green `o`. And un-updated trees are shown with a red `x`. Both
of those choices are great, and completely compatible! So great.

**Step 2:** After this, comes the all important color scheme setup. The color scheme
**must** be Solarized Dark. (Not really, I just love it a lot more than any
other scheme. To each, their own!) I use base16 because there is a regression
in the earlier one I used
([gnome-terminal-solarized issue #32](https://github.com/Anthony25/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized/issues/32))
There has been extensive discussion on this issue and a related issue [solarized
issue #220](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/issues/220). I first encountered
this issue when I was switching to gnome-terminal-solarized from the default
solarize option that is available in the preferences menu. Clearly, nothing has
been fixed or updated since then! I couldn't understand a lot of the discussion
on that issue unfortunately. Anyway, base 16 provides a good dark 256 base which
works pretty well! The solarized dark 16 color scheme doesn't work because the
color of the bold text used for listing executable files is almost the same as
the background color and completely invisible. Examples ahead:

_Fig 1: see the `a.out` file's color. It's hardly visible_

_Fig 2: ah, much better!_

(I zoomed into the terminal for taking those screenshots, and did that look
gorgeous! :D And I am _only_ on a 1080p ancient Samsung Matt finish monitor. I
think it's the Matt finish of the display that makes this look so great! If you
have matt finish, then you probably know what I am talking about out. If not,
well!)

**Step 3:** Partitions: Mounting the un-encrypted partitions AND the encrypted
partitions, all at startup in a proper fail safe manner. No one should be able
to read anything!

This happened in two iterations because I made a mistake the first time around.
I added this line to `/etc/crypttab`: `code UUID=...`

Restarted the computer. The boot failed. Booting from recovery and trying to get
in dropped me into a root shell which thankfully had write-access to the disk. I
removed the offending lines from the `crypttab` and restarted, and things were
fine once more.

The second time, I did it right: Thanks to [this
tutorial](https://evilshit.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/how-to-mount-a-luks-encrypted-partition-on-boot/).
I was a bit doubtful about this because it didn't have a picture of how the
interactive password prompt looked like (it actually looks really good!) and
it's 5 years old. Anyway, I took the plunge and it worked. On to the
un-encrypted NTFS and FAT32 partitions.

These were much simpler. I used `udisks` in Ubuntu 14.04. Now, that command has
changed to a simple `udisksctl -b /dev/sda3` etc. Add this to the Startup
Programs list that comes up when you search on the Dash, and you are done! Much
easier.

So, thus, I am more or less done with my installation. It was a pleasant process
except for the backing up part which was a bit problematic because of the sheer
lack of space! More stories tomorrow.

**POST #16 is OVER**
