Handmaid's Tale was released as an audiobook. That's not the best part of the
news. The best part: **It is narrated by CLAIRE DANES**. OH MY!

I found the above excerpts on Audible's Soundcloud, and they are _DOPE!_. This
audiobook also has some new material, that was added by Margaret Atwood herself!

The TV series of this book is going to premiere on 26th April, in 3 days. The
trailer for that series (which is going to be on Hulu) is also stirring. There's
a lot of new material for this book coming out this year. AH, SUCH GREAT TIMES!

I was rather stunned with the Audiobook version that Claire Danes performed. I
have since found that there are two versions here, in 2013, Claire Danes
performed this book for the first time. THat won a few awards and was wildly
popular.

Now, it seems she has performed this again(?) or they have used the same audio
again. From the reviews on the [new Audible
listing](http://www.audible.com/pd/Fiction/The-Handmaids-Tale-Special-Edition-Audiobook/B06XFW9YZ5/ref=t2_asin_pd_anonhp),
it seems that they _added_ scenes to the audiobook, an essay, an afterword by
the author herself, a Q&A with the professor (which appears as an epilogue in
the book), but the main voice acting that Claire Danes did has been left
unchanged. The old [Amazon.in
listing](http://www.amazon.in/Handmaids-Tale-Classic-Collection/dp/1480560103/ref=sr_1_1_twi_mp3_6) for the MP3 CD
that has the older audiobook is great! I think I will pick that up.

Audible's pricing is pretty confusing too, I am not sure if it's a subscription
or if you can simply buy a single book and be done with it. Why does it have to
be so confusing? Amazon seems to have made buying Books and e-Books simpler, but
Audible is still a confusing maze that I have been stuck in. (I would love to
use the trial and buy this book, but would it then mean that I will have this
book forever or it will just lapse after 30 days and I won't have access
anymore?)

There's also this YouTube promotional video that was released in 2012:

The quiver in her voice when she talks about "Her Story" is _very_ recognizable
from her difficult scenes in Homeland (especially the one in which Quinn ( :( )
and Carrie shoot a video to show Franny in the previous season).

I watched [Fargo
(1996)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/) today. The fact that these events
actually happened in reality is pretty disturbing.
