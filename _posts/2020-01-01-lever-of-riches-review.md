title: Notes and Review - The Lever of Riches (Mokyr)

## Summary

The Lever of Riches is a great book. I think I say that about a lot of books
though. Lever of Riches is a 3-part book. In the first part, Mokyr presents a
concise history of Technological progress starting in 500 BC and ending around
\1915. In the second part, Mokyr compares the relative technological progress in
three periods across time and space and the possible reasons (he touches on
religion, culture, geography and national sentiment as possible reasons). In the
last part, he draws an analogy between Biological Evolution and Technological
progress.

I liked the first and second parts immensely. I didn't find the last part (the
analogy) very intersting or useful.

Some of the notes I made as I was reading this book.

## Part 1

- Water wheels are very important!
- Compass - 1300 - A single self-contained unit; this made year-round navigation
  possible
- Printing Press - Gutenberg - 1453 - In the 50 years following this invention,
  more books were produced as compared to the preceding 1000 years.
- The educated class and the working class must interact closely and regularly.
  People in the educated class have the potential and opportunity to innovate
  and create new solutions whereas only people in the working class know what
  problems exist. If there is a disconnect between these two groups of people
  (as in Ancient Societies where children were educated and kept far from all
   proagmatic matters) innovation suffers.
- Double Entry Book-keeping - 1350
- Steam Engine - 1712 - 4.5% efficiency

> In conjunction with other inventions, power technology created the gap between
> Europe and the rest of the world, a temporary dis-equilibrium that allowed the
> Europeans to establish global political and military domination.

- Electric generator - 1870 - Stable, continuous current without over-heating
- Progress in communication - Early 1800s, London -> Calcutta -> London postage
  might take as long as 2 years. 1914 -> Less than 2 weeks!
- Bicycle - 1885 - The first means of transportation that was cheap and truly
  personal
- Typewriter - 1874 - The Remington Company buys the patent for the typewriter
- Automobile - 1876 - Otto creates the 4-stroke engine
- Radio - 1906

> Technological growth seems to be the only avenue of sustained growth

## Part 2

- Every invention has private and societal costs - Are both parties willing to
  bear this cost?
- Inventors must be willing to bear risk to change the status quo. A lot of
  factors that inventors struggle with are permissive rather than causal
- Technological progress is path dependent - Progress begets Progress
    - Societies that accidentally bet on the slower horse might not realize how
      much potential other players in the race had! They might drop an idea
      simply because the first iteration they chose was incorrect
        - Camels in Middle East - 500 BC - This precluded the building of roads,
          but it also precluded the invention of rail roads!
- Religion affects inventors
    - The Christian attitude towards nature helps - The world was created by God
      for man and nature exists to be manipulated and enjoyed
    - India's entrenched caste system is the ultimate status-quo maintaining
      structure
        - "Hindi doctrine holds that castepromotion is possible through
          re-incarnation if one lives an appropriately resigned and obedient
          life. ... Poverty was holy and action was vanity."
        - "A fiendish failure proof system to ensure the status quo"
        - This discourages rebeliousness
- Values - What do members of a society value?
    - Ancient societies valued art and military accomplishments above wealth
    - Do the educated work? Are the people who work educated?
- Openness to _new information_
    - Islamic beliefs started to converge to a point where it was believed that
      most of the information had already been discovered and that a modern
      Muslim need only accept and repeat

## Part 3

- Dynastic states are tolerant of non-conformist behaviour
- Political unification doesn't imply peace

- There was no demand for European goods in China whereas Europeans were
  interested in a lot of things produced only in the Orient
- A single ruler instead of several rulers like in Europe - A single ruler can
  stop any technology in it's tracks with minimal effort. In Europe, inventors
  could fairly easily emigrate to a nearby nation and hence it was harder for
  rulers to suppress innovation for long
- Technological progress went forward unabated in Britain because the rich and
  powerful held their wealth in Real Estate and Agriculture and these were not
  threatened by the progress in (say) the cotton industry

- Britain's decline can probably be attributed to a dislike of applied science

> A gentleman only concerns himself with the lofty ideals of pure science,
> scientific research for it's own sake

## Review

1. **Great summarization:** What is this book about? I think that if you read
the Introduction part of the book, you understand that and know exactly what's
about to come. So many books are free-wheeling narratives of the author's
research areas that it has few (if any) connections to the topic at hand once
you are deep into the book. This book doesn't lose the plot. It aims to provide
one possible explanation for the apparent difference in quality of life between
the West and most of Asia and Africa.

> If the West is on teh whole comfortable, even opulent, compared to the
> appaling poverty still rampant in most of Asia and Africa, it is in large part
> thanks to its technology.

1. **Excellent structure:** I started noticing this in non-fiction books after
the majorly disorienting narrative in The Box (Levinson). That was also a great
book, but the fact that the narrative wasn't chronological really messed up my
comprehension of the book. Lever of Riches stays on track and moves linearly
through the Ancient times, the Industrial Revolution to the late 20th century.
There are no unnecessary breaks, few parallel narratives which are always
geographically isolated.

1. **Description and analysis of other prevalent theories:** The author leans
heavily on work done by others in his attempt to prove his own theory. And along
this line, it was fairly clear to me, every step along the way that whatever the
author was saying was thoroughly researched and that the author had seriously
considered what other people believed and had not dismissed their points of view
out of hand.

1. **History of technological progress:** The second part of the book is a
concise history of technological progress. There are several diagrams and a lot
of dates and names. I felt that the author did justice to this topic and I
learnt a _LOT_ just from this part of the book. If anything, **I highly
recommend** this part of the book in isolation. A better book of technological
history definitely exists out there and the author admits as much, but I felt
that the detail Mokyr goes into is just right. (My opinion is bound to change
when I read a more thorough history which touches on some of the things Mokyr
skipped over)

1. **Great comparisons:** The comparisons that make up the third part of the
book are definitely my highlight from this book. I liked the times and countries
he compared because I have struggled in the past to understand the vast gap in
the servies and quality of life in these places first hand, and this book helped
me understand one probable cause for these differences.

1. **Not crazy about the Evolution analogy:** The last part of the book is an
attempt by Mokyr to draw several parallels between biological evolution and
technological progress. The analogy seems to hold in most cases and there are
several holes, etc. In general though, **I didn't like** this part of the book
as much as I liked the preceding 2 parts.
