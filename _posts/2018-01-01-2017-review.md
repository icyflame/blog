title: Year in Review - 2017

This has been a pretty good year for my blog, I think(??). Of course, the
metrics that I use are rather subjective and might not bear even a semblance to
the truth. In my head, 2017's quick recap would definitely feature these things:

- I started
    [100DaysOfWriting](https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/tag/#100daysofwriting) on
    the 18th of February. That was also my first post on the blog in 2017, and
    in almost a year!
- [SHA-1 was broken](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html)
    for the first time with some binary padding data, two PDFs had the same
    SHA-1 even though they were different!
- I watched a little bit of Veep, but then gave up after the 4th season! Selena
    was just about to become president. I wish I could continue where I left
    off, unfortunately, it's too late for that now.
- My [git patch was ejected](https://public-inbox.org/git/xmqqinjnhcr8.fsf@gitster.mtv.corp.google.com/)
 (not merged into master), but the patch made it as far as pu.
    I had a really good time reading the code that powers so much
    of software today. It was fun, I will pick it up again
    sometime in the next year.
- I updated from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to [16.04 LTS](https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/writing/ubuntu/installation/2017/03/04/day-15/)
  After a nerve wracking few hours of guess work, I was able to get encrypted
  ext4 partitions to work! (+ [auto-mounting on start-up](https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/programming/ubuntu/installation/setup/2017/03/05/day-16/)
- I watched and absolutely loved Big Little Lies S1. Season 2 is going to be
    absolutely epic!
- Homeland's 6th Season lived upto the mark and then some. Quinn's resurrection
    is on the cards, I hope
- Cloudfare faced Cloudbleed and the buffer overflow error reared it's head once
    more! Thankfully, GoLang is here to solve all the problems. (Right?!)
- I struggled with a weird bug on Ubuntu where my mouse would simply stop
    working now and again. I am still facing this bug, but it has reduced to
    a much more acceptable number of occurences. The [modprobe fix](https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/writing/technology/problems/problem-solving/2017/03/25/day-36/)
    works for now.
- I started reading Austen! I read Emma, Sense and Sensibility and
    Persuasion. Her other three novels are on deck for next year.
- Handmaid's Tale (Atwood) took the spot of "The Dystopia I fear most",
    displacing 1984.
- Demonetisation was an eerie reminder of the power that the
    state wields in this country
- The internet came together on r/place and did something to a canvas that
    boggled everyone's mind and captured my imagination. Oh, I LOVE the
    Internet!
- I re-watched about 10 seasons worth of Seinfeld. I am not exagerrating.
- United Airlines dragged a passenger through the cabin and everyone was
    hysteric about it. Ended up reading [a book written by a flight attendant](https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/airplanes/books/2017/05/14/day-86/)
    and developing a lot of empathy
- I taped my webcam, updated my RSA keys to 4096 bits and enabled ufw to close
    all ports, all the time. Go Privacy!
- I found the [Nautilus update irritating](https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/nautilus/missed/rant/ubuntu/update/open-mic/comedy/2017/04/14/day-56/)
    but didn't switch and am now quite happy about it!
- I watched Masaan, Lunchbox, Contagion, and Another Earth for the umpteenth
    time
- I interned at [Elanic](http://elanic.in/) for 2 months! I learned a lot and
    it helped me _get_ Node.js!
- WannaCry happened, MalwareTechBlog stopped it, then MalwareTechBlog got stuck
    in the US (and is still there!)
- I [stayed with Chrome](https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/chrome/browsers/twitter/2017/05/11/day-83/)
  and then, switched to Quantum two days after it released. Quantum is the best
  browser I have ever used in my life till now!
- I had a tweet blow up (to some extent).
	[![twitter-screenshot](/public/img/2017-05-11-twitter.png)](https://twitter.com/_icyflame/status/862524711980285953/)
- I was stranded in
    [Koramangala](https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/100daysofwriting/nature/floods/bangalore/2017/05/26/day-98/)
    for a couple hours and then we waded through a feet of water at around 1 am to get home!
- I started listening to
    [Podcasts](https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/writing/books/2017/06/01/an-update/)
    and I haven't been able to go back to my way of life before. They are only
    getting better and more popular, so that's one of the good things that
    happened this year!
- I watched the 19 episodes of My So Called Life! That show **did not** deserve
    to be cancelled right in the middle of a season
- I watched 2 seasons of Downton Abbey and I am absolutely in love with Sybil's
    character
- I read parts the TLS 1.2 RFC and [wrote an overview](https://www.siddharthkannan.in/tls-handshake/).
  Considering that this came in handy in an interview I had later this year,
  this has been a very worthwhile use of time. Much more so than I had
  anticipated it at the
  [beginning](https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/internet/tls/security/https/2017/06/13/understanding-tls/)
- I spent [Durga Pujo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_Puja) in Kolkata and
    saw first-hand how chaotic a city can be!
- I raved about [NPM's abrupt change to their download-stats API](https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/npm/api/goofs/software/2017/10/08/npm-downloads-api-change/)
    which got [some attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/750887/npm_changes_downloads_api_and_informs_the_world/?ref=share&ref_source=link)
- I obsessed over [Primer (2004)](https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/tag/#primer)
    and managed to untangle most of the mysteries. This is going right up there
    on the shelf of my favourite movies of all time.
- I watched Arrival and fell in love with time travel, aliens, Amy Adams,
    science and language. All over again!

And here we are. 1st January, 2018.

**P.S** This post ended up using the pronoun "I" a lot more than I expected it
to. I didn't know how to phrase what I wanted to say appropriately without doing
that. The excessive usage does make me uncomfortable, but I guess it can't be
avoided. [Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=633rwYgYJDs) did the
same thing when he made a review video. His videos are SO GOOD.
