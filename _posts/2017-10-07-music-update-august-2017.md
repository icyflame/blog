title: Music Update - August 2017
categories: monthly music update
---

Ah, so now, I can finally get to it! (I have been wanting to write this article
since August 31, but something kept getting in the way. Also, writing it is sort
of a hassle because I have to get the screenshots etc. So, maybe I was putting
it away.) On with it!

_Quickly:_ There's a recommendations section at the end. It has 3 songs I think
you should listen to. If you are not interested in my droning on and on about
lyrics and throwbacks and percieved similarities, press `END` on your keyboard
and check those three songs out!

This month was about two TV shows: the Atypical Season 1 soundtrack and a couple
of songs that come up in Modern Family!

The first two tracks are from Modern Family. The first one's really old and I
hadn't ever heard of it. It's a beautiful story to listen to!

* Paint It Black from the Westworld sound track made a comeback. It has a great
    piano beginning. But the bass drum + violin accompaniment captured my
    imagination a lot more! I have no clue what Ramin Djawadi does, but whatever he
    does, I wish he keeps doing it.

    I rememeber he also did the one good thing about the Game of Thrones season
    finale: the soundtrack to that long scene in which Cersei burns buildings up,
    the king commits suicide etc. Come to think of it, that track also reminds me
    of this with the deep bass and the sustained note. There were vocals in that
    track (it's called Finale). But the organ is still predominant. His style is
    unique!

* I recommend the [Atypical Season 1
    Soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/user/siddharth_kannan_12/playlist/3sZEhd23RcB2CatiI9AfJJ).
    I have linked a Spotify playlist of the songs that stood out the most to me.
    Heads will Roll and Love Struck were stuck in my head for days (still are!).

    White Lies was the one song I had already heard in this bunch! When it came
    on in the series, I remember the scene also. She's walking down the steps
    and going to Nick's bar, and then the song fades out as she says something.
    I was so excited to recognize a song from a TV show. It was like recognising
    Paint It, Black when it came on in Westworld.

* Before I go to the albums I heard this month, a couple of the outliers here.
    Trains by Porcupine Tree and Pokerface by Lady Gaga (the latter is not in
    the screenshot). Trains just came back as a whim, I sort of wanted to listen
    to the prelude to that song.

    Pokerface came to my mind because of *HOW SIMILAR* it sounds to Heads will
    Roll! The same aggresive female vocals, the similar drop. The resemblance
    was pleasant!

* Album 1: **Bookends by Simon and Garfunkel**

  I had a particularly good month in terms of the number of new albums I heard
  this month! Three in total, 1 I started last month but the remaining two were
  wildcards!

  Bookends is a really old album and I am certain that I am the last to get on
  the Simon and Garfunkel bandwagon. They are SO GOOD! I watched some of their
  live performances as well, nothing stood out.

  My favourites are quite obviously Track 10: Mrs. Robinson and Track 11: Hazy
  Shade of Winter! I am obsessed with Hazy Shade of Winter. It's only 2:17,
  which sucks. There's literally nothing else I can even think about. It's a
  CLASSIC!  The way I found it was also a really surprising and funny event. I
  heard the whole album mainly because I had played Mrs. Robinson from the album
  on Spotify and Spotify played the whole album.

  Sadly, apart from 6, 10, 11 and 12, nothing else really stuck. I am not sure
  why, probably just because it's just so old and it's from another era.
  Something like that.

* Album 2: **Broken Machine by Nothing but Thieves**

    ![img](/public/img/music-aug-2017-broken-machine.png)

    I started with their debut album last month. And THIS MONTH! I started
    listening to it with Sorry and Amsterdam. But as I heard all of it, and
    repeatedly heard it all, I realised that I couldn't find one track that I
    wanted to skip when I was listening to this album! It's insanely
    time-consuming, but also so satisfying!

    This album is sort-of the reason that I have such disbelief at how good this
    month has been in terms of new music and the amount of GREAT tracks I found.

    From this one, I have to choose Tracks 1-7, 9, 11-13. There's no going
    around the fact that I have left out Particles and two acoustic renditions.
    I really don't want to leave anything out. Particles is like If I Get High
    and different from the other songs in the album and that's why it sounded
    out of place to me. That is the only reason that I have left it out.

    4, 5, 6, 7 have such good lyrics. Especially, this particular passage from
    Soda:

    I'm an exception, it's hard to accept
    because I try to be happy, but then I forget.
    They tell me I need to chill man, it's all in your head
    Maybe I am paranoid

    ...

    I once had a thought, but don't know where it went
    coz I have been living on Soda and cheap cigarettes
    **Maybe when I was a kid, I was dropped on my head,
    yeah, that would make some sense!**

    I was on a 3-hour journey from Kharagpur to Calcutta when these lines first
    registered in my brain. I then selected "Repeat 1" in Play Music and heard
    the lyrics again and again and then the song clicked for me!

    This was a great throwback to the Petrol Bunk conversation that Aaron and
    Abe have in Primer.

    Aaron: Maybe your life is in disarray and you start to wonder, what caused
    this? How did things get like this? ... As if, if their mother had breastfed
    them, their lives would have been different.

    Abe: **Bunch of whiners**

    Aaron: Yeah, they're a bunch of whiners. ... What's worse? **Thinking you are
    being paranoid or knowing you should be?**

    (_P.S._ If you thought my Primer obsession had run it's course, you've got
    another thing coming)

* Album 3: **Modern Vampires of the City by Vampire Weekend**

    ![img](/public/img/music-aug-2017-modern-vampires.png)

    I already said, this was one hell of a good month of music! Almost no
    repetition except for music I found this month and I liked most of what I
    heard.

    I have already talked about this a bit in the [last music
    update](https://blog.siddharthkannan.in/music/monthly/update/arcade-fire/nothing-but-thieves/2017/08/12/july-music-update/),

    I found this album on Spotify Discover, which is KA-RAZY! My favourites are
    still tracks 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10! This album is the one I am going to go back
    to when I need something to brighten my day. The happiness in this album is
    contagious. A sample passage from Hannah Hunt, if you tend to not beleive
    me:

    > A man of faith said, "Hidden eyes could see what I was thinking",
    > I just smiled and told him, that was only true of Hannah,
    > and we glided on through Waverley and Lincoln
    >
    > Days were long and nights no longer, count the seconds, watching hours,
    > though we live on the US Dollar, you and me, got our sense of time!

    Common! What did I say?

* **Recommendations**

    Song | Album | Artist
    --- | --- | ---
    Finger Back | Modern Vampires of the City | Vampire Weekend
    Reset Me | Broken Machine | Nothing but Thieves
    Hazy Shade of Winter | Bookends | Simon and Garfunkel

    _About this section:_ I know everyone has songs that they want you to hear.
    I also know how hard it is to listen to something and be present and not
    just glide through it.  So, I am starting this section on music updates
    where I get to pick 3 songs from that month which I absolutely want you to
    hear. (I figure this will give the posts a sense of structure that they miss
    right now!)

    I also plan to select from the less famous songs that I loved from that
    month, because I figure that you will eventually hear the popular ones. Like
    Sorry and Amsterdam from Broken Machine are blowing up on YouTube and you
    are probably going to hear it eventually!
