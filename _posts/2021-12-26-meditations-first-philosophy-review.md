Descartes has a gift for reasoning that I will not attempt to summarize in the few paragraphs of
this review. Descartes' essay is worth reading if you have ever wondered about the philosophy behind
his saying "I think, therefore I am." It is worth reading if you have a few hours to yourself and
you want to _think_. It is challenging, and some of the philosophy went over my head. Despite that,
I got a basic understanding of what he was trying to do. He attempts to reason from scratch to prove
the existence of the "soul" and of "God," for he believes that if he is able to prove their
existence, then even the most irreligious person would follow his reasoning and become religious. I
was not completely convinced by his logic in this regard, with regard to his _proof_ of God's
existence. But I _was_ convinced about the reasoning behind his quote connecting doubting, thinking
and existence[^1]. In this review, I have explained both Descartes' lines of reasoning and the
doubts that arose within me when I followed these lines "without prejudice"[^2].

# Descartes' Reasoning


## Doubt and Denial

First off, Descartes tells us to do something _apparently_ elementary: Deny anything that might have
even a shadow of doubt associated with it.

For e.g., Is your body your own? Let's go down this rabbit hole just as Descartes tells us to:

1.  When you're asleep, you might dream yourself to be inhabiting another body
2.  When you're dreaming, the dream appears as real to you as reality does when you're awake
3.  Your mind thinks that your body is your own
4.  Your mind thinks that the body you inhabit when you dream is **also** your own
5.  Another mind could think that your body is its own when that mind is dreaming
6.  Hence, your body _might_ belong to another mind!

There! That's a shadow of doubt. So, deny the original question:

**Q:** Is your body your own?

**A:** No; for there is some doubt whether my mind is the only thing that owns it.

This sounds ridiculous; but according to Descartes, this is how philosophy should be done. We must
start with nothing and reason to something.


## My Mind Exists. I Exist.

With the above example, it is clear that your body is not your own. What about your mind? Here,
Descartes makes his first major claim. Your mind **is** your own as it produces thoughts. A thought
can exist separate from the mind that produced it. And thus, that is what I am: _I_ am a thinking
thing, with a mind of my own, that I use to produce thoughts.

I know _what_ I am. But what about my existence? For it is quite obvious, that I could be
_something_ but not exist. (**E.g.:** I know what a building with 1000 floors is. But that building
does not exist. So, I should prove the existence of that building separately.)

So, do _I_ exist? **Yes!** Rejoice! I _know_ that _I_ exist because it was _I_ who thought and judged
my existence. To produce a thought, there **must** be a thinking thing that produced it and that
thinking thing is _me._


## God Exists

Let us accept the following axioms[^3]:

1.  A thing that is not perfect can't produce a thing that is perfect
2.  Something cannot come into being from nothing

Now, look into yourself, and follow the following line of reasoning:

1.  I have the idea of God: a perfect, infinite being
2.  I am not perfect
3.  I am finite
4.  Thus, my mind, a thinking thing, can't produce the thought of a perfect and infinite being for it
    is neither perfect nor infinite
5.  Hence, this thought must have been placed into my mind by a being that is perfect and infinite
6.  I choose to call this being God
7.  **God Exists!**

Well, there you have it. That's the line Descartes takes to prove his hypothesis.


# My Doubts

As I said in the introduction, I was not convinced by the author's reasoning. Here are some of the
doubts that entered my head as I read this essay.


## The Nature of Thoughts

Let me go back to something that a reader might question:

> To produce a thought, there **must** be a thinking thing that produced it and that thinking thing is
> _me._

Elsewhere, Descartes says the following:

> Something cannot come into being from nothing.

I said before that Descartes wants to start from scratch. And yet, when I made the above statement
to explain Descartes' reasoning and when Descartes said something similar, I am accepting that to be
true.  Where did this "thought" come from? Or, more simply,

_Who produced the thought "a thought can't exist until a thinking thing produces it" in my mind?_

This is the axiom[^3] that Descartes relies on.


## God's Existence Hinges On A Definition

In the above reasoning the whole argument hinges on the fact that the thought inside us about God is
that **He is perfect and infinite**.

What if the thought inside us is that "God exists, but has flaws"? Well, you see where this is
going.

There is a cheeky way out of this conundrum: Simply accept Descartes' definition of God. This is a
reasonable way to understand philosophy.

To prove the existence of something, one must begin with a definition of that thing. And if we are
to follow Descartes' reasoning, then we should accept his definition too.


# Omissions from this review

I have omitted some of the things from this essay that I found to be _very_ unconvincing.


## God Exists, Approach 2

In Chapter 5, Descartes considers the question about whether God exists once again and "proves" this
using another approach. But the second approach contradicts some assumptions I made to understand
the original approach. I can't bring myself to reject the assumptions I made for the first proof and
engage with the second proof, which asks me to assume the opposite thing. A thing and the opposite
of that thing can't both be true at the same time, and hence, only the proof that involves one of
those things can be accepted.

Briefly, the author says that God exists because I _understand_ him as clearly and distinctly as I
understand that a Triangle exists.

I have 2 objections to this line.

Firstly, to justify Descartes' original line of reasoning, I started with the idea that I don't
understand anything and don't accept any thing's existence unless proven. So, in that frame of mind,
I can't really start from the idea that a Triangle exists.

Secondly, I _don't_ think that I understand God "clearly and distinctly." In fact, it is most
unclear to me what God would look like or is capable of, unlike a Triangle which I understand much
better: I know that it has three sides, I know that the sum of two sides is more than the third, I
know that the sum of all angles will be 180 degrees, and so on.

So, this approach was even less appealing to me than the first one.


## Errors in Judgment

This was another place where there were too many circular reasoning steps to justify including it in
the review. He starts with the question,

> Why do I commit errors in judgment, when I accept that God, who is perfect and infinite, created me?

To this, he has a simple solution: I am incomplete and imperfect. So, I simply can't understand the
answer to my question even if it were presented to me. So, I should _just_ not bother.

After giving this answer, he goes on to provide some suggestions for how we might avoid errors in
judgment and these are positively insane:

1.  Refrain from making a judgment about anything that is not clearly and precisely understood by the
    intellect
2.  Withhold judgment on anything whose truth is unknown

[That is no way to live!](https://youtu.be/dwkEgKEyBIo)


## Proving that God is Perfect and Infinite

Descartes makes (what I can only decode as) a halfhearted attempt to prove that God is perfect and
infinite. He says that while it is possible for me, a finite being, to be created by someone who is
only marginally more finite than me, it is not the truth.

Because there are so many things on Earth and there is the Earth itself and so on. So, everyone and
everything's cause of existence is necessarily infinite.

If you are not convinced by that argument, neither was I.

Another thing he says to prove it is, "the idea of God [as a perfect and infinite being] is innate
within me." Clearly, this statement is even less useful than the previous one. A child that hasn't
been initiated into the ways of religion and common thoughts about God does not have this idea
innate within them; it is society and the child's observation of society that gives rise to this
idea inside her.


## Dreams vs. Reality, resolved

In Chapter 6 of the book, Descartes tries to resolve the split between dreaming and
reality. However, I did not understand this meditation at all. He pieces together several arguments
from his previous meditations and proves it _somehow._


# Quotes

> Finally, as to my parents, even if everything that I ever believed about them were true, still it is

> I perceive that the power of willing, which I got from God, is not, taken by itself, the cause of my

> from the true and the good; and in this way I am deceived and I sin

<!--quoteend-->

> However, as far as God is concerned, if I were not overwhelmed by prejudices and if the images of

[^1]: The full quote is "I doubt, therefore I think; I think, therefore I am."
[^2]: Descartes counsels the reader early in the essay that they should read ahead only if they are willing to put their prejudices aside and meditate with him on the subject at hand. He also says "Discerning men are few and far between," which was probably the only light, humorous line in all of the 77 pages.
[^3]: I am using "axiom" here in [its dictionary sense](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/axiom). Namely, "a statement accepted as true as the basis for argument or inference."
