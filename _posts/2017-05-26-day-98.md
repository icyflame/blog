08:00 pm: Walk into a restaurant for dinner with a few friends and seniors from IIT
KGP.

11:30 pm: Decide to step outside and be faced with one feet of water in every
direction the eye can see.

Reaction: WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED HERE?

The best reference to come up with here is: [July 26, 2005,
Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra_floods_of_2005)

I was there, 9 years old at the time. Hardly understanding what the fuss was
about, schools weren't there for a few days I was definitely real happy about
_THAT_. There was a lot of stuff going on at that time in the city, I got to
know of most of them after the fact. As stories that were recounted several
times whenever the topic of flooding came back.

As I am reading the wikipedia page, I am extremely surprised to see that there
were PAPERS written on the topic!

> Andharia (2006) contrasts the "widespread acts of generosity and altruism" in
> Mumbai with the general social disorder that was seen in the aftermath of
> Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.

Well well well. I don't want to read that paper because it is probably
blabbering on and on about _Indian culture and tradition_ and the helping
tendency of Mumbaikars etc. There's nothing worth being in a paper there. And
especially, comparing to something like a Hurricane in the US which was properly
managed is unfair.

12 years on, I waded through knee deep water for about 700 m before we were on
High ground again and able to reach home safely.
